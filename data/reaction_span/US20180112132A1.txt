TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention belongs to the technical field of liquid crystal compounds and applications, and relates to liquid crystal compounds of cycloalkyl-containing dibenzofuran derivatives, a preparation method therefor and use thereof.
BACKGROUND ART
Since the Austrian scientist Reinitzer first synthesized a liquid crystal in 1888, the actual development of the liquid crystal industry is in the recent more than 30 years; since liquid crystal display materials have obvious advantages, such as a low drive voltage, a small power consumption, high reliability, a great display information amount, color display, no flicker, a capability of achieving panel display, etc., both liquid crystal monomers and liquid crystal displays have gone through a huge development, and liquid crystal monomers have been used in the synthesis of more than 10,000 kinds of liquid crystal materials, wherein there are thousands of common liquid crystal display materials, and by the classification according to the characteristics of the central bridge bond and rings of liquid crystal molecules, there are mainly biphenyl liquid crystals, phenyl cyclohexane liquid crystals, ester liquid crystals, alkynes, difluoromethoxy bridge types, ethane types and heterocyclic types. The liquid crystal display is also developed from TN and STN of black and white small screen in 30 years ago to the current TN-TFT, VA-TFT, IPS-TFT, PDLC of scale color screen, etc.
New liquid crystal display modes mainly include optical compensation bending mode (OCB), coplanar transformation liquid crystal display (IPS), vertical alignment mode (VA), axisymmetric microstructure liquid crystal display (ASM), multi-domain twisted liquid crystal display, etc.
In the various display modes, liquid crystal cells have different designs and different driving methods, and the orientations of liquid crystal molecular directors with respect to glass substrates are different, wherein in the optical compensation bending mode (OCB) and the coplanar transformation liquid crystal display (IPS), liquid crystal molecular directors are parallel to the direction of the glass substrates, while in the vertical alignment mode (VA) and the axisymmetric microstructure liquid crystal display (ASM), the liquid crystal molecular directors are perpendicular to the direction of the glass substrates in the absence of an electric field.
With regard to the IPS of the parallel arranged mode, the dielectric anisotropy (Δε) of the crystal may be either positive or negative.
In the vertical alignment mode (VA), all liquid crystal molecules in a null field are perpendicular to the direction of the glass substrates and parallel to a vertical incident light. When a polarizer is orthogonal, a good dark state is shown; therefore, this kind of device has a good contrast, and the dielectric anisotropy (Δε) of the crystal used has to be negative. The optical anisotropy (Δn) of the crystal, the thickness (d) of the liquid crystal cell and the wavelength (λ) of the incident light barely affect the contrast. The response time of the vertical alignment mode (VA) is much shorter than that of a twist-type device and is about half of that. Under the influence of an applied voltage, a VA device mainly produces a bending deformation of liquid crystal molecules, ECB produces a splay deformation of liquid crystal molecules, and the twisted display produces a twist deformation of liquid crystal molecules; the response times thereof are also inversely proportional to bending, splay, and twist elastic constants, respectively, because in general cases for most liquid crystals, the bending elastic constant of liquid crystal is greater than the splay elastic constant and the splay elastic constant is greater than the twist elastic constant, which is also the reason why the VA device has a faster response time.
In Patent US 20150259602, the following compound is disclosed:
wherein R' and R″ represent alkyl groups. Since the presence of the two side fluorines and the rigid structure dibenzofuran in the molecule limits the deflection between the two benzene rings, this type of compound has a higher absolute value of dielectric anisotropy and a very high birefringence. However, also because of the presence of the rigid dibenzofuran ring, such an alkyl-substituted liquid crystal compound has a poorer intersolubility and readily precipitates at low temperatures. In order to enable the performance of a display device to be closer to ideal, people have always been working to study new liquid crystal compounds, which allows the performances of liquid crystal compounds and display devices to continuously advance.

Due to the presence of the rigid structure and the two side fluorines in the molecule, dibenzofuran-based crystals exhibit greater negative dielectric constants, and the presence of the rigid structure also results in a poorer the solubility of such compounds, which limits the use thereof. Surprisingly, when a cycloalkyl group is introduced into the dibenzofuran liquid crystal molecule, the resulting liquid crystal compound exhibits a better intersolubility than this type of liquid crystal compounds traditionally having flexible alkyl chains as terminal groups, and thus the use of a compound as represented by formula I provided by the present invention can improve the intersolubility of a liquid crystal compound and extend the application range of a liquid crystal mixture, producing an important application value.

As can be seen from the performance parameters of the liquid crystal compositions shown in Examples 6-12, the liquid crystal compositions of the present invention have a very good intersolubility and a very great negative dielectric constant; moreover, as can be seen upon the comparison between Example 10 and Example 13, the dibenzofuran-based liquid crystal compound having the cycloalkyl as the terminal group, compared with the dibenzofuran-based liquid crystal having the traditional flexible alkyl chain as the terminal group, exhibits a better intersolubility, and thus the use of a compound as represented by formula i provided by the present invention can improve the intersolubility of a liquid crystal compound and extend the application range of a liquid crystal mixture, producing an important application value.
Although only the specific compounds of the above-mentioned 8 examples and the compounding amounts (weight percentage content) thereof are listed and subjected to a performance test in the present invention, the liquid crystal compositions of the present invention can be further expanded and modified on the basis of the above-mentioned examples using the liquid crystal compounds represented by general formulas I, IV and V and the preferred liquid crystal compounds of general formulas I, IV and V, and they can all achieve the object of the present invention by appropriately adjusting the ratio thereof.
