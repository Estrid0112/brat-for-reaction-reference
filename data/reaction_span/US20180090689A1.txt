BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
A compound for an organic optoelectric device, a composition for an organic optoelectric device, an organic optoelectric device, and a display device are disclosed.
2. Description of the Related Art
An organic optoelectric device is a device that converts electrical energy into photoenergy, and vice versa.
An organic optoelectric device may be classified as follows in accordance with its driving principles. One is a photoelectric device where excitons are generated by photoenergy, separated into electrons and holes, and are transferred to different electrodes to generate electrical energy, and the other is a light emitting device where a voltage or a current is supplied to an electrode to generate photoenergy from electrical energy.
The organic optoelectric device may for example include an organic photoelectric device, an organic light emitting diode, an organic solar cell, an organic photo conductor drum, and the like.
Of these, an organic light emitting diode (OLED) has recently drawn attention due to an increase in demand for flat panel displays. The organic light emitting diode is a device converting electrical energy into light by applying current to an organic light emitting material, and has a structure in which an organic layer is disposed between an anode and a cathode. Herein, the organic layer may include a light emitting layer and optionally an auxiliary layer, and the auxiliary layer may be, for example at least one layer selected from a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an electron blocking layer, an electron transport layer, an electron injection layer, and a hole blocking layer.
Performance of an organic light emitting diode may be affected by characteristics of the organic layer, and among them, may be mainly affected by characteristics of an organic material of the organic layer.
Particularly, development for an organic material being capable of increasing hole and electron mobility and simultaneously increasing electrochemical stability is needed so that the organic light emitting diode may be applied to a large-size flat panel display.

Manufacture of Organic Light Emitting Diode (Light Emitting Layer Device-Single Host)
Example 1
An organic light emitting diode was manufactured by using Compound 2 obtained in Synthesis Example 1 as a host and Ir(Ply)3 as a dopant.
As for an anode, 1000 Å-thick ITO was used, and as for a cathode, 1000 Å-thick aluminum was used. Specifically, illustrating a method of manufacturing the organic light emitting diode, the anode is manufactured by cutting an ITO glass substrate having 15 Ω/cm2 of a sheet resistance into a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm, ultrasonic wave-cleaning them in each acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and pure water for 15 minutes respectively, and UV ozone cleaning them for 30 minutes.
On the substrate, an 800 Å-thick hole transport layer was formed by depositing N4,N4'-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N4,N4'-diphenylbiphenyl-4,4'-diamine (NPB) (80 nm) under a vacuum degree of 650×10−7 Pa at a deposition rate of 0.1 to 0.3 nm/s. Subsequently, a 300 Å-thick light emitting layer was formed by using Compound 2 of Synthesis Example 1 under the same vacuum deposition condition, and a phosphorescent dopant of Ir(PPy)3 was simultaneously deposited. Herein, the phosphorescent dopant was deposited to be 10 wt % based on 100 wt % of a total weight of the light emitting layer by adjusting the deposition rate.
On the light emitting layer, a 50 Å-thick hole blocking layer was formed by depositing bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolate)-4-(phenylphenolato)aluminum (BAlq) under the same vacuum deposition condition. Subsequently, a 200 Å-thick electron transport layer was formed by depositing Alq3 under the same vacuum deposition condition. On the electron transport layer, a cathode was formed by sequentially depositing LiF and Al to manufacture an organic light emitting diode.
A structure of the organic light emitting diode was ITO/NPB (80 nm)/EML (Compound 2 (90 wt %) Ir(PPy)3 (10 wt %), 30 nm)/BAlq (5 nm)/Alq3 (20 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm).

An organic light emitting diode was manufactured according to the same method as Example 18 except for using Compound 5 instead of Compound 2 in the light emitting layer.
Comparative Example 8
An organic light emitting diode was manufactured according to the same method as Example 2 except for not including the hole transport layer.
Evaluation Example 2: Evaluation of Characteristics of Organic Light Emitting Diode (II)
A driving voltage, efficiency, luminance, and a life-span of each organic light emitting diode according to Examples 18 and 19 and Comparative Examples 5 and 8 were measured according to the same method as Evaluation Example 1 by supplying power from a current voltage meter (Kethley SMU 236) and using a luminance meter, PR650 Spectroscan Source Measurement Unit (Photo Research Inc.), and the results are shown in Table 3.
