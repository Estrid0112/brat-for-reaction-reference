Technical Field
The present invention relates to a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound that is useful as a chemokine CXCL10 inhibitor.
Background Art
CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10) is a CXC chemokine also known as IP-10 (interferon gamma inducible protein 10). Upon partial damage of living tissues by infection or the like, chemotactic factors such as CXCL10 and MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1) are produced. As a result, monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils are infiltrated into inflammatory tissues.
It has been suggested that immune diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus and autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease develop due to the increased production of CXCL10. Therefore, a compound having an excellent CXCL10 inhibitory activity is considered to be useful as an agent for treatment such as prophylaxis and/or therapy of a disease involving the overproduction of CXCL10 (Patent Literature 1).

Test Example 1
(CXCL10 production inhibition test)
0.5 × 104 or 1 × 104 human umbilical vein-derived endothelial cells were suspended in 100 µL of an EGM-2 BulletKit medium (without GA) or a Medium-200 medium supplemented with an EGM-2 SingleQuots kit (without GA), inoculated to a 96-well plate and cultured overnight. 100 µL of a solution of each test compound diluted with the same medium as that used in the inoculation was added to the cultured cells (final concentration of the test compound: 0.1 µmol/L). 1 hour thereafter, TNFα was added thereto at a final concentration of 10 ng/mL. 72 hours after the stimulation, the supernatant was recovered, and the amount of CXCL10 produced in the culture supernatant was determined using an ELISA kit (Peprotech, 900-K39).
The rate of inhibition was calculated according to the following expression:
Rate of inhibition (%) = 100 - (Amount of CXCL10 produced in the presence of the test compound / Amount of CXCL10 produced in the absence of the test compound) × 100
