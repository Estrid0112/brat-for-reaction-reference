The present disclosure relates to novel compounds, pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and their use in prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions.
Estrogen Receptor alpha is a nuclear receptor that is activated by the hormone estrogen. Upon estrogen binding, Estrogen Receptor alpha undergoes a conformational change and dimerizes, which, along with other regulation factors, leads to a proliferation of cancerous cells. Approximately 75% of breast cancers express Estrogen Receptor alpha and exhibit estrogen-dependent proliferation. Morales, A. R., et al. Am. J. Clin. Path. 2005; 123: 21-27. Estrogen Receptor alpha is implicated in a variety of cancers, such as, but not limited to, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, prostate cancer, and esophageal cancer. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women, and its incidence rate increases every year.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are compounds that interact with intracellular Estrogen Receptors and act as agonists or antagonists. SERMs are used for treating various estrogen-related diseases, including breast cancer, infertility, ovulatory dysfunction, postmenopausal osteoporosis, estrogen-related gynecomastia, dyspareunia due to menopause, retroperitoneal fibrosis, and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been reported that SERMs have beneficial effects on serum lipids in postmenopausal women.
Tamoxifen is the most commonly used SERM and is widely used in treating Estrogen Receptor alpha positive breast cancer. Unfortunately, Tamoxifen activates other genes, which correlates with an increased incidence of other cancers, for example, endometrial cancer. Bernstein, L. et al. J. Natl Cancer Inst 1999; 91: 1654-62. Further, many cancer patients who receive Tamoxifen will eventually develop resistance. Ring, A. et al. Endocr Relat Cancer 2004; 11: 643-58. Upon failure of Tamoxifen treatment, patients may be prescribed Fulvestrant. Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader via proteasomal degradation.
Tamoxifen competes with estrogen to bind to Estrogen Receptor alpha, whereas Fulvestrant is an antagonist. Fulvestrant's effects are to degrade the Estrogen Receptor alpha protein as opposed to prevent conformational changes and/or dimerization. Although Fulvestrant is an improvement over the deleterious effects of Tamoxifen, Fulvestrant suffers from poor drug-like properties, for example, poor bioavailability and intramuscular administration. Accordingly, there exists a need for an improved method of inhibiting cellular proliferation driven by Estrogen Receptor alpha. Fulvestrant's mechanism of action, where the proteasome is engaged to degrade Estrogen Receptor alpha, provides an alternative mechanism to inhibiting Estrogen Receptor alpha driven cell proliferation. However, general proteasome degradation is not selective, and therefore could lead to deleterious effects. Accordingly, there is a need to discover and develop a drug that could lead to selective Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation, without the side effects caused by Tamoxifen or Fulvestrant.
The present disclosure describes compounds that may be used to bind to both Estrogen Receptor alpha and a ubiquitin ligase. The compounds of the present disclosure possess two binding motifs conjugated via a linker. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation may occur when both Estrogen Receptor alpha and a ubiquitin ligase are bound and brought into close proximity.

These methods of resolution are exemplified by: (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary; (2) salt formation employing an optically active resolving agent; or (3) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns. Stereoisomeric mixtures can also be resolved into their component stereoisomers by well-known methods, such as chiral-phase gas chromatography, chiral-phase high performance liquid chromatography, crystallizing the compound as a chiral salt complex, or crystallizing the compound in a chiral solvent. Stereoisomers can also be obtained from stereomerically-pure intermediates, reagents, and catalysts by well-known asymmetric synthetic methods.
Geometric isomers can also exist in the compounds of the present disclosure. The present disclosure encompasses the various geometric isomers and mixtures thereof resulting from the arrangement of substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond or arrangement of substituents around a carbocyclic ring. Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond are designated as being in the “Z” or “E” configuration wherein the terms “Z” and “E” are used in accordance with IUPAC standards. Unless otherwise specified, structures depicting double bonds encompass both the E and Z isomers.
Substituents around a carbon-carbon double bond alternatively can be referred to as “cis” or “trans,” where “cis” represents substituents on the same side of the double bond and “trans” represents substituents on opposite sides of the double bond. The arrangements of substituents around a carbocyclic ring are designated as “cis” or “trans.” The term “cis” represents substituents on the same side of the plane of the ring and the term “trans” represents substituents on opposite sides of the plane of the ring. Mixtures of compounds wherein the substituents are disposed on both the same and opposite sides of plane of the ring are designated “cis/trans.”
The compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the present disclosure, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted.
Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures described herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium (2H) or tritium (3H), or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-carbon atom are within the scope of this disclosure. Such compounds may be useful as, for example, analytical tools, probes in biological assays, or therapeutic agents.

Pharmaceutical Compositions
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present disclosure comprise at least one compound of Formulae (I), (II), (III), or (IV), or tautomer, stereoisomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate thereof formulated together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. These formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal and parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous) administration. The most suitable form of administration in any given case will depend on the degree and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular compound being used.
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present disclosure as powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. As indicated, such formulations may be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association at least one compound of the present disclosure as the active compound and a carrier or excipient (which may constitute one or more accessory ingredients). The carrier must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and must not be deleterious to the recipient. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid, or both, and may be formulated with at least one compound described herein as the active compound in a unit-dose formulation, for example, a tablet, which may contain from about 0.05% to about 95% by weight of the at least one active compound. Other pharmacologically active substances may also be present including other compounds. The formulations of the present disclosure may be prepared by any of the well-known techniques of pharmacy consisting essentially of admixing the components.
For solid compositions, conventional nontoxic solid carriers include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talc, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. Liquid pharmacologically administrable compositions can, for example, be prepared by, for example, dissolving or dispersing, at least one active compound of the present disclosure as described herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in an excipient, such as, for example, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, and the like, to thereby form a solution or suspension. In general, suitable formulations may be prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the at least one active compound of the present disclosure with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules of at least one compound of the present disclosure, which may be optionally combined with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, at least one compound of the present disclosure in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules, which may be optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets may be made by molding, in a suitable machine, where the powdered form of at least one compound of the present disclosure is moistened with an inert liquid diluent.
Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising at least one compound of the present disclosure in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the at least one compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia.
Formulations of the present disclosure suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous preparations of at least one compound of Formulae (I), (II), or (III), or tautomers, stereoisomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and hydrates thereof, which are approximately isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are administered intravenously, although administration may also be effected by means of subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intradermal injection. Such preparations may conveniently be prepared by admixing at least one compound described herein with water and rendering the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with the blood. Injectable compositions according to the present disclosure may contain from about 0.1 to about 5% w/w of the active compound.
Formulations suitable for rectal administration are presented as unit-dose suppositories. These may be prepared by admixing at least one compound as described herein with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture.
Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin may take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers and excipients which may be used include Vaseline, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, and combinations of two or more thereof. The active compound (i.e., at least one compound of Formulae (I), (II), (III), or (IV), or tautomers, stereoisomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and hydrates thereof) is generally present at a concentration of from about 0.1% to about 15% w/w of the composition, for example, from about 0.5 to about 2%.
The amount of active compound administered may be dependent on the subject being treated, the subject's weight, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. For example, a dosing schedule may involve the daily or semi-daily administration of the encapsulated compound at a perceived dosage of about 1 μg to about 1000 mg. In another embodiment, intermittent administration, such as on a monthly or yearly basis, of a dose of the encapsulated compound may be employed. Encapsulation facilitates access to the site of action and allows the administration of the active ingredients simultaneously, in theory producing a synergistic effect. In accordance with standard dosing regimens, physicians will readily determine optimum dosages and will be able to readily modify administration to achieve such dosages.
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition disclosed herein can be measured by the therapeutic effectiveness of the compound. The dosages, however, may be varied depending upon the requirements of the patient, the severity of the condition being treated, and the compound being used. In one embodiment, the therapeutically effective amount of a disclosed compound is sufficient to establish a maximal plasma concentration. Preliminary doses as, for example, determined according to animal tests, and the scaling of dosages for human administration is performed according to art-accepted practices.
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferable.
Data obtained from the cell culture assays or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in humans. Therapeutically effective dosages achieved in one animal model may be converted for use in another animal, including humans, using conversion factors known in the art (see, e.g., Freireich et al., Cancer Chemother. Reports 50(4):219-244 (1966) and the following Table for Equivalent Surface Area Dosage Factors).

The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. Generally, a therapeutically effective amount may vary with the subject's age, condition, and gender, as well as the severity of the medical condition in the subject. The dosage may be determined by a physician and adjusted, as necessary, to suit observed effects of the treatment.

In FIG. 2, Compound 1 was added at concentrations of 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, 1 μM, and 3 μM, resulting in Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation. In FIGS. 3A and 3B, Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 were added at concentrations varying from 1 nM to 1 μM. Treatment with Compounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 all resulted in degradation of Estrogen Receptor alpha when compared with the control. Compounds 1 and 2 are more potent at inducing Estrogen Receptor alpha degradation than Compounds 3 and 4.
The effect of chain length on potency was studied. MCF7 or LTED cells were plated and grown to 90% confluence overnight. Cells were treated with different compounds, as shown below. To collect protein from cells, cells were washed with PBS and proteins were collected in Laemmli sample buffer (1×) (VWR international). Proteins in cell lysate (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with blocking buffer (5% milk in 1×TBST) at room temperature for 30 minutes. The membranes were then incubated with Primary antibodies mouse anti-ERα (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-actin (1:4,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4° C., followed by washing 3 times with TBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse or anti-goat IgG (1:5,000) for 1 hour. After TBST washes, blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The bands were imaged by chemidock touch system (Bio-Rad) and quantified by ImageJ.
