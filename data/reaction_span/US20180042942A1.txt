The invention relates to squalamine analogs for their use in the treatment of bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic infections or in the treatment of cancer in man or animals, and also to the pharmaceutical or veterinary compositions comprising them.
In 1993, squalamine, a natural steroid, isolated mainly from the tissues of a small shark Squalus acanthias, proved to be a very active substance exhibiting essentially an antiangiogenic activity against cells and an antiviral and antibacterial activity.

Chemically, squalamine is a novel molecule exhibiting an amphiphilic nature. It thus comprises a nonpolar central part (a backbone of cholestane type) and two polar ends (a polyamine chain and a sulfate group).
Initially, this water-soluble polyaminosterol had aroused interest for its antiangiogenic and antimicrobial properties with regard to a variety of Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), fungi (Candia albicans, Candida tropicalis) and protozoa.
As the natural source of squalamine is limited, aminosteroidal analogous synthetic derivatives of squalamine have been looked for. Derivatives or analogs comprising a polyamine chain in the 3 or 7 position of 10,13-dimethyl-17-octyl cholestane or cholestene rings, optionally hydroxylated in the 7 or respectively 3 position, have been described in particular. Derivatives of formula IIa, IIb, IIc, IId and II-1 below have in particular been described as exhibiting an antibacterial activity similar to squalamine with regard to various multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (WO 2011/067501 and references 1 to 7).
<img> id-US20180042942A1-20180215-C00003.TIF </img>
An application of these derivatives in a curative treatment of pulmonary infections by the aerosol route has more particularly been suggested. However, the applicant company has observed that these compounds exhibit a high cytotoxicity and that the compounds of formulae IIc and IId exhibit a low activity against certain Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli.
Compounds analogous to squalamine have now been discovered which exhibit a good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, while advantageously being less cytotoxic than squalamine.
Thus, according to a first subject matter, the invention relates to a compound of formula (I):

According to another preferred alternative form, the invention includes compounds of formula (I) for the treatment of bacterial infections, in particular Gram-positive bacterial infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus faecalis infections, and/or Gram-negative bacterial infections, such as Escherichia Coli or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention are of use in particular in the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections, in particular of strains of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria, in man or in animals. According to one embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) are used in animals, in particular in dogs, cats or ruminants.
By way of example, the compounds according to the invention are of use in the treatment of mastitis, metritis, dental infections, pyodermatitis or otitis, in particular in animals. The compounds according to the invention are also of use in the manufacture of products intended to destroy biofilms.
According to a specific embodiment, the invention relates to the compound SA-10, SA-Y or SA-Z for its use in the treatment of mastitis, metritis, dental infections, pyodermatitis or otitis, in particular in animals. The compound SA-10, SA-Y or SA-Z according to the invention is also of use in the manufacture of products intended to destroy biofilms.
Mastitis is the inflammation of the udder in mammals; it is a common infection in the husbandry of milch females (cows, ewes, she-goats, female buffalos and female camels). It is characterized by the presence, in the milk, of inflammatory cells (leukocytes) and possibly bacteria. This inflammation may have clinical consequences with modification of the appearance of the milk, visible inflammation of the udder (swelling, pain, edema) and possibly attack of the general state. Generally, the disease remains subclinical with detrimental change in the composition of the milk and decrease in production. Mastitis results from an infection of the udder by bacteria more or less adapted to this biotope. In specialized dairy farming, mastitis causes major economic losses (milk not produced, unsuitable for use, detrimental change in the quality of the milk) and constitutes a public health risk (pathogenic bacteria and residual antibiotics). Mastitis is due to the penetration into and then the growth in the mammary gland of a bacterium. The microorganism generally enters through the end of the teat. Mastitis thus generally does not concern all the areas of the udder of the animal. The main bacteria responsible for mastitis can be combined together into two groups, depending on their reservoir of contamination: the microorganisms occurring at the surface of the udder: Staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus disgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis. These bacteria are mainly responsible for subclinical mastitis (not detectable with the naked eye), which is sometimes difficult to cure during lactation; the dry period is then taken advantage of to treat the areas infected with the antibiotics. The microorganisms occurring in the environment (bedding): for example, Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli. These bacteria generally result in clinical mastitis, which can extend as far as the rapid death of the animal in the absence of appropriate treatment. Mycoplasma mastitis still presents problems in goat herds, even if it has currently virtually disappeared appear from cattle herds.
Metritis is an inflammation of the whole of the uterinal wall. It is caused by a bacterial infection and it is virtually always observed after an abnormal parturition or a major uterine infection. Its seriousness ranges from a subclinical infection to an established disease with fever and decrease in milk production. Metritis may predispose cows to ketosis, to displacement of the abomasum and to other postpartum disorders. It can also result in a fall in the fertility, temporary or permanent, and even, in some cases, to the death of the animal. Metritis is often related to contamination of the uterus by the bacterium Arcanobacterium pyogenes, either alone or in conjunction with other pathogenic microorganisms, such as: Fusobacterium necrophorum, Bacteroides spp. or Escherichia coli. Immediately after calving, the uterus constitutes an ideal environment for bacterial growth. During the first postpartum week, up to 90% of cows are victims of a uterine infection of bacterial origin.
Pyodermatitis is a purulent skin disease which may be acute or chronic and local or diffuse. Pyodermatitis is etymologically an infection of the skin. It is of external origin, caused by a bacterium, generally staphylococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes. A pyodermatitis can be circumscribed or generalized. In dogs, pyotraumatic dermatitis is often observed. It is a skin lesion resulting from a compulsion to scratch, nibble at and lick part of the body. As soon as the lesion is big enough, secondary infection by opportunist bacteria may occur, leading the animal to further nibble or scratch itself The majority of the animals often affected have allergies: particularly animals allergic to fleas. However, any skin irritation may bring about pyotraumatic dermatitis.
Otitis is an inflammation of the auditory canal. It is an extremely frequent pathology in domestic carnivores, in particular dogs. It can have numerous causes, some which will be responsible for recurrent otitis. Several types of bacteria (Staphylococci, Pseudomonas, and the like) and yeasts (Malassezia) can grow in the auditory canal, resulting in the appearance of otitis. These types of otitis are then associated with purulent secretions and with a very unpleasant odor.
Periodontal disease or dental infection is the main cause of dental disease in dogs. In spite of being characterized by bad breath, it is often not identified by the owner. Its prevention involves regular care as it can result in the loss of the teeth, indeed even in serious infections. The presence of bacteria in the mouth is normal but, when they grow too rapidly, they can result in the formation of dental plaque. If the plaque accumulates and is not removed, gingivitis (inflammation of the gums) may appear. At this stage, the treatment may be completely curative. However, in the absence of treatment, the disease develops into periodontitis, characterized by a greater inflammation of the gums, deposits of tartar on the teeth and the disappearance of the bone and of the supporting structures surrounding the tooth. The attack can be taken care of but is irreversible. Periodontitis can result in the loss of the teeth and the propagation of serious infections in the liver, heart or lungs.

The chemical structures synthesized were all confirmed by a proton (1H) and/or carbon (13C) NMR analysis in deuterated chloroform CDCl3 or deuterated methanol CD3OD on a device of Bruker AC 300 type. The chemical shifts δ are expressed in ppm. The recording frequencies of the nuclei and also the references used are as follows:
1H NMR: 300 MHz, Si(CH3)4
13C NMR: 75 MHz, Si(CH3)4
The abbreviations used for writing the 1H NMR spectrum are as follows:s=singletd=doublett=tripletq=quartetm=broad unresolved peak
The mass spectra were produced at the Spectropole of Aix-Marseille III. They are produced on the dry product using a Triple Quadrupole API III Plus spectrometer from Sciex. The sample is dissolved in 500 μl of CH2Cl2 and then diluted to 1/104 in a 3 mM solution of ammonium acetate in MeOH. The solution of the extract is introduced into the ionization source by infusion (syringe driver pump, Harvard Apparatus) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min.

The mixture is brought to 50° C. 200 mg of benzoyl peroxide are added and air is bubbled through for 72 h while adjusting the level of the solvent and while monitoring the handling by thin-layer chromatography. After 72 h, the solvent is evaporated under vacuum. The residue is dissolved in petroleum ether and washed with sodium carbonate until the orange coloration disappears. The organic phases are washed with a saturated NaCl solution and dried over MgSO4. The solvent is driven off under vacuum and the sterol is dissolved in pyridine (200 ml). Cooling is carried out at 0° C. and 1 g of CuCl2 is added. The solution is stirred for 24 h (return from 0° C. to ambient temperature). The solution obtained is poured onto a water/ice mixture. Extraction is carried out with ethyl acetate and washing is carried out with a saturated CuSO4 solution. After separation of the phases, the organic phase is washed with a 0.1N HCl solution and dried over MgSO4. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue is chromatographed on silica gel (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1/1). The expected ketone is obtained in the form of an off white solid with a yield of 70%.

Synthesis of the Aminosteroidal Derivatives SA-1 to SA-12
The aminosteroidal derivatives were all produced according to the same procedure. Let us consider the example of the molecule SA-1.
3.3 equivalents of spermine (171 mg, 0.82 mmol) are dissolved in 5 ml of MeOH in a two-necked round-bottomed flask placed under argon and then 300 μl of Ti(O(i-Pr))4 (1 mmol) are added. After stirring for 5 minutes, 102 mg of 3-keto-7α-hydroxycholestane 5b (0.25 mmol) are added to the mixture. After stirring for 24 hours, the round-bottomed flask is placed at −78° C. and then 40 mg of NaBH4 (1 mmol) are added with stirring. After 2 hours and returning to ambient temperature, 1 ml of water is added in order to terminate the reaction. After stirring for an additional 1 h, the mixture is filtered through celite. The filtrate is evaporated under vacuum and the product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (eluent: CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH4OH (7/3/1)).

II. Evaluation of the Biological Activities
A. Intrinsic Antibacterial Activities of the Compounds of Formula (I)
1) Preparation of the Preculture
Two tubes were prepared:
A negative control (2 ml of sterile culture medium)
A positive control (1940 μl of culture medium+40 μl of DMSO+20 μl of the bacterial suspension) from a defrosted biological strain (the preservation of the biological strains is carried out at −80° C. in glycerol). The strains used are S. aureus ATCC 25923, E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853, C. albicans CIP 1180-79 and E. faecalis CIP 103015.
The tubes were incubated in an Infors at 37° C. for 24 hours at 100 revolutions per minute.
The microorganisms were handled under a hood in the laboratory of L2 type and, before any handling operation, a UV cycle was programmed and only sterile material was used. A test of toxicity of the solvents (methanol, ethanol, DMSO) was carried out and the latter proved to be nontoxic at concentrations of less than or equal to 2%. The chemical molecules to be tested were prepared in a DMSO/methanol (50/50) mixture at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.
2) Preparation of the Microplate for the Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC)
After incubating for 24 h, the optical density was measured using a spectrophotometer at 600 nm by withdrawing 100 μl of the bacterial suspension diluted in 900 μl of the sterile culture medium. This test required the use of a 96-well plate and the necessary volume of the microbial suspension to be inoculated was calculated for an OD corresponding to a value equal to 0.01 in each well. In this plate, the first line corresponded to the negative control (195 μl of sterile culture medium in each well), the second line to the positive control (inoculated culture medium with the addition of 2% of DMSO), the third line was charged twice with bacterial suspension, 8 μl of product to be tested was placed in each well. Subsequently, cascade half dilution was carried out starting from this line.
The first column was used as inhibition control. A sterile filter was subsequently placed on the microplate, allowing the passage of gases but not of contaminants. The microplate was incubated at 37° C. in a humid atmosphere for 24 h.
NB: The medium used is the Mueller-Hinton (MH) medium for the bacteria. All the tests were carried out in duplicate.
3) Reading of the Results
After incubation, the filter was replaced with a transparent film and subsequently reading of OD was carried out in an IEMS plate spectrophotometer at 620 nm. A calculation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was carried out.

B. Comparison of the Cytotoxicity and of the Antibacterial Activities of the Compounds of Formula (I) with Those of the Compounds (IIa), (IIb), (IIc) and (IId) Disclosed in the Application WO 2011/067501
The WST-1 test was used to measure the cytotoxic activity of the products. This is a colorimetric test which makes it possible to measure the viability and the degree of cell proliferation. It is based on the cleaving of colorless tetrazolium salts WST-1 (4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzenedisulfonate) by mitochondrial dehydrogenases to give a yellow-colored formazan derivative, which are quantifiable by spectrophotometry at 420-480 nm.
The WST-1 test was carried out on Chinese hamster ovary cells. The CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, USA) are kept cultured in McCoy's 5 A medium additivated with 10% of fetal calf serum, with 2 mM of L-glutamine and with a penicillin/streptomycin mixture (100 U/ml: 10 μg/ml). Incubating is carried out at 37° C. under an atmosphere enriched in CO2 (5%) and subculturing is carried out every two days.
The cells are transferred into 96-well plates (25 000 cells/ml) in complete McCoy's 5 A medium and are maintained at 37° C. for 24 h under a humid atmosphere enriched in CO2 (5%). Increasing concentrations of test products are added to the wells in duplicate tests and 8 growth controls containing the cells in the medium alone are included in each series of tests. After 24 hours at 37° C. (5% of CO2), the culture medium is removed, the cells are rinsed in phosphate buffer (PBS) and 50 μl of PBS containing 10% of WST-1 reactant are added to each well. After incubating at 37° C. for 20 minutes, the results are read by spectrophotometry at 450 nm.
The results are expressed in the form of dose-response relationships, modeled by a nonlinear regression analysis using the TableCurve software. The 50% Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) represents the concentration of product capable of reducing cell viability by 50%.
The following compounds (IIa), (IIb), (IIc) and (IId) were prepared by following the synthesis protocol disclosed in the application WO 2011/067501:
<img> id-US20180042942A1-20180215-C00034.TIF </img>
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the cytotoxicity (IC50) were evaluated according to the experimental protocols above.

It is found that the compounds of formula (I) are less cytotoxic than the compounds IIa, IIb, IIc and IId tested and exhibits a greater antibacterial activity than that of the compounds IIc and IId with regard to the E. coli Gram-negative bacteria.
C. Potentiating of the Activity of Conventional Antibiotics in the Presence of the Aminosteroidal Derivatives of Formula (I)
Example of Preparation of the Microplate for the Determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Doxycycline in the Presence of an Aminosteroidal Derivative
This method requires the use of a 96-well plate; 100 μl of a liquid culture medium are deposited in each well and then inoculated with the microbial suspension prepared above. The necessary volume to be inoculated is calculated for an OD of 0.01, which corresponds to approximately 5×106 bacteria in each well. In this plate, the first line corresponds to a negative control (200 μl of sterile culture medium in each well), the second line to a positive control (100 μl of sterile culture medium+100 μl of a bacterial suspension), the third line contains 192 μl of culture medium; 8 μl of aminosteroidal product to be tested are placed in each well. Subsequently, cascade dilution is carried out starting from this line. 8 μl of a doxycycline solution (1 mg dissolved in 20 ml) are subsequently added to each well of lines 3 to 8, in order to obtain a final concentration of antibiotic of 2 μg/ml. 92 μl of bacterial suspension are subsequently added to lines 3 to 8. The results (the determination of the MIC (2 μg/ml of doxycycline) in the presence of X μg/ml of aminosteroidal derivative) are read after incubating at 37° C. for 24 h in a humid atmosphere. After incubating at 37° C. for 24 h, 40 μl of nitrotetrazolium iodide are added to each well, making it possible to reveal the presence of living bacteria by coloring the medium pink.
In these first tests, the aim was to demonstrate or not a synergy of the aminosteroidal derivatives in the presence of a low concentration of two conventional antibiotics: doxycycline and chloramphenicol.
It should first of all be mentioned that, with regard to the Gram-negative strain of P. aeruginosa (PAO1), doxycycline has an MIC of 40 μg/ml and chloramphenicol an MIC of 1024 μg/ml.
The use of low amounts of aminosteroidal derivatives makes it possible to restore (to reduce) the necessary concentration of antibiotic to kill the strain under consideration. The results are recorded in the table below:

A very good synergy of certain compounds with doxycycline is observed, thus restoring the activity of this antibiotic at low concentrations of use (2 μg/ml). In the case of chloramphenicol, the results are also encouraging since the MIC changes from 1024 to 4 μg/ml for fairly low doses of compounds to be added.
