TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a method for producing a bisimide dicarboxylic acid.
BACKGROUND ART
A bisimide dicarboxylic acid made from a tricarboxylic acid anhydride and a diamine is industrially useful as a dicarboxylic acid raw material for polymers such as polyamide-imide and polyesterimide.
As a method for producing a bisimide dicarboxylic acid, there has been known a method in which a tricarboxylic acid anhydride and a diamine are reacted in a solvent (such as aliphatic carboxylic acids, N,N-dialkylcarboxylamides, alcohols, esters, and halogenated hydrocarbons). However, since the reaction is carried out in a solvent in the above method, it is necessary to separate and purify the bisimide dicarboxylic acid from the reaction solution after completion of the reaction in order to use the resulting bisimide dicarboxylic acid as a polymer raw material. Thus, it takes much time and energy.
Patent Document 1 discloses a method for mixing and reacting an aromatic tricarboxylic acid anhydride and a diamine. However, although the method of Patent Document 1 does not require separation and purification after completion of the reaction, mixing by an extruder, a kneader or the like is carried out, so that the resulting bisimide dicarboxylic acid is obtained in bulk. In order to use the bisimide dicarboxylic acid as a polymer raw material, the bisimide dicarboxylic acid should be granulated by pulverization, classification or the like. Thus, it takes much time and energy.

The diamine may contain -O- and -S-, and one or more hydrogen atoms may be replaced by halogen or may have a side chain.
Specific examples of the diamine include hexamethylenediamine, heptamethylenediamine, octamethylenediamine, nonamethylenediamine, decamethylenediamine, m-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, m-xylylenediamine, p-xylylenediamine, benzidine, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylpropane, 4,4'-diaminodiphenylmethane, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfide, 3,3'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone, 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl ether, 1,5-diaminonaphthalene, 3,3-diaminonaphthalene, 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, 1,10-diamino-1,10-dimethyldecane, and 1,4-bis (aminomethyl) cyclohexane.

These diamines may be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.
The production method of the present invention includes the following processes (i) and (ii).
Process (i): a process in which, provided that a compound having a higher melting point is a high melting compound and a compound having a lower melting point is a low melting compound, when a melting point is compared between the tricarboxylic acid anhydride and the diamine, the high melting compound is heated at a temperature between less than the melting point of the high melting compound and not lower than the melting point of the low melting compound, and the low melting compound is added to the high melting compound while the high melting compound maintains its solid states, to give a mixture.
Process (ii): a process in which the resultant mixture in the process (i) is heated while its solid states are kept, to give bisimide dicarboxylic acid.
The process (i) is a process in which the tricarboxylic acid anhydride and the diamine are mixed or reacted with each other to give a mixture. The mixture contains unreacted tricarboxylic acid, unreacted tricarboxylic acid anhydride, unreacted diamine, amic acid produced by reacting tricarboxylic acid anhydride and diamine in a molar ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, and furthermore, the amic acid partially or entirely imidized, and the like.
In the process (i), the step in which “the high melting compound maintains its solid states” during the process can be achieved by reacting a liquid low melting compound with a solid high melting compound. Specifically, this step can be achieved by heating the high melting compound at a temperature between less than the melting point of the high melting compound and not lower than the melting point of the low melting compound and adding the low melting compound at an appropriate rate.
The heating temperature is preferably in a temperature range lower by 5 to 10° C. or more than the melting point of the high melting compound, and heating is carried out in a temperature range higher by 5 to 10° C. or more than the melting point of the low melting compound in order to prevent as much as possible the influence on a difference in melting rate caused by heat absorption due to melting, difference in thermal conductivity depending on size and shape, and the like. The specific heating temperature is appropriately selected based on a combination of the high melting compound and the low melting compound based on the above criteria. The “melting point” in the process (i) is also called “a fusing point” and is used in the general meaning of the temperature at which a solid melts. The melting point can be determined by heating a sample filled in a capillary and visually observing the melting point, or by means of a measuring apparatus such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).
In the process (i), when the reaction is carried out at a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the high melting compound, the high melting compound melts, the content becomes a form of a melt or slurry, and after completion of the reaction in the process (ii), a bisimide dicarboxylic acid is obtained in bulk, which is not preferable. On the other hand, when the reaction is carried out at a temperature less than the melting point of the low melting compound, it is not preferable because the high melting compound and the low melting compound do not react. When the mixture is heated in the process (ii), the total amount of the low melting compound simultaneously melts, the content becomes the form of a melt or slurry, and after completion of the reaction, a bisimide dicarboxylic acid is obtained in bulk, which is not preferable.
In order to allow the high melting compound to maintain its solid state, it is preferable to use substantially no solvent or substantially no dispersion medium, and it is more preferable not to use them at all.
The low melting compound is not particularly limited as long as it is in a liquid state with respect to the solid high melting compound at the time of reaction, and may be in a liquid state or a solid state (powdery or particulate state) when added.
While the high melting compound may be heated after the addition of the low melting compound or before the addition of the low melting compound, the latter is more preferable.
The process (i) is preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere.
From the viewpoint of maintaining stably the conditions of being in its solid state of the high melting compound, the addition rate of the low melting compound in the process (i) is preferably from 0.005 to 2.00% by mass/min, more preferably from 0.01 to 1.00% by mass/min. Here, “% by mass/min” means the ratio of the amount of the low melting compound added in 1 minute to the total amount of the low melting compound added eventually.
The process (ii) is a process in which the mixture obtained in the process (i) is reacted to give bisimide dicarboxylic acid. In the process (ii), in order to keep the solid states of the mixture during the process, in addition to the temperature condition of the process (i), the heating temperature may be set to be less than the melting point of the bisimide dicarboxylic acid, which is an intended product, and preferably may be set to be lower by 5 to 10° C. or more than its melting point.
The process (ii) is also preferably carried out under an inert atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere.
The apparatus used in the process (i) is not particularly limited as long as mixing can be carried out at a temperature equal to or higher than the melting point of the low melting compound, and a known polymerization apparatus can be used. When the low melting compound is a liquid at room temperature, an apparatus not equipped with a heating function may be used.
The apparatus used in the process (ii) is not particularly limited as long as mixing can be carried out at a temperature equal to or higher than the temperature in the reaction for removal of water from tricarboxylic acid, and a known polymerization apparatus can be used. Above all, a heating and stirring apparatus with a vent capable of distilling off water of a reaction product is more preferable.
The bisimide dicarboxylic acid obtained by the production method of the present invention can be suitably used as a raw material of polyamide-imide or polyesterimide.
