The endogenous purine nucleoside adenosine is formed ubiquitously and modulates, as important signal molecule, a large number of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Most of it is formed during the intra- and extracellular degradation of adenine nucleotides, and a smaller amount is formed during the intracellular hydrolysis of S-adenosyl homocysteine. Under physiological conditions, extracellular adenosine can be re-phosphorylated by adenosine kinase to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) or rearranged by adenosine deaminase to inosine. The extracellular concentration is between 30 and 300 nM. As a result of tissue damage caused, for example, by hypoxia, in inflammation reaction and during oxidative stress, there is an increased formation and accumulation of adenosine, such that the extracellular concentration may increase to up to 15 μM.
The biological actions of adenosine are mediated via G-protein-coupled receptors located at the plasma membrane. Currently, four adenosine receptor subtypes have been demonstrated: A1 adenosine receptor (A1R), A2a adenosine receptor (A2aR), A2b adenosine receptor (A2bR) and A3 adenosine receptor (A3R). From among the adenosine receptors mentioned above, the A2b receptor has the weakest affinity for adenosine. For this reason, in contrast to the other adenosine receptors, it is not activated under normal physiological conditions. A1 and A3 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins which inhibit adenylate cyclase, whereas A2a and A2b receptors, via Gs proteins, stimulate adenylate cyclase, thus causing an intracellular increase of cAMP. Via Gq proteins, both the A1, the A3 and the A2b receptor activate phospholipase C which cleaves membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol. This in turn leads to an increase of the intracellular calcium concentration and activation of further target proteins such as protein kinase C and the MAP kinases.
A2b receptors are expressed on pulmonary epithelial and smooth muscle cells, vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts and also inflammatory cells. Expression of the A2b receptor at the cell surface is a dynamic process and is greatly enhanced, for example, by hypoxia, inflammatory factors and free radicals. The adenosine-activated A2b receptors lead to formation and release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines such as, for example, IL-6, IL-4 and IL-8. Studies have shown that the A2b receptor plays an important role at the chronic stage of pulmonary disorders during tissue remodelling and promotes inter alia differentiation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts, resulting in enhanced synthesis and deposition of collagen.
In pulmonary tissue samples of patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, COPD and pulmonary hypertension associated with COPD [Zhou et al., PLoS One 5, e9224 (2010); Selmann et al., PLoS One 2, e482 (2007)] and various animal models of fibro-proliferative pulmonary disorders [Karmouty-Quintana et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol., publ. online, 15. July 2013; Karmouty-Quintana et al., Faseb J. 26, 2546-2557 (2012); Sun et al., J. Clin. Invest. 116, 2173-2182 (2006)], it was possible to detect an increased expression of the A2b receptor. In the animal model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension in the mouse, a genetic knock-out of the A2b receptor resulted both in inhibition of the progression of pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary vascular remodeling and the resulting pulmonary hypertension [Karmouty-Quintana et al., Faseb J. 26, 2546-2557 (2012)]. It is assumed that the release of inter alia endothelin-1 (ET-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from vascular cells, which is modulated by the A2b receptor, plays a role during the development of pulmonary hypertension associated with pulmonary fibrosis. Stimulation of human pulmonary arterial endothelial and smooth muscle cells with 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA), an adenosine analogue, results in the release of ET-1 and IL-6, which can be prevented by A2b receptor inhibition [Karmouty-Quintana et al., Faseb J. 26, 2546-2557 (2012)]. Elevated endothelin-1- and IL-6 concentrations were found in lung tissue and serum of patients suffering from pulmonary hypertension [Giaid et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 329, 1967-1968 (1993); Steiner et al., Circ. Res. 104, 236-244 (2009)]. Furthermore, it is assumed that the A2b receptor-mediated release of inter alia IL-6 and other profibrotic mediators and stimulation of the differentiation of fibroblasts in myofibroblasts in the lung leads to induction of fibrosis. Stimulation of human fibroblasts with NECA leads to the release of IL-6 which is increased by hypoxia and can be prevented by inhibiting the A2b receptor. It was possible to demonstrate an increased IL-6 expression in patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis [Zhong et al., Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 32, 2-8 (2005); Cavarra et al., Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 287, L1186-L1192 (2004)].
The A2b receptor also plays an important role in tissue remodelling after myocardial infarction. In the animal model of the permanent ligature of the coronary artery in the mouse, inhibition of the A2b receptor resulted in a reduction of caspase-1 activity and the invasion of inflammatory cells in heart tissue and the cytokines and adhesion molecules in plasma and in an improvement of systolic and diastolic heart function [Toldo et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 343, 587-595 (2012)].
In tumours and surrounding tissue, the local adenosine concentration is frequently greatly elevated as a result of the occurrence of hypoxia, as a result of necrotic processes or else because of genetic and epigenetic changes in tumour cells which lead to elevated extracellular production of adenosine with simultaneously reduced degradation and reduced cellular uptake of adenosine [J. Blay et al., Cancer Res. 57 (13), 2602-2605 (1997); G. Schulte, B. B. Fredholm, Cell Signal. 15 (9), 813-827 (2003)]. This leads to activation of the above-described adenosine receptors in tumour cells, tumour-associated cells and cells in the tissue surrounding the tumour. The signalling chains initiated as a result trigger various kinds of processes, the majority of which promote tumour growth and the spread thereof to other sites in the organism. For that reason, the inhibition of the adenosine signalling pathways constitutes a valuable strategy for treatment of cancer. For example, the inhibition of the A2b receptor-mediated adenosine signalling pathway with the A2b receptor antagonist MRS1754 leads to reduced growth of colon cancer cell lines [D.-F. Ma et al., Hum. Pathol. 41 (11), 1550-1557 (2010)]. The A2b receptor antagonist PSB603 reduces the growth of several prostate cancer cell lines [Q. Wei et al., Purinergic Signal. 9 (2), 271-280 (2013)].
The influence of adenosine on tumour metastases appears to be greater than the direct influence on the proliferation of tumour cells. This involves A2b receptor-mediated adenosine signalling chains in particular, and the blockage of the A2b receptor-both genetically and pharmacologically with A2b receptor antagonists-leads to reduced migration of tumour cells in vitro and reduced formation of metastases in animal models [J. Stagg et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107 (4), 1547-1552 (2010); C. J. Desmet et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 110 (13), 5139-5144 (2013); E. Ntantie et al., Sci. Signal. 6 (277), ra39 (2013)].
Adenosine also affects the tumour-associated vascular endothelium: A2b receptor-mediated adenosine signalling chains lead to release of pro-angiogenic factors from various human tumour cell lines, but also from tumour-associated immune cells, and thus stimulate neovascularization, which promotes tumour growth [S. Ryzhov et al., Neoplasia 10 (9), 987-995 (2008); S. Merighi et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 72 (2), 395-406 (2007); S. Merighi et al., Neoplasia 11 (10), 1064-1073 (2009)].
There is increasingly better understanding of the importance of the immune system in suppression of tumour development, tumour growth and metastasis. It is found in this context that adenosine is capable of reducing the immune reaction [S. Gessi et al., Biochim. Biophys. Acta Biomembranes 1808 (5), 1400-1412 (2011); J. Stagg et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107 (4), 1547-1552 (2010); D. Jin et al., Cancer Res. 70 (6), 2245-2255 (2010); S. F. M. Häiusler et al., Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 60 (10), 1405-1418 (2011); J. Spychala, Pharmacol. Ther. 87 (2-3), 161-173 (2000)]. The inhibition of the A2b receptor-mediated adenosine signalling pathway with the A2b receptor antagonist PSB603, in contrast, leads to a reduction in tumour growth and metastasis in melanoma animal models, which is attributed to inhibition of tumour-induced suppression of the immune system [W. Kaji et al., J. Toxicol. Sci. 39 (2), 191-198 (2014)]. This improvement is caused by a reduction in the proportion of regulatory T cells, which reduce the immune response, in the overall immune cell infiltrate in the presence of the A2b receptor antagonist. At the same time, the populations of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T helper cells are increased. Furthermore, immunosuppressant effects of adenosine on further cells in the immune system have been described (M1 and M2 macrophages, dendritic cells, myeloid suppressor cells), some of which are mediated by the A2b receptor [B. Csoka et al., FASEB J. 26 (1), 376-386 (2012); S. V. Novitskiy et al., Blood 112 (5), 1822-1831 (2008); M. Yang et al., Immunol. Cell Biol. 88 (2), 165-171 (2010); S. Ryzhov et al., J. Immunol. 187 (11), 6120-6129 (2011)]. In animal models of bladder tumours and breast tumours, the A2b receptor antagonist ATL801 brings about slowing of tumour growth and a distinct reduction in metastasis [C. Cekic et al., J. Immunol. 188 (1), 198-205 (2012)]. These effects are accompanied by an ATL801-induced increase in the number of tumour antigen-presenting dendritic cells and a significant increase in the interferon γ level and, as a result, elevated concentrations of chemokine CXCL10, which in turn leads to activation of CXCR3+ T cells and ultimately to improved immune defence against tumour growth and metastasis.
It is therefore assumed that the A2b receptor plays an important role in many disorders, injuries and pathological changes whose aetiology and/or progression is associated with inflammatory events and/or proliferative and fibro-proliferative tissue and vessel remodelling. These can be in particular disorders of and/or damage to the lung, the cardiovascular system or the kidney, or it can be a blood disorder, a neoplastic disease or other inflammatory disorders.
Disorders of and damage to the lung which may be mentioned in this context are in particular idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary hypertension, bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), chronic-obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and cystic fibrosis. Disorders of and damage to the cardiovascular system in which the A2b receptor is involved are, for example, tissue changes following myocardial infarction and associated with heart failure. Renal disorders are, for example, renal insufficiency and kidney failure. A blood disorder is, for example, sickle cell anaemia. Examples of tissue degradation and remodelling during neoplastic processes are the invasion of cancer cells into healthy tissue (formation of metastases) and neovascularization (neoangiogenesis). Another inflammatory disease where the A2b receptor is involved is, for example, multiple sclerosis.
Idiopathic fibrosis of the lung or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease which, left untreated, results in death on average within 2.5 to 3.5 years after diagnosis. At the time of diagnosis, the patients are in most cases more than 60 years old, men being slightly more frequently affected than women. Onset of IPF is insidious and characterized by increasing shortness of breath and dry tickly cough. IPF belongs to the group of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP), a heterogeneous group of pulmonary disorders characterized by fibrosis and inflammation of varying severity which can be distinguished using clinical, imaging and fine tissue criteria. Within this group, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is of particular significance owing to its frequency and aggressive progression [Ley et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 183, 431-440 (2011)]. IPF may either occur sporadically or be hereditary. As yet, the causes are unknown. However, in recent years there have been numerous indications that chronic damage of the alveolar epithelium leads to the release of profibrotic cytokines/mediators followed by increased fibroblast proliferation and increased collagen fibre formation, resulting in a patchy fibrosis and the typical honeycomb structure of the lung [Strieter et al., Chest 136, 1364-1370 (2009)]. The clinical sequelae of fibrotization are a decrease in the elasticity of the pulmonary tissue, a reduced diffusing capacity and the development of severe hypoxia. With regard to lung function, a corresponding worsening of the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the diffusing capacity (DLCO) can be detected. Essential and prognostically important comorbidities of IPF are acute exacerbation and pulmonal hypertension [Beck et al., Pneumologe 10, 105-111 (2013)]. The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in interstitial pulmonary disorders is 10-40% [Lettieri et al., Chest 129, 746-752 (2006); Behr et al., Eur. Respir. J. 31, 1357-1367 (2008)]. Currently, there is no curative treatment for IPF-except for lung transplantation.
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive lung disease which, left untreated, results in death on average within 2.8 years after diagnosis. By definition, the mean pulmonary aterial pressure (mPAP) in case of chronic pulmonary hypertension is >25 mmHg at rest or >30 mmHg during exertion (normal value <20 mmHg). The pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension is characterized by vasoconstriction and remodelling of the pulmonary vessels. In chronic PH, there is a neomuscularization of primarily unmuscularized lung vessels, and the circumference of the vascular musculature of the vessels already muscularized increases. This increasing obliteration of the pulmonary circulation results in progressive stress on the right heart, which leads to a reduced output from the right heart and eventually ends in right heart failure [M. Humbert et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2004, 43, 13S-24S]. Idiopathic (or primary) pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a very rare disorder, whereas secondary pulmonary hypertension (non-PAH PH, NPAHPH) is very common, and it is thought that the latter is currently the third most common group of cardiovascular disorders after coronary heart disease and systemic hypertension [Naeije, in: A. J. Peacock et al. (Eds.), Pulmonary Circulation. Diseases and their treatment, 3rd edition, Hodder Arnold Publ., 2011, S. 3]. Since 2008, pulmonary hypertension is classified in accordance with the Dana Point classification into various sub-groups according to the respective aetiology [D. Montana and G. Simonneau, in: A. J. Peacock et al. (Eds.), Pulmonary Circulation. Diseases and their treatment, 3rd edition, Hodder Arnold Publ., 2011, p. 197-206].
Despite all the advances in the therapy of PH there is as yet no prospect of cure of this serious disorder. Standard therapies available on the market (for example prostacyclin analogues, endothelin receptor antagonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors) are able to improve the quality of life, the exercise tolerance and the prognosis of the patients. These are therapeutic principles which are administered systemically and act primarily haemodynamically by modulating vessel tone. The applicability of these medicaments is limited owing to side effects, some of which are serious, and/or complicated administration forms. The period over which the clinical situation of the patients can be improved or stabilized by specific monotherapy is limited (for example owing to the development of tolerance). Eventually the therapy escalates and thus a combination therapy is applied, where a plurality of medicaments must be given concurrently. Currently, these standard therapeutics are approved only for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). In the case of secondary forms of PH such as PH-COPD, these therapeutic principles (for example sildenafil, bosentan) fail in clinical studies since, as a result of non-selective vasodilatation, they lead to a reduction (desaturation) of the arterial oxygen content in the patients. The probable reason for this is an unfavourable effect on the ventilation-perfusion adaptation in the lung in heterogeneous lung disorders owing to the systemic administration of non-selective vasodilatators [I. Blanco et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2010, 181, 270-278; D. Stolz et al., Eur. Respir. J. 2008, 32, 619-628].
Novel combination therapies are one of the most promising future therapeutic options for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. In this connection, the finding of novel pharmacological mechanisms for the treatment of PH is of particular interest [Ghofrani et al., Herz 2005, 30, 296-302; E. B. Rosenzweig, Expert Opin. Emerging Drugs 2006, 11, 609-619; T. Ito et al., Curr. Med. Chem. 2007, 14, 719-733]. In particular novel therapeutic approaches which can be combined with the therapy concepts already on the market may form the basis of a more efficient treatment and thus be of great advantage for the patients.
In the context of the present invention, the term “pulmonary hypertension” includes both primary and secondary sub-forms (NPAHPH) as defined according to the Dana Point classification in accordance with their respective aetiology [D. Montana and G. Simonneau, in: A. J. Peacock et al. (Eds.), Pulmonary Circulation. Diseases and their treatment, 3' edition, Hodder Arnold Publ., 2011, pp. 197-206; Hoeper et al., J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 2009, 54 (1), Suppl. S, p 85-p 96]. These include in particular in group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), which, among others, embraces the idiopathic and the familial forms (IPAH and FPAH, respectively). Furthermore, PAH also embraces persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and the associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (APAH) associated with collagenoses, congenital systemic pulmonary shunt lesions, portal hypertension, HIV infections, the intake of certain drugs and medicaments (for example of appetite suppressants), with disorders having a significant venous/capillary component such as pulmonary venoocclusive disorder and pulmonary capillary haemangiomatosis, or with other disorders such as disorders of the thyroid, glycogen storage diseases, Gaucher disease, hereditary teleangiectasia, haemoglobinopathies, myeloproliferative disorders and splenectomy. Group 2 of the Dana Point classification comprises PH patients having a causative left heart disorder, such as ventricular, atrial or valvular disorders. Group 3 comprises forms of pulmonary hypertension associated with a lung disorder, for example with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease (ILD), pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and/or hypoxaemia (e.g. sleep apnoe syndrome, alveolar hypoventilation, chronic high-altitude sickness, hereditary deformities). Group 4 includes PH patients having chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disorders, for example in the case of thromboembolic obstruction of proximal and distal pulmonary arteries (CTEPH) or non-thrombotic embolisms (e.g. as a result of tumour disorders, parasites, foreign bodies). Less common forms of pulmonary hypertension, such as in patients suffering from sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X or lymphangiomatosis, are summarized in group 5.
Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) is a chronic rejection reaction after a lung transplant. Within the first five years after a lung transplant about 50-60% of all patients are affected, and within the first nine years more than 90% of patients [Estenne et al., Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 166, 440-444 (2003)]. The cause of the disease has not been elucidated. In spite of numerous improvements in the treatment of transplantation patients, the number of BOS cases has hardly changed over the last years. BOS is the most important long-term complication in lung transplantations and is considered to be the main reason for the fact that survival rates are still markedly below those for other organ transplantations. BOS is an inflammatory event which is associated with changes in the lung tissue affecting primarily the small respiratory passages. Damage and inflammatory changes of the epithelial cells and the subepithelial structures of the smaller respiratory passages lead, owing to ineffective regeneration of the epithelium and aberrant tissue repair, to excessive fibroproliferation. There is scarring and finally destruction of the bronchi and also clots of granulation tissue in the small respiratory passages and alveolae, occasionally with vascular involvement. The diagnosis is based on the lung function. In BOS, there is a worsening of the FEV1 compared to the average of the two best values measured postoperatively. Currently, there is no curative treatment of BOS. Some of the patients show improvements under intensified immunosuppression; patients not showing any response experience persistent deterioration, such that retransplantation is indicated.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressing pulmonary disease characterized by an obstruction of respiratory flow which is caused by pulmonary emphysema and/or chronic bronchitis. The first symptoms of the disease generally manifest themselves during the fourth or fifth decade of life. In the subsequent years of life, shortness of breath frequently becomes worse, and there are instances of coughing combined with copious and purulent sputum, and stenotic respiration extending as far as breathlessness (dyspnoea). COPD is primarily a smokers' disease: smoking is the cause of 90% of all cases of COPD and of 80-90% of all COPD-related deaths. COPD is a big medical problem and constitutes the sixth most frequent cause of death worldwide. Of people over the age of 45, about 4-6% are affected. Although the obstruction of the respiratory flow may only be partial and temporal, COPD cannot be cured. Accordingly, the aim of the treatment is to improve the quality of life, to alleviate the symptoms, to prevent acute worsening and to slow the progressive impairment of lung function. Existing pharmacotherapies, which have hardly changed over the last two or three decades, are the use of bronchodilators to open blocked respiratory passages, and in certain situations corticosteroids to control the inflammation of the lung [P. J. Barnes, N. Engl. J. Med. 343, 269-280 (2000)]. The chronic inflammation of the lung, caused by cigarette smoke or other irritants, is the driving force of the development of the disease. The basic mechanism comprises immune cells which, during the inflammatory reaction of the lung, release proteases and various cytokines which cause pulmonary emphysema and remodelling of the bronchi.
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which act as potent and selective antagonists of the adenosine A2b receptor and are suitable as such for treatment and/or prevention in particular of pulmonary and cardiovascular disorders and of cancer.

Very particular preference is given to combinations of two or more of the abovementioned preferred ranges.
The present invention also encompasses all suitable isotopic variants of the compounds of the invention. An isotopic variant of a compound of the invention is understood here to mean a compound in which at least one atom within the compound of the invention has been exchanged for another atom of the same atomic number, but with a different atomic mass from the atomic mass which usually or predominantly occurs in nature. Examples of isotopes which can be incorporated into a compound of the invention are those of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine, such as 2H (deuterium), 3H (tritium), 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 32P, 33P, 33S, 34S, 35S, 36S, 18F, 36Cl, 82Br, 123I, 124I, 129I and 131I. Particular isotopic variants of a compound of the invention, especially those in which one or more radioactive isotopes have been incorporated, may be beneficial, for example, for the examination of the mechanism of action or of the active ingredient distribution in the body; due to comparatively easy preparability and detectability, especially compounds labelled with 3H or 14C isotopes are suitable for this purpose. In addition, the incorporation of isotopes, for example of deuterium, can lead to particular therapeutic benefits as a consequence of greater metabolic stability of the compound, for example an extension of the half-life in the body or a reduction in the active dose required; such modifications of the compounds of the invention may therefore possibly also constitute a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Isotopic variants of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by commonly used processes known to those skilled in the art, for example by the methods described further down and the procedures described in the working examples, by using corresponding isotopic modifications of the respective reagents and/or starting compounds.
A particular embodiment of such isotopic variants of the compounds of the invention is that of compounds of the formula (I-A)
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00014.TIF </img>
in which the ring A and the R2, R3 and R4 radicals are as defined above,and the salts, solvates and solvates of the salts thereof. The compounds of the formula (I-A) and the use of these compounds for the purposes mentioned in the rest of the description therefore likewise form part of the subject-matter of the present invention.
Furthermore, the present invention also encompasses prodrugs of the compounds of the invention.
The term “prodrugs” refers here to compounds which may themselves be biologically active or inactive, but are converted while present in the body, for example by a metabolic or hydrolytic route, to compounds of the invention.
The inventive compounds of the formula (I) may, depending on the respective nature of the azaheterocycle A, be prepared by different routes, some of which are also alternative routes.
For instance, inventive compounds of the formula (I-1)
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00015.TIF </img>in whichthe ring A1 is an azaheterocycle of the formula

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00017.TIF </img>
In the “one-pot” variant of this process, an alcohol of the formula (1) is converted first with a chlorinating agent, such as preferably thionyl chloride, in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example N,N-diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine, to the corresponding chloro compound [corresponding to formula (3)]. This chloro compound is not isolated but admixed in the same reaction vessel with a solution of the deprotonated azaheterocycle of the formula (2), in order thus to obtain the target compound of the formula (I-1) in one step. Suitable bases for the deprotonation of the heterocycle (2) are strong bases, for example alkali metal hydrides or alkali metal amides; preference is given to using sodium hydride or lithium hexamethyldisilazide. The chlorination step is typically effected in a halogenated hydrocarbon as inert solvent-preference being given here to dichloromethane-in the temperature range around 0° C. The solution of the deprotonated heterocycle (2) is added at the same temperature. The substitution reaction to give (I-1) is then preferably effected at RT. Suitable solvents for preparation of the deprotonated heterocycle (2) are especially N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF) or mixtures thereof. The deprotonation itself is preferably effected within a temperature range between 0° C. and +60° C.
Less hydrolysis-sensitive chloro compounds of the formula (3) can be prepared and also isolated by-similarly to the manner above-reacting alcohols of the formula (1) with a chlorinating agent, such as preferably thionyl chloride, in an inert solvent, for example chloroform or dichloromethane. The reaction is effected here preferably within a temperature range between RT and +80° C., and it has been found to be particularly advantageous for the heating above the boiling point of the particular solvent to use a microwave oven with employment of closed reaction vessels. In a subsequent, separate reaction step, the isolated chloro compounds of the formula (3) are then reacted under similar conditions, as elucidated above, with a solution of the deprotonated heterocycle (2).
In place of the R8 radical in the azaheterocycle of the formula (2) in question, in the process described above, it is first also possible to use a suitable amide protecting group if appropriate or necessary for avoidance of side reactions. Detachment of such a protecting group at the end of the above reaction sequence may be followed by a further derivatization within the scope of definition of R8 via appropriate alkylation or acylation reactions, as familiar to those skilled in the art [with regard to the suitability, introduction and removal of amide protecting groups see, for example, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, 1999].

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00020.TIF </img>
Here, aldehydes of the formula (4) are first converted with hydroxylamine to the corresponding oximes of the formula (5). The reaction is preferably effected at RT using an aqueous hydroxylamine solution in a water-miscible ether such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) as solvent. The subsequent reduction to give the aminomethyl compounds (6) can be effected by hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst. Preferred reaction conditions are hydrogen pressure 1 bar at RT in the presence of a catalytic amount of palladium (10% on charcoal) in methanol or ethanol as solvent. Preferably, the hydrogenation is effected in the presence of aqueous mineral acid, for example concentrated hydrochloric acid. Alternatively, the reduction to the aminomethyl compounds (6) can also be effected with sodium borohydride in the presence of suitable metal salts, for example nickel chloride or cobalt chloride. Preferred reaction conditions here include the use of sodium borohydride in combination with nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate in methanol as solvent at RT. Another route to the aminomethyl compounds of the formula (6) proceeds from the alcohols of the formula (1). These are first converted to the corresponding azides of the formula (8) by reacting them with diphenylphosphoryl azide in the presence of an amine base, for example DBU, at 0° C. to RT in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The reduction of azides (8) to the aminomethyl compounds (6) can then be effected, for example, by reacting with trimethylphosphine in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and concentrated aqueous ammonia at RT.
The aminomethyl compounds of the formula (6) obtained by one of the routes mentioned are then reacted in the last reaction step with aldehydes of the formula (7) in the manner of a reductive amination. A suitable reducing agent here is especially sodium triacetoxyborohydride in the presence of acetic acid. A suitable solvent is 1,2-dichloroethane, and the reaction is preferably effected at RT. The initial step of reductive amination is followed by a spontaneous cyclization reaction which gives the hydroxylactams of the formula (I-2) with release of acetone.

Aldehydes of the formula (4) are first reacted here with 1,2-diaminoethane derivatives of the formula (9) in a reductive amination to give the diamino compounds of the formula (10). A suitable reducing agent is especially sodium cyanoborohydride in the presence of acetic acid. A suitable solvent is methanol, optionally in a mixture with dichloromethane, and the reaction is preferably effected within a temperature range between RT and +70° C.
The target compounds of the formulae (I-3a) and (I-3b) are obtained by subsequent reaction of the diamino compounds (10) with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (11) [for (I-3a)] or N,N'-thiocarbonyldiimidazole (12) [for (I-3b)]. The reactions are preferably effected at RT and in solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,4-dioxane or dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), optionally in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine. The products of the formula (I-3c) are obtained by reaction of the diamino compounds (10) with dimethyl N-cyanodithioiminocarbonate (13). The reaction is preferably effected in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent in the presence of alkali metal carbonates, for example potassium carbonate, as base at elevated temperatures around +80° C. The products of the formula (I-3d) are obtained by reaction of the diamino compounds (10) with methyl (dichloromethylene)carbonate (14). The reaction is preferably effected in dichloromethane as solvent in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine, at RT. Finally, the products of the formula (I-3e) are obtained by reaction of the diamino compounds (10) with diethyl oxalate (15). The reaction is preferably effected in ethanol as solvent at elevated temperatures around +80° C.

The reaction is preferably effected at RT in a solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The subsequent addition of a strong base, for example potassium tert-butoxide, to the reaction mixture at RT then results in the ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-4).

Here, methyl ketones of the formula (70) are first converted with hydroxylamine to the corresponding oximes of the formula (71). The reaction is effected using an aqueous hydroxylamine solution, preferably at elevated temperature, in an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol. The subsequent reduction to give the 1-aminoethyl compounds of the formula (72) is conducted with the aid of sodium borohydride in the presence of a suitable metal salt, for example nickel chloride or cobalt chloride. Preferred reaction conditions include the use of sodium borohydride in combination with nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate in methanol as solvent at RT [cf. also synthesis sequence (4)→(5)→(6) in Scheme 2]. Finally, the 1-aminoethyl compounds of the formula (72) are reacted in a one-pot process first with chloroalkyl isocyanates of the formula (16), at first forming an open-chain urea derivative. The reaction is preferably effected at RT in a solvent mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The subsequent addition of a strong base, for example potassium tert-butoxide, to the reaction mixture at RT then results in the ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-4a) [cf. Scheme 4].

Alcohols of the formula (1) are reacted here with azaheterocycles of the formula (17) in the manner of a Mitsunobu reaction to give the products of the formula (I-5). Suitable reagents for this transformation are, for example, triphenylphosphine, polymer-bound triphenylphosphine, tributylphosphine or trimethylphosphine, each in combination with diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD), diisopropyl diazodicarboxylate (DIAD) or azodicarboxylic acid dipiperidide (ADDP) [cf., for example, D. L. Hughes, Org. Reactions 42, 335 (1992); D. L. Hughes, Org. Prep. Proced. Int. 28 (2), 127 (1996)]. The reaction is preferably conducted in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dichloromethane as solvent within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT.
In place of the R8 radical in the azaheterocycle of the formula (17), in the process described above, it is first also possible to use a suitable amide protecting group if appropriate or necessary for avoidance of side reactions. Detachment of such a protecting group at the end of the above reaction sequence may be followed by a further derivatization within the scope of definition of R8 via appropriate alkylation or acylation reactions, as familiar to those skilled in the art [with regard to the suitability, introduction and removal of amide protecting groups see, for example, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, 1999].

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00036.TIF </img>
Aldehydes of the formula (4) are first heated to reflux here with amino acetals or amino ketals of the formula (18) in a suitable solvent, such as methanol or dichloromethane, in the manner of a reductive amination and then reduced at RT with sodium triacetoxyborohydride to the compounds of the formula (19). These are subsequently converted with potassium cyanate and aqueous perchloric acid in methanol at RT to the urea derivatives of the formula (20). In the last reaction step, the simultaneous acid-catalysed acetal or ketal cleavage and ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-6) are effected. The reaction is effected in methanol at RT with hydrochloric acid of different concentration (from 0.5 mol/l up to concentrated hydrochloric acid).
In the formulae (18), (19) and (20), the dimethyl acetals or dimethyl ketals are shown in each case; however, it is also possible to use other standard acetals and ketals in this process, especially cyclic examples such as 1,3-dioxolane or 1,3-dioxane derivatives.

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00039.TIF </img>
Carboxylic acids of the formula (21) are first converted here in a customary manner, for example by reaction with oxalyl chloride in dichloromethane at RT, in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), to the corresponding acid chlorides (22). Subsequently, in a multistage one-pot method, the open-chain intermediates of the formula (24) are prepared by first converting the acyl chlorides of the formula (22), dissolved in toluene and at RT, with sodium azide to the corresponding carbonyl azides. After filtration to remove inorganic salts, the solutions thus obtained are heated to reflux in toluene, which gives the corresponding isocyanates in the manner of a Curtius rearrangement. The latter are admixed in the last step of the reaction at RT with a solution of an acyl hydrazine of the formula (23) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and thus give the open-chain intermediates of the formula (24). Heating of these intermediates with inorganic bases, for example sodium hydroxide, in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol leads ultimately, through cyclization, to the target compounds of the formula (I-7).

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00042.TIF </img>
Aldehydes of the formula (4) are converted here by reaction with Boc-protected hydrazine in ethanol and in the presence of a catalytic amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid at RT to the hydrazones of the formula (25), which are then converted with sodium cyanoborohydride in methanol at +65° C. to the hydrazine derivatives of the formula (26). The exact control of the pH plays a major role in the latter reaction: in the presence of Bromocresol Green as indicator, addition of acetic acid in portions maintains a pH of about 3-4 over the entire reaction time. The subsequent reaction with the acryloyl chlorides of the formula (27) is conducted under standard conditions, for example in dichloromethane as solvent within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT and in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example N,N-diisopropylethylamine. The final acid-catalysed removal of the Boc protecting group and the subsequent ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-8) are effected at RT either in pure concentrated sulphuric acid or in dichloromethane with an added catalytic amount of concentrated sulphuric acid.
Inventive compounds of the formula (I-9)

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00045.TIF </img>
The aminomethyl compound of the formula (6) described above in Scheme 2 is converted here, in the case that R8 in the target product (I-9) is hydrogen, with a mixture of potassium cyanate and aqueous perchloric acid in methanol at RT or, when R8 is different from hydrogen, with an isocyanate of the formula (65) to the corresponding urea derivative of the formula (66). The isocyanate reaction can be effected in an ethereal solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF) or 1,4-dioxane, optionally with addition of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine; alternatively, the reaction can, for example, also be conducted in pyridine as solvent and as base. The reaction with the isocyanate (65) is generally effected within a temperature range between 0° C. and about +50° C., preferably at RT. Subsequent ring formation to give the target compound (I-9) is achieved by reaction of (66) with an oxalic acid derivative, for example oxalyl chloride or diethyl oxalate. The reaction with oxalyl chloride is preferably conducted in an ethereal solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF) or 1,4-dioxane, or in a halogenated hydrocarbon, for example dichloromethane or 1,2-dichloroethane, or in acetonitrile. The reaction can be effected in the presence of a standard amine base, for example triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or pyridine, and is generally conducted within a temperature range between 0° C. and about +60° C., preferably at 0° C. to RT. The reaction with diethyl oxalate is preferably effected in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol or ethanol, in the presence of sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide as base. The reaction temperature here is in the range between RT and the boiling point of the alcohol in question.
In place of the R8 radical in the isocyanate of the formula (65), in the process described above, it is also possible to use a temporary amide protecting group if appropriate or necessary for avoidance of side reactions. Detachment of such a protecting group at the end of the above reaction sequence may be followed by a further derivatization within the scope of definition of R8 via appropriate alkylation or acylation reactions, as familiar to those skilled in the art [with regard to the suitability, introduction and removal of amide protecting groups see, for example, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, 1999].
Inventive compounds of the formula (I-10)

In this process, the protected hydrazine derivative of the formula (26) (see Scheme 8) is converted first with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane to the free hydrazine of the formula (67). The Boc detachment is effected within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT, preferably at 0° C. In order to avoid breakdown of the product, the reaction time chosen should be no longer than required; in addition, subsequent workup and purifying operations should be conducted at RT. In analogy to a previously described two-stage process [see U.S. Pat. No. 6,077,814, Referential Production Examples 1-4], the hydrazine of the formula (67) is first condensed with glyoxylic acid (68) [R9A═H] under acid catalysis to give the hydrazone of the formula (69). The reaction is effected in water in the presence of hydrochloric acid within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT, preferably at +10° C. to +20° C. Subsequently, the hydrazonocarboxylic acid (69) is converted with diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) to the corresponding carbonyl azide which then gives the corresponding isocyanate in situ in the manner of a Curtius rearrangement, and then the latter cyclizes spontaneously to give the triazolone derivative of the formula (I-10a). The reaction is effected in an inert solvent, for example toluene, and in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine. The reaction is conducted initially within a temperature range between about +40° C. and +80° C.; later on, the reaction temperature is then increased to +100° C. to +110° C.
By using appropriate 2-oxocarboxylic acids (68), it is also possible in principle by this process to obtain those inventive compounds of the formula (I-10a) in which R9A is (C1-C4)-alkyl. In addition, it is possible by downstream reactions in the form of alkylation and acylation reactions as commonly known to those skilled in the art to obtain those inventive compounds of the formula (I-10) in which R8 within the above-specified scope of definition is different from hydrogen.

Compounds of the formula (26) (see Scheme 8) are first reacted here with trimethylsilyl isocyanate to give urea derivatives of the formula (73). The reaction is conducted in an alcohol as solvent, preferably in isopropanol, at elevated temperature, preferably at about 50° C. Under these conditions, there is also simultaneous detachment of the trimethylsilyl group. The ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-11) is achieved by acid-mediated reaction with trimethyl orthoformate. For this purpose, the compounds of the formula (73) are treated in the presence of hydrogen chloride with an excess of trimethyl orthoformate in methanol. The reaction is preferably conducted at room temperature.

<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00054.TIF </img>
The aminomethyl compounds of the formula (6) (see Scheme 2) are first reacted here with chloroacetyl chloride (74) to give α-chloro amides of the formula (75). The reaction is effected in an inert solvent, for example and with preference dichloromethane, in the presence of a customary tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine, within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT. The compounds of the formula (75) are then reacted with ammonia or a primary amine of the formula (76) to give α-amino amides of the formula (77). This reaction is effected either with concentrated aqueous ammonia or the corresponding primary amine (76) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide at a temperature of about +50° C. The α-amino amides (77) are then reacted again with chloroacetyl chloride (74) under the same conditions as described above to give α-chloro amides of the formula (78). The subsequent ring closure to give the target compounds of the formula (I-12) is achieved with the aid of a strong base, for example potassium tert-butoxide, in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide. The reaction is conducted in an ethereal solvent, for example and with preference tetrahydrofuran (THF), at RT.
Further examples of the inventive compounds of formula (I) having substitution on the azaheterocycle A can be obtained in an analogous manner by using correspondingly substituted starting compounds in the above-described processes of Schemes 1-12. Any hydroxyl, amino and/or amido groups present in such starting compounds can, if appropriate or necessary, also be used in temporarily protected form and then released again at the end of the particular reaction sequence [with regard to the suitability, introduction and removal of such protecting groups see, for example, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, New York, 1999].
The synthesis of the thienouracil intermediates of the formulae (1), (4), (21) and (70) used for the preparation of the compounds of the invention [see Schemes 1-12] is shown in the following Reaction Schemes 13-21:
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00055.TIF </img>
2-Aminothiophene-3-carboxylic esters of the formula (29) are converted here to the ureas of the formula (32) either with isocyanates of the formula (30) or, after activation with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), by reaction with amines of the formula (31). The reaction with the isocyanates (30) is preferably effected in an ethereal solvent, for example in tetrahydrofuran (THF), and in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine, under reflux conditions, or in pure pyridine as solvent and base at a temperature of about +50° C. The activation of the 2-aminothiophene-3-carboxylic ester (29) with CDI is likewise conducted in the presence of a tertiary amine base, for example triethylamine, in an inert solvent, preferably in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dichloromethane, at RT and sometimes takes prolonged reaction times of several days. After addition of the amine component (31) to the CDI-activated 2-aminothiophene-3-carboxylic ester, there is generally rapid further reaction at RT to give the ureas of the formula (32). Subsequent treatment with alkali metal alkoxides in the corresponding alcohol as solvent (for example and with preference sodium ethoxide in ethanol) achieves ring closure to give the thienouracils of the formula (33) in a clean reaction. Depending on the substituent R3, the reaction already proceeds at RT, or it requires a somewhat elevated temperature around +50° C.
The subsequent alkylation with the compounds of the formula (34) is conducted in the presence of an inorganic base, for example potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate, in an inert solvent, for example and with preference N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile or mixtures thereof. The reaction temperature is typically between RT and about +100° C. In the case of volatile alkylating agents (34), it is found to be helpful to use closed reaction vessels and heating by means of a microwave oven. Depending on the nature of the leaving group Y, it may be advantageous to conduct the alkylation in the presence of a catalytic amount of potassium iodide. The compounds of the formula (35) thus obtained are then converted in a Vilsmeier-Haack reaction with a mixture of phosphorus oxychloride and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in an exothermic reaction to the aldehydes of the formula (4). Typically, the heat released during the reaction is sufficient to achieve full conversion. Sometimes, however, it may also be necessary to heat the mixture to about +90° C. for a while after the heat of reaction has abated.
The above reaction sequence of alkylation and formylation can also be conducted in the reverse sequence, by first converting the thienouracils of the formula (33) under the conditions of the Vilsmeier-Haack reaction already described to the formyl derivatives of the formula (36) and then alkylating the latter under the conditions likewise already described with the compounds of the formula (34) to give the target aldehydes of the formula (4).

It is possible to obtain the thienouracil tert-butyl esters of the formula (40) from 5-aminothiophene-2,4-dicarboxylic esters of the formula (37) in an entirely analogous manner to the reactions described in Scheme 13 for the preparation of the intermediates (32), (33) and (35). Subsequent treatment of the tert-butyl esters (40) at RT with either trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane or a solution of hydrogen chloride in 1,4-dioxane gives the carboxylic acids of the formula (41). These can either be converted to the alcohols of the formula (1) directly by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride at about 0° C. in an inert solvent, for example and with preference tetrahydrofuran (THF), or after prior conversion to the corresponding methyl esters of the formula (42). The latter can be obtained in a one-pot process by first converting the carboxylic acids of the formula (41) with oxalyl chloride in dichloromethane at RT and in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to the corresponding acid chlorides, which then, methyl esters of the formula (42) by quenching with methanol.
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00057.TIF </img>
It is possible to obtain the thienouracil ethyl esters of the formula (46) from diethyl 5-aminothiophene-2,4-dicarboxylates of the formula (43), likewise in an entirely analogous manner to the reactions described in Scheme 13 for the preparation of the intermediates (32), (33) and (35). The subsequent reduction with a complex metal hydride, for example and with preference lithium aluminium hydride, then gives the alcohols of the formula (1) in a similar manner to that described above in Scheme 14. The reaction is effected typically in a temperature range between −40° C. and 0° C. in an inert solvent, for example and with preference tetrahydrofuran (THF).
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00058.TIF </img>
Analogously to the process described in Scheme 14 [compound (37) to compound (40)], it is possible to prepare the N3-protected thienouracil tert-butyl esters of the formula (50) from 5-aminothiophene-2,4-dicarboxylic esters of the formula (37) and 2,4-dimethoxybenzylamine (47). In the subsequent treatment with aluminium trichloride, which is effected in toluene at about +65° C., simultaneous detachment of the 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl protecting group and the tert-butyl ester affords the carboxylic acids of the formula (51). These are subsequently converted in a double N,O alkylation with the compounds of the formula (52) to give the compounds of the formula (53). This alkylation is conducted under the same conditions as already described for the alkylation steps in the preceding synthesis schemes (see, for example, Scheme 13). The final reduction with a complex metal hydride, for example and with preference lithium aluminium hydride, then gives the target alcohols of the formula (1). The reaction is effected typically within a temperature range between −40° C. and RT in an inert solvent, for example and with preference tetrahydrofuran (THF).

The aldehydes of the formula (4) and alcohols of the formula (1) obtained by one of the above-described processes can, if it seems desirable for synthesis purposes, be interconverted by several methods that are familiar to those skilled in the art. For example, the alcohols of the formula (1) can be oxidized with manganese dioxide in dichloromethane at RT to the aldehydes of the formula (4). Conversely, the aldehydes of the formula (4) can be reduced with complex hydrides, for example lithium aluminium hydride or sodium borohydride, to the alcohols of the formula (1). The reduction with lithium aluminium hydride is preferably effected in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at −78° C., whereas the reduction with sodium borohydride can be effected, for example, in ethanol at RT.

The thienouracil intermediates of the formula (21) can be obtained from the thienouracils of the formula (35), the preparation of which is described in Scheme 13, by first converting the compounds of the formula (35) with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), N-iodosuccinimide (NIS) or N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) to the corresponding halides of the formula (54) (here: halogen=bromine). The reaction is preferably effected in chloroform within a temperature range between 0° C. and RT. Subsequent Negishi coupling with the zinc organyl (55) affords the tert-butyl ester derivatives of the formula (56). The coupling reaction is preferably conducted in an ethereal solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF), at a temperature of about +60° C. A multitude of homogeneous palladium(0) catalysts in combination with various phosphine ligands are suitable for this reaction; preference is given to using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) in conjunction with 1,2,3,4,5-pentaphenyl-1'-(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene (Q-Phos). The subsequent cleavage of the tert-butyl ester moiety, for example with trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane at RT, gives the target carboxylic acids of the formula (21) in a clean reaction.
6-Acetylthienouracils of the formula (70) (see Scheme 4a) can be obtained in a simple manner by the method shown in Scheme 19:
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00061.TIF </img>
Thienouracilcarboxylic acids of the formula (41) (see Scheme 14) are first converted here to Weinreb amides of the formula (79). For this purpose, the carboxylic acids (41) are reacted with a chlorinating agent, for example oxalyl chloride, in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF, to give the corresponding acid chlorides which then react with N, O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride to give the amides of the formula (79). The first step of the reaction is preferably effected in dichloromethane at RT. The amide formation in the second step is effected at RT in an ethereal solvent, such as preferably tetrahydrofuran (THF), in the presence of a customary tertiary amine base, such as preferably N,N-diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine. The conversion to the methyl ketones of the formula (70) is then achieved by reaction with a methyl-metal compound. Preference is given to using methylmagnesium chloride or bromide for this purpose. The reaction is effected in inert solvents, such as preferably tetrahydrofuran (THF), at low temperature, preferably within the temperature range between −78° C. and 0° C.
Alkyl-substituted 5-aminothiophene-2,4-dicarboxylic esters such as the compounds of the formulae (37) and (43) [Schemes 14-16, with R2=methyl or ethyl] can be obtained by a known process via the 3-component reaction of an acetoacetic or 3-ketovaleric ester with an α-cyanoacetic ester and elemental sulphur [“Gewald reaction”; see, for example, B. P. McKibben et al., Tetrahedron Lett. 40, 5471-5474 (1999) and further literature cited therein].
Thienouracil intermediates of the formula (1) in which R2 is difluoromethyl or trifluoromethyl are also obtainable in an advantageous manner by the process shown in Scheme 20 via the betaine compound (62):
<img> id-US20180065981A1-20180308-C00062.TIF </img>
The process begins with a base-induced condensation of the malonic ester (57) with the urea derivative (58) to give the barbituric acid derivative of the formula (59). The condensation is typically effected with the aid of an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium ethoxide or sodium tert-butoxide or potassium tert-butoxide in the alcohol in question as solvent or with the aid of an alkali metal hydride such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride, in tetrahydrofuran or N,N-dimethylformamide as inert solvent; preference is given to using sodium ethoxide in ethanol. The reaction is generally conducted within a temperature range of +20° C. to +100° C. The conversion of the compound (59) to the 6-chloropyrimidinedione (60) is effected by treatment with excess phosphorus oxychloride in an aqueous alcohol such as methanol or ethanol as solvent within a temperature range of 0° C. to +100° C. The subsequent conversion to the pyridinium enolate betaine (62) is conducted analogously to a method described in the literature for synthesis of 3-substituted chromone derivatives [I. Yokoe et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 42 (8), 1697-1699 (1994)] by reacting the 6-chloropyrimidinedione (60) with the anhydride (61) in the presence of a relatively large excess of pyridine (about ten-fold). The reaction is generally effected within a temperature range of 0° C. to +40° C., and the inert solvent used is preferably acetonitrile. Bases suitable for the subsequent condensation of the betaine (62) with the mercaptoacetic ester (63) to give the thienouracils of the formula (45a) are especially alkali metal carbonates such as lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or caesium carbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium methoxide or potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide or potassium ethoxide or sodium tert-butoxide or potassium tert-butoxide, or alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride or potassium hydride; preference is given to using sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate [cf. also K. Hirota et al., J. Heterocycl. Chem. 27 (3), 717-721 (1990)]. The reaction is preferably conducted in an alcoholic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or tert-butanol, or in an inert polar-aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP) or N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), within a temperature range of +20° C. to +150° C., and it has been found to be advantageous to run the reaction under microwave irradiation. The solvent used is preferably ethanol.
The alkylation of the compounds of the formula (45a) with the compounds of the formula (34) is effected analogously to the alkylation reactions already described in Scheme 13 and affords the ethyl esters of the formula (46a) which are converted in a final reduction with a complex metal hydride, for example lithium aluminium hydride, to the alcohols of the formula (1a). The reduction is typically conducted in an ethereal solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran (THF), and is generally effected within a temperature range of −40° C. to 0° C.
Thienouracil intermediates of the formula (1) in which R2 is hydrogen can also be obtained by the process shown in Scheme 21:

In this process, the barbituric acid derivative of the formula (59) (see Scheme 20) is first converted with a mixture of phosphorus oxychloride and N,N-dimethylformamide to a compound of the formula (64) and the latter is then condensed in the presence of a base with the mercaptoacetic ester (63) to give the thienouracil of the formula (45b). The conversion of the compound (59) to the 6-chloro-5-formylpyrimidinedione (64) is effected via a regioselective Vilsmeier-Haack reaction by treatment with a preformed mixture of phosphorus oxychloride and N,N-dimethylformamide which is used in a large excess and simultaneously also serves as solvent [cf., for example, K. Tanaka et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 35 (4), 1397-1404 (1987)]. The reaction is generally effected within a temperature range of +20° C. to +120° C. The subsequent reactions-the condensation to give the thienouracils of the formula (45b), the alkylation to give the compounds of the formula (46b) and the reduction to give the alcohols of the formula (1b)-are conducted analogously to the conditions as already described in Scheme 20.

The present invention further provides medicaments which comprise at least one compound of the invention, typically together with one or more inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients, and for the use thereof for the aforementioned purposes.
The compounds of the invention can act systemically and/or locally. For this purpose, they can be administered in a suitable manner, for example by the oral, parenteral, pulmonal, nasal, sublingual, lingual, buccal, rectal, dermal, transdermal, conjunctival or otic route, or as an implant or stent.
The compounds of the invention can be administered in administration forms suitable for these administration routes.
Suitable administration forms for oral administration are those which work according to the prior art and release the compounds of the invention rapidly and/or in a modified manner and which contain the compounds of the invention in crystalline and/or amorphized and/or dissolved form, for example tablets (uncoated or coated tablets, for example with gastric juice-resistant or retarded-dissolution or insoluble coatings which control the release of the compound of the invention), tablets or films/oblates which disintegrate rapidly in the oral cavity, films/lyophilizates, capsules (for example hard or soft gelatin capsules), sugar-coated tablets, granules, pellets, powders, emulsions, suspensions, aerosols or solutions.
Parenteral administration can bypass an absorption step (e.g. intravenously, intraarterially, intracardially, intraspinally or intralumbally) or include an absorption (e.g. inhalatively, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intracutaneously, percutaneously or intraperitoneally). Administration forms suitable for parenteral administration include preparations for injection and infusion in the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilisates or sterile powders.
For the other administration routes, suitable examples are inhalable medicament forms (including powder inhalers, nebulizers, metered aerosols), nasal drops, solutions or sprays, tablets, films/oblates or capsules for lingual, sublingual or buccal administration, suppositories, ear or eye preparations, vaginal capsules, aqueous suspensions (lotions, shaking mixtures), lipophilic suspensions, ointments, creams, transdermal therapeutic systems (e.g. patches), milk, pastes, foams, sprinkling powders, implants or stents.
Oral and parenteral administration are preferred, especially oral, intravenous and intrapulmonary (inhalative) administration.
The compounds of the invention can be converted to the administration forms mentioned. This can be accomplished in a manner known per se by mixing with inert, nontoxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients. These excipients include carriers (for example microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, mannitol), solvents (e.g. liquid polyethylene glycols), emulsifiers and dispersing or wetting agents (for example sodium dodecylsulphate, polyoxysorbitan oleate), binders (for example polyvinylpyrrolidone), synthetic and natural polymers (for example albumin), stabilizers (e.g. antioxidants, for example ascorbic acid), colorants (e.g. inorganic pigments, for example iron oxides) and flavour and/or odour correctants.
In general, it has been found to be advantageous in the case of parenteral administration to administer amounts of about 0.001 to 1 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 0.5 mg/kg, of body weight to achieve effective results. In the case of oral administration the dosage is about 0.01 to 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.01 to 20 mg/kg and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg/kg of body weight. In the case of intrapulmonary administration, the amount is generally about 0.1 to 50 mg per inhalation.
It may nevertheless be necessary in some cases to deviate from the stated amounts, specifically as a function of the body weight, route of administration, individual response to the active ingredient, nature of the preparation and time or interval over which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases less than the abovementioned minimum amount may be sufficient, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned must be exceeded. In the case of administration of greater amounts, it may be advisable to divide them into several individual doses over the day.
The working examples which follow illustrate the invention. The invention is not restricted to the examples.

Further Details:
The descriptions of the coupling patterns of 1H NMR signals which follow are guided by the visual appearance of the signals in question and do not necessarily correspond to a strict, physically correct interpretation. In general, the stated chemical shift refers to the centre of the signal in question; in the case of broad multiplets, an interval is generally given.
Melting points and melting-point ranges, if stated, are uncorrected.
In cases where the reaction products were obtained by trituration, stirring or recrystallization, it was frequently possible to isolate further amounts of product from the respective mother liquor by chromatography. However, a description of this chromatography is dispensed with hereinbelow unless a large part of the total yield could only be isolated in this step.
All reactants or reagents whose preparation is not described explicitly hereinafter were purchased commercially from generally accessible sources. For all other reactants or reagents whose preparation is likewise not described hereinafter and which were not commercially obtainable or were obtained from sources which are not generally accessible, a reference is given to the published literature in which their preparation is described.
In the case of the synthesis intermediates and working examples of the invention described hereinafter, any compound specified in the form of a salt of the corresponding base or acid is generally a salt of unknown exact stoichiometric composition, as obtained by the respective preparation and/or purification process. Unless specified in more detail, additions to names and structural formulae, for example “hydrochloride”, “formate”, “acetate”, “trifluoroacetate”, “sodium salt” or “x HCl”, “x HCOOH”, “x CH3COOH”, “x CF3COOH”, “x Na” should therefore not be understood in a stoichiometric sense in the case of such salts, but are merely of descriptive character with regard to the salt-forming components present.

11.4 ml (123 mmol) of phosphorus oxychloride were added cautiously to a solution of 6.90 g (30.8 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 43A in 28.4 ml (369 mmol) of DMF. After the strongly exothermic reaction had subsided, the mixture was stirred at RT for another 60 min. Since reactant was still detectable by HPLC analysis, the reaction mixture was heated to 90° C. for a further 30 min. Then the reaction mixture was stirred cautiously into 300 ml of water at RT, and the product precipitated out. The heterogeneous mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h, then the product was filtered off with suction, washed to neutrality with water and dried. The crude product thus obtained was stirred with 30 ml acetonitrile at RT. The solids were filtered off with suction and gave a first fraction of the title compound. The mother liquor from the stirring was concentrated to about 10 ml and then 30 ml of pentane were added. This precipitated a second fraction of the product, which was filtered off with suction and combined with the first. A total of 7.25 g (93% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.

25.0 g (284 mmol) of ethylurea and 43 ml (284 mmol) of diethyl malonate were dissolved in 150 ml of ethanol, and 106 ml (284 mmol) of a 20% solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol were added. The mixture was heated under reflux for 1 h, resulting in the formation of a precipitate. After cooling to RT, the precipitate was separated off and the filtrate was freed from most of the solvent on a rotary evaporator. About 500 ml of water were added to the remaining residue, and the mixture was acidified with 5 M hydrochloric acid to pH 3-4. The aqueous solution was then extracted three times with about 100 ml of ethyl acetate each time. Drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtration and evaporation of the combined organic extracts gave a first fraction of the title compound (14.1 g, 31% of theory). The aqueous phase left earlier was concentrated to a volume of about 250 ml and adjusted to pH 1 with 5 M hydrochloric acid, and solid sodium chloride was added to saturation. The mixture was once more extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase was dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. At RT, the product obtained in this manner was stirred with 200 ml of diethyl ether. The mixture was then filtered and the residue was dried under high vacuum. This gave a second fraction of the title compound (6.0 g, 13% of theory). A total of 20.1 g (45% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.

Method A:
To a solution of 99 mg (1.15 mmol) of imidazolidin-2-one in 3 ml of THF were added 46 mg (1.15 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% suspension in mineral oil), and the mixture was heated to 60° C. for 2 h and subsequently cooled back down to RT (“Solution 1”). To a solution of 90 mg (0.287 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 143A in 2 ml of dichloromethane in another reaction vessel were added, at 0° C., 100 μl (0.573 mmol) of N,N-diisopropylethylamine and 22 μl (0.301 mmol) of thionyl chloride. After 20 min at 0° C., Solution 1 was added dropwise and then the cooling bath was removed. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h. Then all the volatile constituents were removed on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was separated into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 63 mg (60% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
Method B:
To a solution of 45.95 g (135 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 220A and 28.2 ml (202 mmol) of triethylamine in 1.12 litres of THF were added 26.26 g (162 mmol) of CDI, and the mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h. Subsequently, the mixture was concentrated to dryness. The remaining residue was taken up in 1.5 litres of ethyl acetate and washed successively with 1 M hydrochloric acid, water, saturated sodium carbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, the mixture was filtered and concentrated. In this way, a first fraction of 37.5 g of the crude product was obtained. The combined aqueous phases were extracted once again with ethyl acetate. After concentration of the organic extract, a second fraction of 9.5 g of the crude product was obtained. The first crude product fraction was suspended in 200 ml of ethyl acetate and stirred at RT for 5 min, before 100 ml of cyclohexane were added. After the heterogeneous mixture had been stirred at RT overnight, the solids were filtered off with suction and dried under high vacuum. This gave a first pure fraction of the title compound (19.62 g). The same procedure was followed with the second crude product fraction, using 100 ml of ethyl acetate and 50 ml of cyclohexane. This gave the second pure fraction of the title compound (2.75 g). The ethyl acetate/cyclohexane filtrates obtained above were combined and concentrated to dryness. The remaining residue (17.64 g) was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 15). Concentration of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum gave a third pure product fraction (5.02 g). A total of 27.39 g (55% of theory) of the title compound were thus obtained.
Method C:
1.43 g (4.25 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 201A were dissolved in methanol and passed through a hydrogencarbonate cartridge (from Polymerlabs, Stratospheres SPE, PL-HCO3 MP SPE). After concentration of the solution, 1.25 g of the free amine (compound from Ex. 200A) were obtained. The amine was dissolved in a mixture of 29 ml of DMF and 14 ml of THF, and 380 μl (4.46 mmol) of 2-chloroethyl isocyanate were added. After stirring for 2 h, 715 mg (6.37 mmol) of potassium tert-butoxide were added to the reaction mixture. After a further 30 min, the mixture was diluted with n-hexane and washed successively with saturated sodium hydrogencarbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. This gave a first fraction of the crude product. The combined aqueous phases were extracted once again with ethyl acetate. Drying of the extract over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtration and concentration gave a second crude product fraction. The crude products were purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After combination of the product fractions and drying under high vacuum, 514 mg (31% of theory, 95% purity) of the title compound were obtained.
Crystallization of the Title Compound:
6.5 g of the title compound were admixed with 135 ml of water/ethanol (95:5) and heated until commencement of reflux. Once everything had gone into solution, the oil bath temperature was turned down to 70° C. At this time, the compound began to precipitate out. The mixture was stirred gently at 70° C. overnight. The next morning, the oil bath temperature was turned down to 50° C. and the mixture was stirred at this temperature for 3 h. Then the heating was switched off and the mixture was allowed to come gradually to RT in the oil bath while stirring. After about 4 h, RT had been attained, and the mixture was then left to stand at RT without stirring for a further 2.5 days. The compound was then filtered off with suction, washed with a little water/ethanol (95:5) and then dried at 4 mbar and 50° C. In this way, 6.02 g (93% of theory) of the title compound were obtained as a white crystalline solid. Melting point: 165-167° C.

To a solution of 10 mg (0.023 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 523A in 150 μl of ethanol were added 6 μl (0.016 mmol) of a 21% solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol. After stirring at RT for 1 h, the temperature was increased to 60° C. After 4 h at this temperature, a further 150 μl of ethanol and 6 μl (0.016 mmol) of the 21% solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol were added. After a further 2 h at 60° C., the reaction mixture was cooled down to RT, diluted with a little DMSO and separated directly into its components by means of preparative HPLC (Method 8). After concentration of the product fraction and drying under high vacuum, 0.5 mg (5% of theory) of the title compound was obtained.

B. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMACOLOGICAL EFFICACY
The pharmacological activity of the inventive compounds can be demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies, as known to the person skilled in the art. The application examples which follow describe the biological action of the inventive compounds, without restricting the invention to these examples.
B-1. Cellular In Vitro Tests for Determining A2b Receptor Activity and Adenosine Receptor Selectivity
The identification of selective antagonists of the human adenosine A2b receptor and the quantification of the efficacy and selectivity of the compounds according to the invention was carried out with the aid of recombinant cell lines for the human adenosine receptors A1, A2a, A2b and A3. These cell lines were originally derived from an ovarepithelial cell of the hamster (Chinese Hamster Ovary, CHO-K1, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va. 20108, USA). In addition to the respective recombinantly expressed adenosine receptor for testing the efficacy at the A1, A2a and A2b receptors, the cell lines contain a reporter gene construct where expression of the firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase is under the control of a promoter which can be activated via intracellular signal cascades by stimulation of the receptors with the (not subtype-selective) adenosine receptor agonist NECA (5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) [S. J. Hill, J. G. Baker, S. Rhees, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 1, 526-532 (2001)].
In the case of the A2a and A2b cell lines, this is a minimal promoter having a plurality of cAMP-responsive elements (CRE). Stimulation of the Gs-coupled A2b or A2a receptors by NECA ultimately leads, via formation of cAMP, to CRE-dependent induction of luciferase expression, which is detected 3 hours after the start of the incubation with NECA using a detection solution in a suitable luminometer. For testing the antagonists, initially, in a pre-experiment, the concentration of NECA which, at the test day in question, results in half-maximum stimulation of luciferase expression (EC50 concentration) is determined. By joint incubation of this EC50 concentration of NECA with the substances to be tested, it is possible to determine their antagonistic activity.
The cell line for testing the Gi-coupled A1 receptor contains a different reporter gene construct where expression of the firefly luciferase is under the control of an NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) promoter. This cell line was, in addition to the A1 receptor and the NFAT reporter gene, also stably transfected with a further gene coding for the promiscuous Gα16 protein [T. T. Amatruda, D. A. Steele, V. Z. Slepak, M. I. Simon, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 5587-5591 (1991)], either independently or as a fusion gene. The resulting test cells react to stimulation of the usually Gi-coupled A1 receptor with an increased intracellular calcium concentration which then leads to a NFAT-dependent luciferase expression. The procedure of the experiment for testing the antagonists at the A1 receptor corresponds to the procedure for testing with the A2a and A2b cell lines.
During generation of the A3 receptor cell line, co-transfection of the A3 receptor and the promiscuous Gα16 protein were also carried out so that here, too, stimulation of the receptor leads to an increased intracellular calcium concentration. However, in the A3 receptor test, this increase in calcium is measured directly via the calcium-sensitive photoprotein Photina® [S. Bovolenta, M. Foti, S. Lohmer, S. Corazza, J. Biomol. Screen. 12, 694-704 (2007)]. After determination of the EC50 concentration of NECA, the effects of the substance were measured after 5-10 minutes of pre-incubation with substance by addition of this EC50 concentration in measuring position in a suitable luminometer capable of dispensing.
The IC50 values from the A2b receptor assay for individual working examples are given in Table 1 below (in some cases as means of a plurality of independent individual determinations and rounded to two significant figures):

B-2. Adenosine Receptor Binding Assays
The binding properties of the test compounds on adenosine receptors were determined in binding studies with radioligands. For this purpose, membrane preparations of the human adenosine receptor subtypes were produced from cell lines having recombinant receptor expression (CHO cells for the A1 receptor, HEK293 cells for the A2a, A2b and A3 receptors). The following radioligands were used in the experiments: [3H]-DPCPX for the A1 receptor, [3H]-CGS 21680 for the A2a receptor, [3H]-CPX for the A2b receptor and [125I]-AB-MECA for the A3 receptor. The test substances were each tested in 8 different concentrations and 2 repeat tests per concentration. The displacement of the particular radioligand by the test compound was expressed as percentage inhibition of the specific binding of the controls. The IC50 values (concentration which brings about half-maximum inhibition of the specific binding of the controls) and the Hill coefficients (nH) were determined by a non-linear regression analysis, using the competition curves obtained from the mean values of the repeat tests and conducting a curve fit according to the Hill equation:
<in-line-formulae>Y=D+[A−D/1+(C/C50)nH]</in-line-formulae>
(Y=specific binding; A=left-hand asymptote of the curve; D=right-hand asymptote of the curve; C=substance concentration; C50=IC50; nH=rise factor).
The inhibition constant (Ki) was calculated by the Cheng-Prusoff equation:
<in-line-formulae>Ki=IC50/(1+L/KD)</in-line-formulae>
(L=concentration of the radioligand in the assay; KD=receptor affinity of the radioligand for the receptor, determined with a Scatchard plot).[Literature: A1 receptor: Townsend-Nicholson, A. and Schofield, P. R., J. Biol. Chem. 269: 2373-2376 (1994); A2a receptor: Luthin, D. R. et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 47: 307-313 (1995); A2b receptor: Stehle, J. H. et al., Mol.

B-3. Measurement of NECA-Induced IL-6 Release by LL29 Fibroblasts
Stimulation of fibroblasts with adenosine or the adenosine analog 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) leads to release of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokine IL-6 which can be prevented by inhibition of the A2b receptor.
Accordingly, confluent cells of the human fibroblast cell line LL29 were treated with the test substances and stimulated with NECA (10 μM). After an incubation time of 24 hours, the cell supernatant is removed and human IL-6 in the cell supernatant is determined by ELISA (Quantikine® IL6 ELISA, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, USA).
Table 3 below lists the IC50 values obtained in this way for inhibition of IL-6 release for some working examples:

B-4. Animal Model of Monocrotaline-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension
Monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension of the rat is a widely used animal model of pulmonary hypertension. The pyrrolizidine alkaloid monocrotaline is, after subcutaneous injection, metabolized in the liver to the toxic monocrotalinepyrrole, and within a few days endothelium injury in the pulmonary circulation results, followed by remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries (mediahypertrophy, de novo muscularization). A single subcutaneous injection suffices to induce pronounced pulmonary hypertension in rats within 4 weeks [Cowan et al., Nature Med. 6, 698-702 (2000)].
Male Sprague-Dawley rats are used for the model. On day 0, the animals receive a subcutaneous injection of 60 mg of monocrotaline/kg. Treatment of the animals with the test substance (by gavage, by addition to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation) starts 14 days after the monocrotaline injection at the earliest and extends over a period of at least 14 days. At the end of the study, the animals are examined haemodynamically. For the haemodynamic measurement, the rats are initially anaesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The animals are then tracheotomized and artificially ventilated (frequency: 60 breaths/min; ratio inspiration to expiration: 50:50; positive end-expiratory pressure: 1 cm H2O; tidal volume: 10 ml/kg of body weight; FIO2: 0.5). Anaesthesia is maintained by inhalative isofluran anaesthesia. The systemic blood pressure is determined in the left carotid artery using a Millar microtip catheter. A polyethylene catheter is advanced via the right jugular vein into the right ventricle to determine the right-ventricular pressure. Following the haemodynamic measurements, the heart is removed, the ratio of right to left ventricle including septum is determined and the tissue is deep-frozen for expression analyses. The lung is likewise removed, the left half of the lung is fixed in formalin for histopathological examination and the right half of the lung is deep-frozen for expression analyses. Furthermore, plasma samples are obtained to determine biomarkers (for example proBNP) and plasma substance concentrations.
B-5. Animal Model of SU5416/Hypoxia-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension
SU5416/hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension of the rat is a widely used animal model of pulmonary hypertension. By injection of the VEGF receptor antagonist SU5416 in combination with hypoxia, the effect of the reduced oxygen content may be enhanced, leading to changes in the endothelium in the form of plexiform lesions. A single subcutaneous injection, generally of 20 mg/kg, is, in combination with hypoxia, i.e. increased vascular shear forces by vasoconstriction, sufficient to induce severe pulmonary hypertension [Oka et al., Circ. Res. 100, 923-929 (2007)].
Male Sprague-Dawley rats or Dahl-Salz rats are used for the model. On day 0, the animals receive a subcutaneous injection of SU5416 and are kept in a controlled hypoxic atmosphere (10% oxygen). Corresponding control rats receive an injection of vehicle and are kept under normoxic conditions. Chronic hypoxia of at least 14 days with subsequent normoxia of at least 28 days leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension which can be demonstrated both functionally and morphologically. Treatment of the animals with the test substance (by gavage, by addition to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation) starts 14 days after the SU5416 injection and at the beginning of the animals being kept in a controlled hypoxic atmosphere at the earliest and extends over a period of at least 14-28 days.
At the end of the study, the animals are examined haemodynamically. For the haemodynamic measurement, the rats are initially anaesthetized with pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). The animals are then tracheotomized and artificially ventilated (frequency: 60 breaths/min; ratio inspiration to expiration: 50:50; positive end-expiratory pressure: 1 cm H2O; tidal volume: 10 ml/kg of body weight; FIO2: 0.5). Anaesthesia is maintained by inhalative isofluran anaesthesia. The systemic blood pressure is determined in the left carotid artery using a Millar microtip catheter. A polyethylene catheter is advanced via the right jugular vein into the right ventricle to determine the right-ventricular pressure. Following the haemodynamic measurements, the heart is removed, the ratio of right to left ventricle including septum is determined and the tissue is deep-frozen for expression analyses. The lung is likewise removed, the left half of the lung is fixed in formalin for histopathological examination and the right half of the lung is deep-frozen for expression analyses. Furthermore, plasma samples are obtained to determine biomarkers (for example proBNP) and plasma substance concentrations.
B-6. Animal Model of Bleomycin-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis
Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the mouse or rat is a widely used animal model of pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic employed in oncology for the therapy of testicular tumours and Hodgkin- and Non-Hodgkin tumours. It is eliminated renally, has a half-life of about 3 hours and, as cytostatic, influences various phases of the division cycle [Lazo et al., Cancer Chemother. 15, 44-50 (1994)]. Its anti-neoplastic effect is based on an oxidatively damaging action on DNA [Hay et al., Arch. 65, 81-94 (1991)]. Lung tissue is at a particular risk when exposed to bleomycin since it contains only a small number of cysteine hydrolases which, in other tissues, lead to inactivation of bleomycin. Following administration of bleomycin, the animals suffer an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis.
Administration of bleomycin may be by single or repeat intratracheal, inhalative, intravenous or intraperitoneal administration. Treatment of the animals with the test substance (by gavage, by addition to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation) starts at the day of the first bleomycin administration or therapeutically 3-14 days later and extends over a period of 2-6 weeks. At the end of the study, lung function measurements, a bronchio-alveolar lavage to determine the cell content and the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers and a histological assessment of pulmonary fibrosis are carried out.
B-7. Animal Model of DQ12 Quartz-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis
DQ12 quartz-induced pulmonary fibrosis in the mouse or rat is a widely used animal model of pulmonary fibrosis [Shimbori et al., Exp. Lung Res. 36, 292-301 (2010)]. DQ12 quartz is quartz which is highly active owing to breaking or grinding. In mice and rats, intratracheal or inhalative administration of DQ12 quartz leads to alveolar proteinosis followed by interstitial pulmonary fibrosis. The animals receive a single or repeat intratracheal or inhalative instillation of DQ12 quartz. Treatment of the animals with the test substance (by gavage, by addition to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation) starts at the day of the first silicate instillation or therapeutically 3-14 days later and extends over a period of 3-20 weeks. At the end of the study, lung function measurements, a bronchio-alveolar lavage to determine the cell content and the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers and a histological assessment of pulmonary fibrosis are carried out.
B-8. Animal Model of DQ12 Quartz or FITC-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation
In the mouse and the rat, intratracheal administration of DQ12 quartz or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) leads to an inflammation in the lung [Shimbori et al., Exp. Lung Res. 36, 292-301 (2010)]. At the day of the instillation of DQ12 quartz or FITC or a day later the animals are treated with the test substance for a duration of 24 h up to 7 days (by gavage, by addition to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation). At the end of the experiment, a bronchio-alveolar lavage to determine the cell content and the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic markers is carried out.
B-9. Animal Model of Ovalbumin-Induced Allergic Respiratory Pathway Inflammation and Hyperreactivity
The animal model of ovalbumin-induced respiratory pathway information and hyperreactivity is a widely used animal model for bronchial asthma [Rückert et al., J. Immunol. 174, 5507-5515 (2005)]. Mice are sensitized on days 0, 14 and 21 by means of an intraperitoneal injection with the ovalbumin allergen in combination with adjuvant; the negative control receives an intraperitoneal injection of NaCl in combination with adjuvant. On days 28 and 29, the animals receive an intratracheal instillation of ovalbumin.
On day 30, a hyperreactivity test is conducted in the form of an inhalative provocation with a stepwise rise in concentration of a bronchoconstrictor, for example methacholine or adenosine monophosphate. First of all, the animals are anaesthetized by means of injected anaesthetic, then orotracheally intubated or tracheotomized and connected to a lung function system by means of a tube. First of all, lung function is measured by body plethysmography prior to provocation (including parameters such as tidal volume, breathing frequency, dynamic compliance and lung resistance). This is followed by measurement of lung function on inhalative provocation with a stepwise rise in concentration of the bronchoconstrictor. Thereafter, a bronchio-alveolar lavage is conducted to determine the cell content and the pro-inflammatory markers.
B-10. Animal Model of the Elastase-Induced Pulmonary Emphysema
The elastase-induced pulmonary emphysema in the mouse, rat or hamster is a widely used animal model of pulmonary emphysema [Sawada et al., Exp. Lung Res. 33, 277-288 (2007)]. The animals receive an orotracheal instillation of porcine pancreas elastase. The treatment of the animals starts at the day of the instillation of the porcine pancreas elastase and extends over a period of 3 weeks. At the end of the study, an alveolar morphometry is carried out.
B-11. Animal Model of Permanent Coronary Ligature in Mouse and Rat
Mice or rats are anaesthetized with 5% isoflurane in an anaesthetization cage, intubated, connected to a ventilation pump and ventilated with 2% of isoflurane/N2O/O2. The body temperature is maintained at 37-38° C. by a heating mat. Temgesic® is administered as painkiller. The chest is opened laterally between the third and fourth ribs, and the heart is exposed. The coronary artery of the left ventricle (LAD) is permanently ligated with an occlusion thread passed underneath shortly below its origin (below the left atrium). The thorax is closed again, and the muscle layers and the epidermis are sutured. From the day of the operation or up to a week later the animals are treated with the test substance over a period of 4-8 weeks (by gavage, by addition of the test substance to the feed or drinking water, using an osmotic minipump, by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection or by inhalation). A further control included is a sham group in which only the surgical procedure, but not the LAD occlusion, was performed.
At the end of the experiment, the animals are anaesthetized again [1.5% isoflurane (mouse), 2% isoflurane (rat)/N2O/air], and a pressure catheter is introduced via the carotid artery into the left ventricle. The heart rate, left-ventricular pressure (LVP), left-ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), contractility (dp/dt) and relaxation rate (tau) are measured there and analyzed with the aid of the Powerlab system (AD Instruments, ADI-PWLB-4SP) and the Chart5 software (SN 425-0586). A blood sample is then taken to determine the blood levels of the substance and plasma biomarkers, and the animals are sacrificed. The heart (heart chambers, left ventricle plus septum, right ventricle), liver, lung and kidney are removed and weighed.
B-12. Animal Model of Tumour Growth
Syngeneic tumour models in immunocompetent mice and xenogeneic tumour models in immunosuppressed mice are employed for substance assessment. For this purpose, tumour cells are cultivated in vitro and implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically. The animals are treated by oral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous therapy after the establishment of the tumour or starting on the day of tumour inoculation. The efficacy of the test substances is analysed in monotherapy and in combination therapy with other active pharmacological substances. During the experiment, the state of health of the animals is checked daily and the treatments are effected in accordance with animal protection regulations. The tumour area is measured with slide gauges (length L, breadth B=shorter dimension). The tumour volume is calculated by the formula (L×B2)/2. The inhibition in tumour growth is determined at the end of the study as the T/C ratio of the tumour areas or tumour weights and as the TGI value (tumour growth inhibition, calculated by the formula [1−(T/C)]×100) (T=tumour size in the treated group; C=tumour size in the untreated control group).
B-13. Animal Model of Formation of Metastases in the Lung
Syngeneic tumour models in immunocompetent mice and xenogeneic tumour models in immunosuppressed mice are employed for substance assessment. For this purpose, tumour cells are cultivated in vitro and injected into the tail vein of the test animals. The animals are treated by oral, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intravenous therapy. The efficacy of the test substances is analysed in monotherapy and in combination therapy with other active pharmacological substances. During the experiment, the state of health of the animals is checked daily and the treatments are effected in accordance with animal protection regulations. After the experiment has ended, the lungs of the test animals are examined microscopically with regard to the number of tumour colonies formed.
