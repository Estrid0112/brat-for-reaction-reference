FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention is in the field of pharmacology. Specifically, the present invention relates to piperazines derived from 7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,4-dihydrochromeno [4,3-c] pyrazole and 7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-2,4-dihydrochromene [4,3-c] pyrazole, its use for the manufacture of a medicament, the use of this medicament for the treatment and/or prevention of a disorder associated with the GPR55 receptor and the use of these compounds for pharmacological assays related to GPR55.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The GPR55 receptor was cloned and first identified in 1999. It is a G protein-coupled transmembrane receptor. Although it shares only 14% homology with the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, it was proposed as a new member of the endocannabinoid system. Indeed, cannabinoid receptor ligands were found to be able to activate the GPR55 receptor (GlaxoSmithKline WO0186305; AstraZeneca WO2004074844). Currently, there is controversy surrounding the pharmacology of GPR55. Today, GPR55 is still considered an orphaned receptor. However, endogenous lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) derivatives have been reported to stimulate the GPR55 receptor in ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays in HEK293 cells overexpressing hGPR55. To date, there are very few GPR55 receptor specific agonists and / or antagonists. Some benzoylpiperazine derivatives were identified as GPR55 agonists with no action on the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. A high screening pharmacological evaluation using β-arrestin assays in hGPR55-U20S cells identified several families of GPR55 agonists and selective GPR55 antagonists that led to molecular modeling studies.
The GPR55 receptor has been shown to be involved in the processes of inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, metabolic disorder, bone development, and tumor cell proliferation. Therefore, GPR55 is considered a biological target for the treatment of GPR55-related diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, osteoporosis, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, ovarian and prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and cutaneous carcinoma.
The compounds claimed in the present invention are chromenopyrazole-based structures. WO2010109050 describes chromenopyrazoles as cannabinoids with analgesic activity. More recently, in WO2014013117 and P201430372 chromenopyrazoles are described as antitumor drugs related to cannabinoid activity.
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present invention disclosed novel compounds useful as pharmacological tools for the validation of the GPR55 receptor and as therapeutic agents related to GPR55. The novel compounds of the present invention act on GPR55 receptors. Thus, they are useful for treating GPR55 receptor-related diseases and disorders, such as diabetes, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, neuropathic pain, osteoporosis, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer, glioblastoma and cutaneous carcinoma.

Oral administration is preferred because of the convenience of patients and the chronic nature of the diseases to be treated.
The administered amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon the relative efficacy of the compound selected, the severity of the disease to be treated and the patient's weight. However, the compounds of this invention will be administered one or more times a day, for example 1, 2, 3 or 4 times daily, with a total dose between 0.1 and 1000 mg / kg / day.

General Methods
Purification of the reaction products was performed by column chromatography using silica gel 60 Merck 230-400 mesh. The separation by semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography was performed on a Waters chromatograph integrated by a 2767 Sample Manager injector / manifold module, a System Fluidic Organizer separation module, a Photodiode Array 2998 (UV-visible) detector and a mass spectrophotometer 3100 Mass Detector. A SunFire ™ C18 reverse phase column (19 mm x 150 mm) is used for the separation. The mobile phases used are: A (MeCN + 0.1% formic acid) and B (H2O + 0.1% formic acid). The gradient was performed using a flow of 24 mL / min in 70 minutes monitoring at λ = 254 nm. Exact mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 6520 Accurate-Mass QTOF LC / MS spectrometer with a positive electrospray source. NMR analyzes were performed in the deuterated solvent indicated in each case. 13C-NMR, heteronuclear correlation HMBC and HSQC were recorded on a Mercury 400 (400 and 101 MHz) or Varian 500 (500 and 126 MHz) spectrometers at 25°C. The melting points were measured on an MP70 Mettler Toledo apparatus.
The starting product for the preparation of the compounds of formula (I) of the present invention is 7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,4-dihydrochromeno [4,3-c] pyrazole.
To synthesize the 7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,4-dihydrochromeno[4,3-c]pyrazole, the 2-hydroxy-4-methoxyacetophenone was cyclized with acetone. A-Formylation of 7-methoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one with microwave irradiation led to 3-hydroxymethylenecromen-4-one. Finally, condensation with anhydrous hydrazine gave the 7-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl-1,4-dihydrochromeno[4,3-cpyrazole.

C. Biological assays
In the present invention, the activity of the compounds of the invention on the GPR55 receptor was assessed by performing in vitro assays with real-time cell impedance measurements (xCELLigence experiments). These assays were performed on a HEK293 human embryonic kidney cell line overexpressing the recombinant GPR55 receptor in stable form (hGPR55-HEK293). The cells were seeded one day prior to carrying out the stimulation with the exemplary compounds of the present invention.
GPR55 agonist activity. Activation of the GPR55 receptor by an agonist compound causes a cellular impedance detected by the system and compared to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), a reference GPR55 ligand. The effect of LPI measured at a concentration of 1µM was set at 100%. The maximum response was observed at 5 minutes after the addition of the example compound of the invention. Therefore, dose-response curves were determined at this time. Cell impedance values were normalized for each well, just prior to addition of the inventive compound of the invention to be evaluated. The EC50 (nM) effective concentration values of some exemplary compounds of the present invention and the percentage of the maximum effect Emax (%) relative to the LPI activity are given below (Table 1) by way of illustration:

These values represent the mean with a 95% confidence interval calculated with 4 independent experiments performed in duplicate.
The compounds of examples 2, 4, 6-10, and 14 are partial agonists of the GPR55 receptor.
GPR55 antagonist activity. The ability of the exemplary compounds of the patent to inhibit LPI-mediated GPR55 receptor stimulation has been evaluated. The EC50 (nM) effective concentration values of LPI are given (Table 2) by way of illustration in the presence of certain exemplary compounds of the present invention at a concentration of 1 µM and the percentage of the maximum effect Emax (%) relative to LPI activity :

LPI & 1.6 (0.6-4.2) & 99 (90-108)
</table>
Values represent the mean with a 95% confidence interval calculated with 4 independent experiments performed in duplicate. Significant differences with respect to LPI values are considered due to lack of overlap of confidence intervals.
The compounds of Examples 7-10 are antagonists of the GPR55 agonist effect produced by LPI.
As a control experiment, it was found that the exemplary compounds of the present invention have no action on HEK293 cells that do not overexpress the GPR55 receptor. None of the compounds showed cell impedance.
With respect to cannabinoid activity, no exemplary compound of the present invention binds the cannabinoid receptor CB1. In what refers to the CB2 receptor binding, from all of the exemplary compounds, only 3 examples have affinity constant with a value of less than micromolar: example 2 (698 ± 107 nM), example 6 (15.4 ± 7.8 nM), example 9 (523 ± 144 nM).
D. Pharmacokinetic properties: in silico predictions
The pharmacokinetic profile of the exemplary compounds of the invention was determined by in silico prediction of physicochemical parameters using the QikProp program implemented in Maestro (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, USA). The values shown in Table 3 by the exemplary compounds of the patent follow Lipinski rules. Therefore, they are believed to be acceptable candidates for being part of a pharmaceutical composition.
