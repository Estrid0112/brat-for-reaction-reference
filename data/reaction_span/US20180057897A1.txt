FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a method of preparing a furan derivative via a keto-intermediate product. The method may further comprise a step of oxidizing the furan derivative to provide furandicarboxylic acid or a furandicarboxylic acid derivative.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Five-carbon and six-carbon furans such as furfural and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural may be derived from renewable resources and are promising platform chemicals which may be used in a wide range of applications. For instance, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural may be oxidized into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, a component of polyesters resembling polyethylene terephthalate but with improved barrier properties. The challenge of producing furan compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in high yield at low cost hinders such applications. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is traditionally produced from fructose, yet fructose is not as common as other sugars like sucrose and glucose and the pathways are not efficient. Therefore, new routes to furans like 5-hydroxymethylfurfural are needed.
One of the problems with 5-hydroxymethylfurfural synthesis is that 5-hydroxymethylfurfural itself is not very stable and is difficult to isolate. Therefore routes to furans in which 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is not an isolated intermediate are advantageous.
Moreover, most routes to bio-based furans use fructose as an intermediate. Glucose is a more common and cheaper sugar, but glucose is either converted into fructose in situ or ex situ to make furans such as 5-hydroxymethylfufural. Routes to furans which did not require fructose as an intermediate would be advantageous.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Therefore what is provided herein is a method of preparing a furan derivative comprising the steps of (a) converting a monosaccharide to provide a keto-intermediate product; and (b) dehydrating the keto-intermediate product to provide a furan derivative, wherein the keto-intermediate product is pre-disposed to forming keto-furanose tautomers in solution. The method may further comprise a step of oxidizing the furan derivative to provide a furandicarboxylic acid or a furandicarboxylic acid derivative. The furandicarboxylic acid derivative may be a furandicarboxylic acid ester.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
One of the reasons which makes fructose a key intermediate for production of bio-furans with 2,5-substituents is that fructose has a 2-keto functionality. This 2-keto functionality allows fructose to form keto-furanose tautomers in solution, and these keto-furanose tautomers are pre-disposed to dehydration into 2,5-disubstituted furans.
In contrast, glucose does not adopt any furanose forms, making it a poor precursor for furan formation. However, there are other sugars which can form furanose tautomers. In fact, sugars such as 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid, 2-keto-D-gluconate, 5-keto-D-gluconic acid, D-lyxo-5-hexosulose, and 3-deoxy-D-fructose adopt furanose forms at even higher fractions than fructose, and this pre-disposes them to dehydration into furans.
The invention takes this insight from the structure of fructose and applies it to non-fructose sugars. In effect, the invention converts other sugars into derivatives which have keto functionality like that of fructose and have a pre-disposition to form keto-furanose tautomers in solution.
As shown in
Table 1, NMR spectroscopy measurements show that fructose is present as more than 25% furanose form in water, and this fraction of furanose is even higher in other solvents such as DMSO. In contrast, glucose does not adopt any furanose forms, making it a poor precursor for furan formation. However, there are other sugars which can form furanose tautomers. In fact, sugars such as 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid, 2-keto-D-gluconate, 5-keto-D-gluconic acid, 3-deoxy-D-fructose, and D-lyxo-5-hexosulose adopt furanose forms at even higher fractions than fructose, and this pre-disposes them to dehydration into furans.

2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid, 5-keto-D-gluconic acid, and 2-keto-D-gluconate are the most common 2- or 5-keto sugars which are known to prefer furanose tautomeric forms. 4-deoxy-5-ketoglucaric acid is another example of a 5-keto sugar which occurs naturally. Several keto sugars which prefer furanose forms have been reported in the literature, including 3-deoxy-D-fructose, D-lyxo-5-hexulosonic acid, D-lyxo-5-hexosulose, and 4-deoxy-5-ketogalactaric acid. However, there are probably other 2- and 5-keto sugars which prefer furanose tautomeric forms but are not known.
Many of the 2-keto or 5-keto derivatives may be produced by enzymatic chemistry in high selectivity, including enzymes from the modified Entner-Doudoroff pathway. While it is most likely that the reaction pathway would be practiced with glucose, analogous pathways may be used with other C-6 sugars such as galactose and mannose.
Other dehydration products derived from glucose, sorbitol, or glucose oxidation products which have the 2-keto or 5-keto functionality for dehydration into furans include, but are not limited to, the following:

Alternatively, there are some 2- and 5-keto sugars which do not prefer furanose tautomeric forms, including L-sorbose, 5-ketoglucose, L-xylo-2-hexulosonic acid, D-glucosone, D-allosone, D-galactosone, and 3-deoxy-D-glucosone. These sugars would not be preferred candidates for dehydration to furans.

The tank is inoculated with a culture of Gluconobacter suboxydans IFO 12528 and agitated and aerated at 30° C. for 170 hours with pH maintained at pH 3.5 by controlled addition of sodium hydroxide. During the fermentation, glucose is converted to sodium 5-ketogluconate with traces of sodium gluconate and sodium 2-ketogluconate.

Example 4: Dehydration of Gluconate into 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic Acid
The dihydroxyacid dehydratase from Sulfolobus solfataricus (Kim, S; Lee, S. B. “Catalytic Promiscuity in Dihydroxy-Acid Dehydratase from the Thermoacidophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus.” Journal of Biochemisty, 2006, 139, 591-596) was expressed in E. coli. The gene was synthesized, cloned into a vector, and transformed into E. coli. Transformed E. coli were grown on a shake flask scale to express the heterologous dihydroxyacid dehydratase protein. On completion of the fermentation, protein was extracted using a detergent extraction reagent and clarified protein extracts were produced. Gluconate dehydration reactions were performed by combining the clarified cell extract in a 1:1 volume ratio with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer containing 40 mM sodium gluconate (measured pH 8.35). These were incubated at 60° C. for 24.75 hours and analyzed by liquid chromatography for conversion of gluconate. Nearly all of the gluconate was converted to a new product. For positive identification of the 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid product, proton NMR was used. Comparison of the spectra of the enzymatic reaction samples show that gluconate has disappeared from the reaction mixture and new peaks corresponding to the reported spectrum of 2-keto-3-deoxygluconic acid have appeared (reported spectrum from Plantier-Royon, R.; Cardona, F.; Anker, D.; Condemine, G.; Nasser, W.; Robert-Baudouy, J. Nouvelle Synthese de L'Acide 3-Desoxy-D-Erythro-2-Hexulosonique. J. Carbohydrate Chem. 1991, 10, 787-811).
