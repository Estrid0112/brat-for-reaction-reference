BACKGROUND
Human histidine triad nucleotide binding protein 1 (hHint1) has emerged as a target of interest due to its involvement in the regulation of a broad range of CNS functions, including opiate signaling, tolerance, neuropathic pain and nicotine dependence.1,2 Human hHint1 belongs to the histidine triad (HIT) superfamily which are characterized by their conserved sequence motif, His-X-His-X-His-XX, where X is a hydrophobic residue. Human hHint1 exists as a homodimer and possesses nucleoside phosphoramidase and acyl-AMP hydrolase activity, with a substrate preference for purine over pyrimidine nucleosides.3 Structural and kinetic studies have shown that hHint1 possess two identical and independent nucleotide-binding subunits.4-6 Each monomer consists of two alpha helices. A conserved string of hydrophobic residues in or adjacent to the β-sheets creates a binding pocket (S1) for the nucleobase, while the aspartate (43) residue anchors the ribose sugar. The α-monophosphate group interacts with a conserved string of polar residues including the partially positive His114 and the nucleophilic His112 in the active site.
The side chains of the nucleoside phosphoramidates or acyl-AMP can occupy a relative shallow and solvent accessible pocket containing the only tryptophan residue in hHint1. A nucleophilic histidine (His112) residue forming part of the active site triad of hHint1 is responsible for the catalysis. A detailed investigation of the kinetic mechanism of hHint1 has revealed that the mechanism proceeds by rapid formation of the nucleotidylated-His intermediate, followed by partially rate limiting, water mediated hydrolysis and subsequent release of the nucleoside monophosphate from the active site.5 The nucleoside phosphoramidase activity of hHint1 has been shown to be necessary for the activation of several preclinical and clinically approved antiviral and anticancer phsophramidate pronucleotides.7-10 In addition, Chou and Wagner et al. have demonstrated that lysyl t-RNA synthetase generated lysyl-AMP is also a substrate for hHint1 in vitro.11
Hint proteins are highly conserved across all the kingdoms of life, suggesting that they have an important biological function. Hint1 has been implicated in the regulation of MITF/USF2 transcriptional activation complex in mast cells,12 t-RNA synthetase amino acid adenylation,11 apoptosis13 and tumorigenicity.14
Hint1 is widely expressed in the region of brain primarily responsible for the modulation of pain [periaquaductal grey area (PAG)], addiction properties (nucleus accumbens) and the motor and sensory functions (cerebral cortex).1 In agreement with these results, alterations in gene function or aberrant expression of hHint1 have been found in the brain tissues of clinical patients suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.15 Moreover, Hint1−/− mice have been shown to exhibit hypersensitivity to amphetamine and decreased dependence on nicotine in self-administration studies.16,17
In addition, the NMDAR mediated feedback inhibition of the analgesic response has been demonstrated to be critically dependent on the co-association of Hint1 with MOR and NMDAR.18 Hence, Hint1−/− mice have shown to display an enhanced analgesic response Δδ=1.11 ppm indicating that nucleobase recognition maybe a key event in driving the molecular recognition of nucleotide based ligands by Hint1.
Given its involvement in, among other things, apoptosis, tumorigenicity, and pain modulation, new agents are desirable for the modulation (e.g., inhibition) of hHint1.
SUMMARY
Chemical genetics is a powerful approach to elucidate biological functions of genes or proteins of interest using screens of diverse and targeted small molecules. Screening small molecular libraries for a compound that induces a phenotype of interest represents forward chemical genetics, whereas the reverse approach uses small molecules targeted to a protein or gene of interest, to probe their biological function.20 Both approaches offer particular advantages of reversibility and the potential to modulate a single function. Recently, a non-hydrolyzable analog for hHint1 (compound 3, see FIG. 1a(3)), has been prepared by replacing the acyl-adenylate or phosphoramidate backbone in the substrate (compound 1 and 2, see FIG. 1a(1,2)) with a carbamate linker to yield compound 3. Compound 3 inhibits hHint1 with a low micromolar binding affinity (Kd=3.65±1.0 μM).2 Using reverse chemical genetics, it was demonstrated that compound 3 not only enhances morphine analgesia, but also rescues and prevents the development of NMDAR mediated morphine tolerance in mice.2 Importantly, the increase in the analgesic response and reduction in morphine tolerance were only observed in the wild type mice and not in Hint1−/− animals.2 Thus, compound 3 acts as a selective modulator of Hint1 in vivo. Moreover, a single dose of 3 was able to reduce mechanical allodynia in animals for several days. Nevertheless, compound 3 suffers from poor solubility and low micromolar binding affinity for hHint1.

In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made, as well as ammonium salts or quats.
The compounds of the disclosure can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.
Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form must be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.
Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).
Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.
Generally, the concentration of the compound(s) of formula I in a liquid composition, such as a lotion, will be from about 0.1-25 wt-%, preferably from about 0.5-10 wt-%. The concentration in a semi-solid or solid composition such as a gel or a powder will be about 0.1-5 wt-%, preferably about 0.5-2.5 wt-%.
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.
In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 10 to about 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day.
The compound is conveniently administered in unit dosage form; for example, containing 5 to 1000 mg, conveniently 10 to 750 mg, most conveniently, 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.
In some embodiments, the active ingredient is administered to achieve peak plasma concentrations of the active compound of from about 0.5 to about 75 μM, preferably, about 1 to 50 μM, most preferably, about 2 to about 30 μM. This may be achieved, for example, by the intravenous injection of a 0.05 to 5% solution of the active ingredient, optionally in saline, or orally administered as a bolus containing about 1-100 mg of the active ingredient. Desirable blood levels may be maintained by continuous infusion to provide about 0.01-5.0 mg/kg/hr or by intermittent infusions containing about 0.4-15 mg/kg of the active ingredient(s).
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.
The compounds described herein can generally be prepared using procedures similar to those described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,475,985.
The disclosure provides hydrolyzable nucleotide analogs for hHint1 that contain an acyl-sulfamate or acyl-sulfamide linker that mimics the corresponding phosphoramidate and acyl-phosphate moieties.

Meyer) packed with two columns of neutral alumina and dispensed under argon. DMA and Pyridine was purchased in a sure seal bottle from Sigma-Aldrich. Thin-layer chromatography was performed using EMD pre-coated silica gel 60 F-254 plates. All preparative separations were performed using Teledyne Isco combiflash system and using RediSepRf high performance gold silica pre-packed columns. Analytical HPLC for the stability studies were performed on Agilent C18 zorbax SB-Aq column (3.5 μm, 4.6×150 mm) using water (solvent A) and acetontrile (solvent B) with 0.1% TEA as additive. High-resolution mass spectrometry was performed LTQ Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Scientific™). Samples and compounds during synthesis were freeze-dried with a lyophilizer available from Labonaco. All 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were collected in d6-DMSO (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, Mass.) at 25° C. using Ascend™ Bruker spectrometer 500 MHz at the Department of Medicinal Chemistry CCRB NMR facility at the University of Minnesota unless otherwise stated. All NMR chemical shifts were recorded in δ parts per million using d6-DMSO as internal reference. Thermodynamic measurements for protein-ligand association were performed in 96-well plates (Nunc 260251 U96 DeepWell 96-Well×1.3 ml from thermo scientific) using MicroCal Auto-ITC200 system (GE Healthcare life sciences). Nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) was purchased from Qiagen and cobalt column agarose from Thermofishcer Scientific. Biological buffers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Protein Expression and Purification
The full-length sequence of hHint1 was expressed from the pMCSG7 vector (N-terminal, tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavable His6 tag) in Rosetta2 pLysS cells. The cells were grown in 2×1 L LB (Fischer Scientific) media with ampicillin (100 mg/L, Sigma-Aldrich), chloramphenicol (34 mg/L, Sigma-Aldrich), and glucose (0.1% w/v, BD Difco) at 37° C. with shaking at 250 rpm. At OD600=0.7, cultures were induced to a final concentration of 1 mM IPTG (Denville Scientific Inc) and incubated at 25° C. overnight. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 7,500 g at 4° C. for 10 min and the pellets were collected, then resuspended in buffer A (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole), which was then adjusted to 1 mg·mL−1 lysozyme and Benzonase nuclease (20 ul). The resuspended cells were lysed by sonication (eight cycles of 30 s on, 30 s off) at 4° C. The cell debris was removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 16,000 g at 4° C. for 45 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a nickel affinity column, washed with buffer A, and then eluted with an imidazole gradient using buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 500 mm imidazole). Fractions containing desired protein was combined and to it was added N-terminally His-tagged TEV protease 2% (w/w). The resulting solutions was transferred to a dialysis tubing (molecular weight cut-off of 6000-7000 Da) and dialyzed against 2 L of TEV cleavage buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) overnight at 4° C. The dialyzed protein was then buffer exchanged into buffer A and passed through cobalt affinity chromatography to remove TEV protease. The flow through obtained was concentrated to 5 mL and further purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC buffer, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol). Pure fractions were collected and concentrated. The protein concentration was then determined using A280 absorbance in nanodrop using calculated extinction coefficient of 8480 M−1 cm−1 and molecular weight of 14000 Da. The final protein was stored in the stored at −80° C. until in use.
Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)
ITC experiments were conducted on a MicroCal Auto-ITC200 system (GE Healthcare life sciences). All titration experiments were performed at 20° C. in ITC buffer (10 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). hHint1 was exchanged into ITC buffer using Micro biospin6 columns (BioRad, USA) and final protein concentrations were determined as described above. To determine the dissociation constant of stock concentration (300-400 uM) of inhibitors was titrated with 15-20 uM of Hint1. Twenty injections of ligand were injected (injection volume 2 ul) into the protein cell. The resulting change in enthalpy was measured and the background heat of dilution was subtracted by performing similar experiments in the absence of inhibitors. The background heat of dilution was subtracted from the resulting data and was fitted into one-site binding model using the ITC200 microcal software. The resulting association constant obtained by fitting the curve was converted into Kd using Ka=1/Kd relationship.
Analytical HPLC Studies to Determine the Stability of the Inhibitors.
Analytical studies were performed on a Beckman coulter system gold operated by Karat software, with an Agilent C18 Zorbax SBAq column (4.6×150 mm, 3.5 μm). Stock solutions (10 mM) of the inhibitors were prepared in a Tris buffer (10 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). For stability studies, the stock solutions were diluted to a concentration of 50-100 uM using Phosphate Buffer Saline buffer (PBS) and incubated at 37° C. At indicated time points 200 ul aliquots of the sample volume were withdrawn and injected into the HPLC system for monitoring the stability and degradation of the compounds. The samples were eluted using the gradient of solvent A (Water) and B (CH3CN) with a 0.1% triethylamine additive (0-4 min: gradient 0% B, 4-14 min: gradient 20% B, 14-29 min: gradient 80% B, flow rate 0.5 ml/min) with detection at 168-400 nm.
General Procedure for Acid-NHS Ester Preparations.
N-Hydroxysuccinimide (0.62 g, 0.0053 mol, 1.0 equiv.) followed by EDC (0.00795 mmol, 1.5 equiv.) was added to a solution of the respective acid (0.0053 mol, 1.0 equiv) in anhydrous THF (13 mL). The solution was stirred for 21 h at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated in vacuum and the resulting residue dissolved in ethylacetate (80 mL). The organic phase was washed with saturated NaHCO3 (2×20 mL) and NaCl solution (2×20 mL), dried with NaSO4, and filtered. The solvent was removed under vacuum to give crude NHS ester. The crude product was recrystallized with ethylacetate/petroleum ether to obtain the desired NHS esters below. The esters were used for coupling without any further purification. 1H and 13C NMR indicated relatively clean esters (see below).

The effect of a non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analog Bio-AMS was compared with compound 3 on the activity of hHint1 using a fluorescence assay described previously.3

At a fixed saturating substrate concentration, both Bio-AMS 5'-amino-5'-N-(biotinyl)sulfamoyl-5'-doxyadenosine and compound 3 exhibited a dose dependent decrease in the activity of hHint1 with maximum half inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 1.0±0.3 μM and 25.5±6.0 μM respectively. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to investigate the nature of non-covalent interactions on the inhibitory activity of Bio-AMS on hHint1. The ITC studies provided an experimental dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.32±0.1 μM with an n value of 1.0±0.1 indicating one binding site per hHint1 monomer. Bio-AMS was found to bind approximately 11 and 209 fold more tightly than compound 3 and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) respectively, and to be dominated by enthalpy and not entropy.
In order to avoid potential off target effects on enzymes utilizing adenosine and adenosine nucleotide based substrates, analogues of compound 3 containing an acyl-sulfamate or acyl-sulfamide backbone (see FIG. 1B) were developed. The first inhibitor examined was based on the replacement of the carbamate backbone in 3 with an acyl-sulfamate backbone. The synthesis of compound 4 (Scheme 1) began with 5'-OH sulfamoylation of 2',3'-O-isopropylidene guanosine (8) to provide intermediate 9. Coupling of 9 with the N-hydroxysuccinic acid ester of 3-indole propionic acid in the presence of DBU (1,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0] undec-7-ene) afforded 10. Deprotection of the acetonide in compound 10 with aqueous TFA yielded the final compound 4. In similar fashion compound 5 with a butyric acid side chain was synthesized.

Structural studies performed using x-ray crystallography or NMR provide an insight into the molecular recognition driving the interaction between a protein and a ligand. Using 2D-NMR studies, Shapiro and co-workers investigated and identified key interactions between nucleoside monophosphates and mouse Hint1.22 Their 1H-15N HSQC investigations revealed large chemical shift perturbations (Δδ>0.2 ppm) for the residues surrounding the canopy holding the nucleobase and sugar upon addition of the nucleoside monophosphate. Isoleucine 44 in the S1 hydrophobic pocket exhibited the largest chemical shift difference of Δδ=1.11 ppm indicating that nucleobase recognition maybe a key event in driving the molecular recognition of nucleotide based ligands by Hint1.
The impact of a hydrophobic nucleoside inhibitor with an acyl-sulfamate backbone was explored by replacing the guanosine base in 4 with a tricyclic ethenoadenosine base. Compound 7 provides an additional advantage of stability towards cyclonucleoside formation when compared to an adenosine nucleobase due to the extensive delocalization of the N-3 nitrogen electrons into the tricyclic ring system. The synthesis of compound 7 (Scheme 2) began with the cyclization of exocyclic amine in 11 with chloroacetaldehyde in mildly acidic sodium acetate buffer at 40° C. to yield the fluorescent compound 12. The formation of 12 in the reaction mixture can be easily monitored on thin layer chromatography due to its fluorescent properties. Compound 12 was then treated with sulfamoyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine to yield compound 13. Coupling of 13 with the N-hydroxysuccinic acid ester of 3-indole propionic acid in the presence of DBU followed by deprotection of the acetonide with aqueous TFA yielded compound 7. To avoid potential decomposition due to the intrinsically acidic free acyl-sulfamate group, all the acyl-sulfamate compounds (4, 5 and 7) were prepared and purified as a triethylammonium salt using reverse phase chromatography. Stability studies performed on all the compounds using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed no cyclonucleoside formation at 37° C. over 48 h in phosphate buffered saline. This result is in striking contrast to the previously reported rapid decomposition of the acyl-sulfamate analog of Bio-AMS via cyclonucleoside formation.21

Replacement of the 5'-oxygen atom in the acyl-sulfamate with a nitrogen affords an acyl-sulfamide backbone, which increases the pKa of the backbone NH by 2-3 units. The increased pKa has been shown to increase the stability and the binding affinity of Bio-AMS towards biotin protein ligase.20 Hence, compound 6 was designed to investigate the impact of the enhanced negative charge of the backbone on the binding affinity of hHint1. The synthesis of compound 6 (Scheme 3) began with protection of the exocyclic nitrogen on compound 8 with N, N-dimethyl formamide dimethylacetal to yield N, N-dimethyl aminomethylene-2'-3'-O-isopropylidene guanosine (14). Iodination of the 5'-hydroxy group in 14 with methyltriphenoxyphosphonium iodide (MTPI) in a Moffat reaction afforded compound 14a (see supporting info). Displacement of the iodide in 14a with sodium azide followed by reduction under the Staudinger reaction conditions yielded compound 16 with a 5'-amine on the ribose sugar. Next, the corresponding 5'-amino nucleoside was converted to the 5'-sulfamide by refluxing compound 16 with sulfamide (NH2SO2NH2) in 1,4-dioxane for 2 h.23 Surprisingly, this step also resulted in the removal of the N, N-dimethyl aminomethylene of the exocyclic amine along with the formation of the desired product. The crude 5'-sulfamide nucleoside was then stirred in sodium hydroxide/methanol solution to completely deprotect the N, N-dimethyl aminomethylene group to afford 17 in an overall yield of 34% over two steps. Coupling of 17 to the N-hydroxysuccinic acid ester of 3-indole propionic acid in the presence of DBU followed by the deprotection of the acetonide with aqueous TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) yielded the final compound 6. All the compounds prepared above displayed superior aqueous solubility compared to compound 3. Stock solutions up to 5 mM for the guanosine analogues (compound 4, 5 and 6) and 20 mM for 7 were easily prepared in aqueous buffers.

The in vitro binding affinity of the new series was evaluated of analogues for hHint1 using isothermal calorimetry (ITC). In comparison to 3, compound 4 displayed a 4.5 fold increase in binding affinity with a measured dissociation constant of 0.81±0.11 μM for hHint1 (Table 1).

The increased binding affinity of 4 is likely due to electrostatic and/or hydrogen-bonding interactions of the acyl-sulfamate backbone, with polar side chains in the active site, as indicated by the increased gain in the enthalpic component over 3.
Increasing the pKa of the backbone with a sulfamide in compound 6 did not alter the binding affinity of compound 1 as indicated by their similar dissociation constants. Attachment of an indole side chain intramolecularly to a nucleoside has been shown to dynamically quench the fluorescence of the indole side chain due to stacking interaction of the indole ring on the nucleobase.24 Therefore, one might predict that compounds 4 and 5 are likely to encounter a higher entropic penalty upon binding to hHint1. Consequently, one might propose that removal of the indole group in compound 5 would likely increase the binding affinity by decreasing the entropic cost of binding to hHint1. Surprisingly, the dissociation constant for compound 5 for hHint1 was found to be in a 3-4 fold greater in comparison to 4 (Table 1). Comparing the thermodynamic parameters of 4 and 5 revealed no significant differences in the entropy of binding. However, compound 5 displayed a nearly 2 kcal mol−1 decrease in the enthalpy of binding. These results indicate that increasing interactions associated with the active site can improve the ligand binding affinity.
Consistent with this observation, compound 7 in which a tricyclic nucleobase has been incorporated, resulted in an increased binding affinity with a measured dissociation constant of 0.23±0.01 μM. Compound 7 displayed an increase in binding affinity of 16 and 291 fold over compound 3 and GMP, respectively. In comparison with 4, a nearly 1 kcal mol−1 increase in the enthalpy of binding was observed for 7, with no observable difference in the entropic component. These results indicate that, while ligand and active site desolvation is important the interactions of the ligand with the active site appear to dominate biomolecular recognition of the ligands by hHint1.
The compounds disclosed herein can permit the modulation of processes that are potentially regulated by HINT1 at the cell membrane, such as MOR-NMDAR cross-regulation. The ability of the HINT enzymatic inhibitor guanosine-5'-tryptamine carbamate (TpGc) (3)2 on the capacity of morphine to promote antinociception and in the development of antinociceptive tolerance. The intra-cerebroventricular (icv), administration of TpGc to mice potentiated morphine-evoked antinociception and reduced the development of acute tolerance. A single icv administration of TpGc to mice suffering chronic constriction injury (CCI) led to a significant attenuation of mechanical allodynia that persisted for several days, suggesting a regulatory role for HINT1 in its interaction with NMDARs.
Based on the bioactvity of TpGc, it is believed that the compounds of formula I will exhibit similar beneficial results in other mammals, including humans. Therapeutically effective doses of the compounds of formula I can be derived from the amounts employed to reduce pain and tolerance, e.g., in compounds interacting with the μ (“mu”) opioid receptor.

Example 8. Evaluation of Compound 7
The interactions between the mu-opioid (MOR) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDAR) receptors are an area of intense investigation due to their contribution to maladaptive neuroplasticity. Recent evidence suggests that their association requires the involvement of histidine triad nucleotide binding protein (HINT1). Since it is known that spinal blockade of NMDA receptors prevents the development of opioid analgesic tolerance, it was hypothesized that spinal inhibition of the HINT1 enzyme may similarly inhibit opioid tolerance. Given the similar mechanisms underlying the development of both opioid analgesic tolerance and neuropathic pain, we reasoned that HINT1 inhibition may reduce the development of neuropathic pain, consistent with prior observations that antagonism of NMDA receptors inhibits both developments. Blockade of NMDA receptors is known to inhibit the development of MOR analgesic tolerance. To address these questions HINT1 inhibitors were evaluated in three models of spinal neuroplasticity: morphine-induced inhibition of NMDA-evoked behavior, endomorphin-2 induced analgesic tolerance, and spared nerve injury.
A. Inhibition of Morphine Inhibition of NMDA-Evoked Behavior (FIGS. 2A-C).
Male ICR mice (25-30) were given TpGc (10 nmol) 10 minutes before morphine sulfate (10 nmol) intrathecally. After a period of 10 minutes, NMDA was injected intrathecally and scratching and biting behaviors were quantified. The MPE % was calculated using morphine alone as the positive control.
The results shown in FIGS. 2A-C show that HINT1 inhibition attenuates or reverses the development of chronic pain behaviors. Male and Female ICR mice (25-30 g) were given 1 nmol of TpGc prior to (Panel A) or 7 days post (Panel B) spared nerve injury. A separate cohort (Panel C) of male ICR mice (25-50 g) were given 1 nmol of compound 7 intrathecally both prior to and 7 days post spared nerve injury. All cohorts were evaluated with Von Frey mechanical threshold testing. Pretreatment with TpGc led to a sustained attenuation of SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. Injection of TpGc on day 7 following injury led to a transient reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity. Pretreatment with TpGc3a (Panel C) did not lead to an attenuation of pain behavior, however injection of 1 nmol of compound 7 on day 7 following injury did lead to a transient reversal that resolved at 4 hours post injection.
B. Inhibition of Opioid Tolerance
Male ICR mice (25-30 g) were given seven (7) intrathecal injections of either saline, morphine, HINT1 inhibitor, or HINT1 inhibitor+morphine over the course of 3 days. A final probe dose of intrathecal morphine was give and mice were behaviorally assessed via a tail flick assay. The maximum possible effect was calculated ((postdrug latency-predrug latency)/(cutoff-predrug latency)) and ED50 values were calculated by parametric linear regression analysis of the log dose-response curves according to Tallarida and Murray, 1987.
The results showed that TpGc and analogs inhibit morphine's ability to inhibit NMDA-evoked behaviors. Male mice were given intrathecal treatment of either morphine or morphine+a HINT1 inhibitor. They were then given an intrathecal injection of NMDA and scratching and biting behaviors were counted for 1 minute. Pretreatment with either TpGc (ED50=0.61 nM (0.28, 1.4)) or compound 7 (ED50=0.47 nM (0.20, 1.1)) attenuated morphine's inhibition of NMDA-evoked behavior. Other compounds that were tested include:

Male and female ICR mice were given 1 nmol of HINT1 inhibitor TpGc or 7 intrathecally either immediately prior to or 7 days following induction of neuropathic pain via spared nerve injury (Decosterd, 2000). Briefly, an incision is made into the leg of the mouse directly above the branching of the sciatic nerve. The peroneal and tibial branches of the nerve are ligated and cut while the sural branch is left intact, leading to a localized hypersensitivity on the lateral portion of the hindpaw. Von Frey mechanical testing was performed prior to surgery and for up to 7 days post surgery.
The results shown in FIGS. 3A-B show the effects of HINT1 inhibitors TpGc or compound 7 on development of morphine tolerance. Subjects underwent a tolerance development protocol where they were pre-treated with either saline, morphine, HINT1 inhibitor, or HINT1 inhibitor+morphine intrathecally for 3 days. Analgesic dose-response curves were generated following acute intrathecal morphine challenge on Day 4. Subjects treated with morphine displayed decreased morphine potency and efficacy, indicating the induction of chronic morphine analgesic tolerance. However, pretreatment with HINT1 inhibitors displayed equivalent potency and efficacy compared to the saline pre-treatment, indicating a lack of opioid tolerance.
These studies indicate to that disruption of HINT1 via enzymatic inhibitors TpGc and compound 7 is a viable strategy to target maladaptive plasticity involving MOR and NMDA-mediated signaling. Delivery of TpGc and TpGc3a attenuate the development of opioid tolerance, attenuate or reverse chronic pain behaviors (FIGS. 3A-B) and interrupts morphine's inhibition of NMDA-evoked scratching and biting behaviors (FIGS. 2A-C). These results elucidate the interaction of MOR and NMDAR interaction at the level of the spinal cord.
