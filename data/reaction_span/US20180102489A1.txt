BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to a compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that produce full-color images, and also have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, as well as excellent characteristics in terms of brightness, driving voltage, and response speed.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transit from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.
SUMMARY
One or more embodiments provide a compound suitable for use as a light-emitting material and an organic light-emitting device including the same, wherein the organic light-emitting device has high efficiency, a low driving voltage, high luminance, and long lifespan.

The term “organic layer” used herein refers to a single layer and/or a plurality of layers disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode of an organic light-emitting device. A material included in the “organic layer” is not limited to an organic material.
FIG. 1 is a schematic view of an organic light-emitting device 10 according to an embodiment. The organic light-emitting device 10 includes a first electrode 110, an organic layer 150, and a second electrode 190.
Hereinafter, the structure of an organic light-emitting device according to an embodiment and a method of manufacturing an organic light-emitting device according to an embodiment will be described in connection with FIG. 1.
In FIG. 1, a substrate may be additionally disposed under the first electrode 110 or above the second electrode 190. The substrate may be a glass substrate or a transparent plastic substrate, each having excellent mechanical strength, thermal stability, transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and water resistance.
The first electrode 110 may be formed by depositing or sputtering a material for forming the first electrode 110 on the substrate. When the first electrode 110 is an anode, the material for forming the first electrode 110 may be selected from materials with a high work function to facilitate hole injection. The first electrode 110 may be a reflective electrode, a semi-transmissive electrode, or a transmissive electrode. The material for forming the first electrode 110 may be a transparent and highly conductive material, and examples of such a material are indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO2), and zinc oxide (ZnO). When the first electrode 110 is a semi-transmissive electrode or a reflective electrode, at least one selected from magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al-Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg-In), and magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag) may be used as a material for forming the first electrode 110.
The first electrode 110 may have a single-layered structure, or a multi-layered structure including two or more layers. For example, the first electrode 110 may have a three-layered structure of ITO/Ag/ITO, but the structure of the first electrode 110 is not limited thereto.
The organic layer 150 is disposed on the first electrode 110. The organic layer 150 may include an emission layer.

The hole transport region may have a single-layered structure formed of a single material, a single-layered structure formed of a plurality of different materials, or a multi-layered structure having a plurality of layers formed of a plurality of different materials.
For example, the hole transport region may have a single-layered structure formed of a plurality of different materials, or a hole injection layer/hole transport layer structure, a hole injection layer/hole transport layer/buffer layer structure, a hole injection layer/buffer layer structure, a hole transport layer/buffer layer structure, or a hole injection layer/hole transport layer/electron blocking layer structure, wherein layers of each structure are sequentially stacked from the first electrode 110 in this stated order, but are not limited thereto.

When a hole injection layer is formed by vacuum deposition, for example, the vacuum deposition may be performed at a deposition temperature of about 100° C. to about 500° C., at a vacuum degree of about 10−8 torr to about 10−3 torr, and at a deposition rate of about 0.01 Å/sec to about 100 Å/sec by taking into account the compound for the hole injection layer to be deposited, and the structure of the hole injection layer to be formed.
When a hole injection layer is formed by spin coating, the spin coating may be performed at a coating rate of about 2,000 rpm to about 5,000 rpm, and at a temperature of about 80° C. to about 200° C. by taking into account the compound for the hole injection layer to be deposited, and the structure of the hole injection layer to be formed.
When the hole transport region includes a hole transport layer, the hole transport layer may be formed on the first electrode 110 or the hole injection layer by using one or more suitable methods selected from vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, a LB method, ink-jet printing, laser-printing, and laser-induced thermal imaging. When the hole transport layer is formed by vacuum deposition or spin coating, deposition and coating conditions for the hole transport layer may be the same as the deposition and coating conditions for the hole injection layer.

R213 and R214 in Formulae 201A and 201A-1 may be linked to form a saturated or unsaturated ring.
The compound represented by Formula 201, and the compound represented by Formula 202 may each include compounds HT1 to HT20 illustrated below, but are not limited thereto.
A thickness of the hole transport region may be in a range of about 100 Å to about 10,000 Å, for example, about 100 Å to about 1,000 Å. When the hole transport region includes a hole injection layer and a hole transport layer, the thickness of the hole injection layer may be in a range of about 100 Å to about 10,000 Å, and for example, about 100 Å to about 1,000 Å, and the thickness of the hole transport layer may be in a range of about 50 Å to about 2,000 Å, and for example, about 100 Å to about 1,500 Å. When the thicknesses of the hole transport region, the hole injection layer and the hole transport layer are within these ranges, satisfactory hole transporting characteristics may be obtained without a substantial increase in driving voltage.
The hole transport region may further include, in addition to these materials, a charge-generation material for the improvement of conductive properties. The charge-generation material may be homogeneously or non-homogeneously dispersed in the hole transport region.
The charge-generation material may be, for example, a p-dopant. The p-dopant may be one selected from a quinone derivative, a metal oxide, and a cyano group-containing compound, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto. For example, non-limiting examples of the p-dopant are a quinone derivative, such as tetracyanoquinonedimethane (TCNQ) or 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-tetracyano-1,4-benzoquinonedimethane (F4-TCNQ); a metal oxide, such as a tungsten oxide or a molybdenum oxide, and Compound HT-D1 illustrated below, but are not limited thereto.
The hole transport region may further include a buffer layer, in addition to an electron blocking layer, a hole injection layer, and a hole transport layer. Since the buffer layer may compensate for an optical resonance distance according to a wavelength of light emitted from the emission layer, light emission efficiency of a formed organic light-emitting device may be improved. For use as a material included in the buffer layer, materials that are to be included in the hole transport region may be used. The electron blocking layer prevents injection of electrons from the electron transport region.
An emission layer is formed on the first electrode 110 or the hole transport region by using one or more suitable methods selected from vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, a LB method, ink-jet printing, laser-printing, and laser-induced thermal imaging. When an emission layer is formed by vacuum deposition or spin coating, deposition and coating conditions for the emission layer may be the same as those for the hole injection layer.
When the organic light-emitting device 10 is a full-color organic light-emitting device, the emission layer may be patterned into a red emission layer, a green emission layer, or a blue emission layer, according to a sub-pixel. In one or more embodiments, the emission layer may have a stacked structure including a red emission layer, a green emission layer, and a blue emission layer, or may include a red light-emitting material, a green light-emitting material, and a blue light-emitting material, which are mixed with each other in a single layer, to emit white light.
The emission layer may include a host and a dopant.
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the host may include the compound represented by Formula 1.
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the dopant may include the compound represented by Formula 1.
For example, the host may further include at least one selected from TPBi, TBADN, ADN (also referred to as “DNA”), CBP, CDBP, and TCP:

Comparative Example 1
As an anode, a Corning 15 Ω/cm2 (1,200 Å) ITO glass substrate was cut to a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm, sonicated with isopropyl alcohol and pure water each for 5 minutes, and then cleaned by exposure to ultraviolet rays and ozone for 30 minutes. Then, the resultant ITO glass substrate was provided to a vacuum deposition apparatus.
Compound (2-TNATA), which is a known compound, was vacuum-deposited on the ITO glass substrate to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 600 Å, and Compound NPB, which is a hole transport compound, was vacuum-deposited on the hole injection layer to form a hole transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
9,10-di-naphthalene-2-yl-anthracene (ADN), which is a known blue fluorescent host, and N,N,N',N'-tetraphenyl-pyrene-1,6-diamine (TPD), which is a known blue fluorescent dopant, were co-deposited on the hole transport layer at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
Then, Alq3 was deposited on the emission layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å. LiF, which is an alkali metal halide, was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å, and Al was vacuum-deposited on the electron injection layer to form a LiF/Al electrode (cathode electrode) having a thickness of 3,000 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
