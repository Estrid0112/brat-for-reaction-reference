BACKGROUND
RNA is an important target for small molecule probes of function or lead therapeutics. Yet, very few RNAs have been exploited as such. Validated targets include ribosomal RNA,1, 2 which constitutes 80-90% of total cellular RNA,3-5 and riboswitches, that have known metabolite binders that can be mimicked to aid inhibitor design.6, 7 Compounds targeting the ribosome and riboswitches have been extremely useful probes to help understand RNA function. One major challenge in RNA chemical biology is how to exploit other RNAs in the transcriptome similarly. This is a considerable challenge given the low cellular abundance of these RNAs8 and the lack of lead small molecules.9
In an effort to exploit other potential RNA targets in the transcriptome with small molecules, we have developed a “bottom-up” strategy to design small molecules that bind an RNA of interest. That is, we define the small, discrete RNA secondary structural elements that are privileged for binding small molecules;10-14 the interactions are then deposited into a database. The secondary structural elements in our selection studies are kept intentionally small such that they are likely components of larger cellular RNAs. The secondary structure of an RNA target is compared to our database of interactions, providing lead compounds. Leads can be optimized using various strategies including chemical similarity searching15, 16 and/or modular assembly.13, 17-22 One application of this strategy has been the rational design of bioactive small molecules that target the RNA that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).15, 17, 18
DM1 is a presently incurable neuromuscular disease caused by a r(CUG) expansion, r(CUG)exp, in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) mRNA.23, 24 The RNA folds into a hairpin structure that displays regularly repeating 1×1 nucleotide internal loops (5'CUG/3'GUC motifs; FIG. 1)25, 26 that are conformationally flexible.8, 27 The loops are high affinity binding sites for muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL1), and sequestration of MBNL1 causes its inactivation and subsequent dysregulation of alternative pre-mRNA splicing.28-31 Formation of the r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 complex causes various disease-associated defects including (FIG. 1): (i) pre-mRNA splicing defects;28, 32-34 (ii) formation of nuclear foci that consist of r(CUG)exp-protein complexes;35-37; and, (iii) translational defects of DMPK mRNA due to poor nucleocytoplasmic transport.38-40
Since the root cause of DM1 is r(CUG)exp, a variety of strategies have been employed to disrupt r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 complexes, thus releasing MBNL1 and restoring regulation of alternative splicing. Oligonucleotides that target r(CUG)exp improve DM1-associated defects upon injection into DM1 mouse models.33, 41, 42 Small molecules have also been developed that target r(CUG)exp including pentamidine, bis-bcnzimidazoles, naphthyl pyridines, and triazines.13, 15, 17-19, 43-46 The most potent are modularly assembled compounds that target the repeating nature of r(CUG)exp, binding multiple 5'CUG/3'GUC motifs simultaneously.13, 17-19 These compounds are composed of a modular assembly scaffold that displays multiple copies of an RNA-binding module on a single chain.13, 17-19
SUMMARY
Transcriptomes provide a myriad of potential RNAs that could be the targets of therapeutics or chemical genetic probes of function. Cell permeable small molecules, however, generally do not exploit these targets, owing to the difficulty in the design of high affinity, specific small molecules targeting RNA. As part of a general program to study RNA function using small molecules, we designed bioactive, modularly assembled small molecules that target the non-coding expanded RNA repeat that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), r(CUG)exp. Herein, we present a rigorous study to elucidate features in modularly assembled compounds that afford bioactivity.
Different modular assembly scaffolds were investigated including polyamines, α-peptides, β-peptides, and peptide tertiary amides (PTAs). Based on activity as assessed by improvement of DM1-associated defects, stability against proteases, cellular permeability, and toxicity, we discovered that constrained backbones, namely PTAs, are optimal. Notably, we determined that r(CUG)exp is the target of the optimal PTA in cellular models and that the optimal PTA improves DM1-associated defects in a mouse model. Biophysical analyses were employed to investigate potential sources of bioactivity. These investigations show that modularly assembled compounds have increased residence times on their targets and faster on rates than the RNA-binding modules from which they were derived; and faster on rates than the protein that binds r(CUG)exp, the inactivation of which gives rise to DM1-associated defects. These studies provide information about features of small molecules that are programmable for targeting RNA, allowing for the facile optimization of therapeutics or chemical probes against other cellular RNA targets.
Herein, we describe detailed studies aimed at understanding features in modular assembly scaffolds that provide bioactivity. It is shown that the nature of the scaffold significantly affects potency and bioactivity. By studying different scaffolds including polyamines, α-peptides, β-peptides, and peptide-tertiary amides (PTAs), we determined that the PTA scaffold is optimal based on bioactivity in two different cellular assays, stability against proteases, cellular permeability, and toxicity. These studies define features that can be programmed into small molecules to afford bioactivity and can be applied to other potential RNA targets in the transcriptome.

Design of Modularly Assembled Compounds.
We previously reported the design of modularly assembled compounds that inhibit the r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 complex in vitro13 and in vivo18. The compounds are comprised of a peptoid backbone that displays multiple copies of the bis-benzimidazole Ht separated by four spacing modules, or nH-4 compounds (FIG. 2). The 2H-4 compound is the most efficacious in DM1 cell culture models, improving various DM1-associated defects (FIG. 1).18 In an effort to understand features in modularly assembled compounds that afford high affinity binding to r(CUG)exp and bioactivity, we designed and synthesized a series of second-generation compounds in which the assembly scaffold was varied. In particular, we studied polyamines, α-peptide, β-peptide, peptoid, and peptide tertiary amide (PTA) assembly scaffolds (FIG. 2). These scaffolds allowed us to study of the effect of: (i) forming favorable interactions with a negatively charged phosphodiester backbone (polyamines); (ii) amide bond spacing (α- and β-peptides); (iii) N-alkylation (α- and β-peptides, peptoids, and PTAs); and, (iv) chirality of the C-α carbon atom (PTAs and peptoids).
PTAs are conformationally restricted, which could pre-organize them for recognition of an RNA target (FIG. 2). Since the most potent first generation compound was a dimer (2H-4),18 we focused on dimers of each assembly scaffold. Compounds were synthesized on solid-phase resin and coupled to an Ht derivative that contains a carboxylate. (Ht binds 5'CUG/3'GUC, and thus is the RNA-binding module.13) It should be noted that all second-generation compounds are soluble in water at ≧10 mM concentration and ≧100 μM concentration in cell culture medium.
Second generation compounds are named 2H-X where 2H indicates two H RNA-binding modules and X is specific for each scaffold. The nomenclature for each scaffold is: (i) polyamines: 2H-P where P indicates the particular polyamine (ED is ethylenediamine; BD is butanediamine; H D is hexanediamine; SPD is spermidine; SPM is spermine); (ii) α-peptides: 2H-nG where nG indicates the number of glycine residues; (iii) α-peptides: 2H-nβA where nβA indicates the number of β-alanine residues; and (iv) PTAs: 2H-nNX where NX indicates the particular N-alkylated spacing module and n indicates the number of modules.
Effect of the Assembly Scaffold on In Vitro Potency.
As mentioned above, DM1 is caused by sequestration of MBNL1 by r(CUG)exp.28, 32-37 Therefore, in vitro potency was determined by measuring displacement of MBNL1 from a r(CUG)12-MBNL1 complex using a time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET) assay.15, 47 Each dimeric compound disrupts the r(CUG)12-MBNL1 complex with IC50's between ˜3 and ˜300 μM (FIG. 3). The most potent compounds are: 2H-SPM, 2H-3G, and 2H-4G. Polyamines and α-peptides (polyglycines) are on average more potent than PTAs and peptoids. This may be due to the presence of imino protons that can favorably interact with the phosphodiester backbone of RNA (FIG. 2).
The spacing between H RNA-binding modules affects in vitro potency by more than an order of magnitude in almost all scaffold classes (FIG. 3), as previously observed.13, 19, 21 For example, 2H-SPM has an IC50 of ˜3 μM while 2H-ED has an IC50 of ˜30 μM. The most potent α-peptides are 2H-3G and 2H-4G (IC50≈3 μM) while 2H-6G is the least potent (IC50≈30 μM). Similar differences are observed for 2H-nβA, 2H-nNMe, and 2H-KnNPr. In summary, the most potent compound in each assembly scaffold class is: polyamines, 2H-SPM; peptides, 2H-3G≈2H-4G (only 2H-3G was further investigated); PTAs, 2H-3NPr, 2H-3NMe, and 2H-K4NPr.
Effect of the Assembly Scaffold on Proteolytic Stability.
We investigated the proteolytic stability of the most potent compound in each class by measuring its susceptibility to pronase digestion at pH 7.8 and pH 9.0 for 18 h.48 The most proteolytically stable compound is 2H-SPM (no observed degradation) while 2H-3NMe is the least stable (completely degraded). Intermediate stability against pronase digestion was observed for the remaining compounds, see Table 1, below.
Proteolytic stability of second and third generation compounds was assessed using pronase as previously described.3 Pronase is a group of 10 proteases isolated from Streptomyces griseus K-1. As such, proteolytic degradation was measured at two pH's, 7.8 and 9.0. Briefly, pronase (1 unit) was added to the compound of interest (400 μM in 40 μL) in 1× Digestion Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 or 9.0, and 10 mM CaCl2), and the reaction was incubated at 37° C. for 18 h. Reactions were quenched by addition of 4 μL of 25% acetic acid, and the products of the pronase digestion were analyzed by HPLC. A linear gradient of 0-100% methanol in H2O with 0.1% (v/v) TFA and a flow rate of 1 mL/min were employed. Results are summarized in Table 1.

Effect of the Assembly Scaffold on Bioactivity.
The best compound from each scaffold class was studied for improving DM1-associated defects in two DM1 cellular models (FIGS. 4A & C and 8). As mentioned above, sequestration of MBNL1 by r(CUG)exp causes alternative pre-mRNA splicing defects.28, 32-34 Therefore, we studied the MBNL-regulated alternative splicing of exon 5 of cardiac troponin T (cTNT) pre-mRNA.49, 50 HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a DM1 mini-gene that encodes r(CUG)exp and a cTNT mini-gene45, 51 followed by treatment with 10 μM compound. In the absence of r(CUG)exp, the exon 5 inclusion rate is ˜45% while in the presence of r(CUG)exp, the exon 5 inclusion rate is ˜85% (FIGS. 4A &B). Interestingly, not all of the compounds tested improve the cTNT pre-mRNA splicing defect (FIG. 4B). There is some correlation between in vitro potency and improvement of splicing defects (FIGS. 3 & 4B). Based on in vitro potency, one would predict the following in vivo potencies: 2H-3G=2H-SPM>2H-3NPr>2H-3NMe≈2H-K4NPr. Although these trends are generally observed, 2H-K4NPr is an outlier as it is actually the most potent in vivo for improving the cTNT-splicing defect.
Next, compounds were studied for improving translational defects associated with DM1 (due to poor nucleocytoplasmic transport of r(CUG)exp-containing transcripts).38-40 In particular, a cellular model system was employed in which the C2C12 cell line stably expresses r(CUG)800 embedded in the 3' UTR of firefly luciferase.18 Akin to DMPK mRNA in DM1-affected cells, the expanded repeat impairs nucleocytoplasmic transport of luciferase mRNA and thus decreases luciferase expression. Compounds that bind r(CUG)exp and disrupt the r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 complex may stimulate cytoplasmic transport of the luciferase mRNA and thus translation of luciferase (FIG. 4C). A significant increase in luciferase activity (and hence improvement of the DM1-associated translational defect) is observed for all compounds (FIG. 4D). There is little difference between the potencies of the compounds, with 2H-SPM having less improvement than the others. Importantly, the compounds do not affect luciferase activity of cells that stably express firefly luciferase mRNA without r(CUG)800 (10 μM compound).
Effect of the Assembly Scaffold on Cellular Permeability and Toxicity.
Next, we studied the effect of the assembly scaffold on cellular permeability and toxicity by flow cytometry (FIG. 9). Permeability was monitored by using the intrinsic fluorescence of the H module while toxicity was measured by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Cells were treated with 1 or 10 μM compound for 24 h and then analyzed. There is little difference in the cellular permeability or toxicity of second-generation compounds when dosed with 10 μM compound (FIG. 9), with the exception of 2H-SPM, which shows significant toxicity. Cellular permeability does not change at 1 μM dosage, except for 2H-SPM, which is reduced by 50%. Taken together, permeability and toxicity data suggest that polyamines may be sub-optimal modular assembly scaffolds. With the exception of 2H-SPM, all compounds are more cell permeable and less toxic than the parent compound, 2H-4, when cells are treated with 1 μM compound (FIG. 9). It has been shown that N-alkylated glycines such as peptoids and PTAs enter cells in greater amounts than peptides52, 53 and that structurally constrained peptides are more cell permeable than their unstructured counterparts.54-57
Effect of N-Alkyl Side Chains in PTAs.
Considering all in vivo data, the optimal compound is 2H-K4NPr (FIGS. 3, 4, and 9). It most effectively improves splicing defects (FIG. 4B), has comparable activity for improving translational defects (FIG. 4D), is highly cell permeable and has low toxicity (FIG. 9), and is proteolytically (and likely metabolically48) stable. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the spacing module in 2H-K4NPr on bioactivity. Specifically, the influences of N-alkylation and α-carbon substitution were studied (FIG. 5A). Previous studies have shown that the spacing module affects affinity, potency, cellular permeability, and localization.20
In vitro potencies were determined using the TR-FRET assay described above. IC50 values ranged from 20 to 55 μM. The N-methyl PTA, 2H-K4NMe, is most potent while 2H-K4NiBu is least potent (FIG. 5B). This suggests that bulky substituents may hinder tight association between r(CUG)12 and the small molecule. Interestingly, 2H-K4NH and 2H-K4NiBu are proteolytically unstable (Table 1).
The compounds were assessed for improving DM1-associated pre-mRNA splicing defects when cells are dosed at 10 μM. The most efficacious compounds are the parent 2H-K4NPr and 2H-K4NH (no tertiary amide) followed by 2H-K4NMe and 2H-K4 (no substituent on the α-C); 2H-K4Bu is inactive. The 2H-K4NPr derivatives were also evaluated for improving translational defects using the luciferase reporter system. All derivatives significantly increase luciferase expression to a similar extent when cells are treated with 10 μM compound. Next, the cellular permeability and toxicity of each 2H-K4NPr derivative were determined via flow cytometry (FIG. 5E). As observed for second-generation compounds, there is little difference in permeability when cells are dosed with 10 μM compound with the exception of 2H-K4, a peptoid. A marked difference is observed for 2H-K4 and third generation compounds at the 1 μM dosage as the other derivatives (peptides and PTAs) are ˜4 times more permeable. In general, little toxicity is observed for 2H-K4NPr derivatives with the exception of 2H-K4NiBu, which has significant toxicity at both 1 and 10 μM, and 2H-K4, which shows some toxicity when cells are treated with 10 μM compound. (FIG. 5E).
In summary, iBu substitution is disadvantageous for bioactivity, rendering the compound inactive in both cellular assays (FIGS. 5C & D) and increasing cellular toxicity (FIG. 5E). Substitution of Pr with H or Me is better tolerated, although Me substitution decreases improvement of splicing defects (FIG. 5C). In contrast, 2H-K4NH has comparable activity as 2H-K4NPr as assessed by restoring pre-mRNA splicing patterns. Cellular permeability and toxicity are similar for 2H-K4NPr, 2H-K4NMe, and 2H-K4NH. Removal of the methyl group on the α-carbon, affording 2H-K4, negatively affects cellular permeability (FIG. 5E).
Further Analysis of 2H-K4NPr and 2H-K4NMe.
We further investigated 2H-K4NPr and 2H-K4NMe based on their abilities to improve DM1-associated defects and because of their greater cell permeabilities (FIG. 5E) and proteolytic/metabolic stabilities (Table 1) than 2H-K4NH and 2H-K4. First, a dose response for improvement of pre-mRNA splicing defects was measured. Both compounds improve the cTNT splicing defect at 5 μM but not at 1 μM. Interestingly, 2H-K4NMe is slightly better than 2H-K4NPr at this concentration (FIG. 26). Neither compound affects cTNT splicing in cells that do not express r(CUG)exp.
A dose response for improving translational defects was also completed for 2H-K4NMe. Significant activity was observed when cells were treated with as little as 1 μM compound (FIG. 26). Both 2H-K4NPr and 2H-K4NMe appear to improve alternative pre-mRNA splicing and translational defects at concentrations somewhat less than their in vitro IC50s. These observations could be due to: (i) in vitro and in vive assays measure very different phenomena: inhibition of the r(CUG)-MBNL1 interaction (in vitro) as compared to the activity of free MBNL1 (in vivo); (ii) a small effect on the translational defect is also observed for the PTA backbone (K4NMe; FIG. 26); and (iii) a recent study by Jog et al. reported that once a critical threshold of MBNL1 concentration is achieved, relatively small changes in the amount of active MBNL1 significantly affects the number and severity of splicing defects.58 For example, when MBNL1 levels are unaffected, the percentage of cTNT exon 5 inclusion is 49.5%. When MBNL1 levels are decreased by 79%, 87%, 97%, and 98% via siRNA knock-down, the percentages of exon inclusion are 48.2% (no change as compared to cells treated with a scrambled siRNA), 54.3%, 81.5%, and 88.4%.58 It should be noted that these. effects are unique for each pre-mRNA substrate.58 Taking together activity, stability, toxicity, and ease of synthesis, 2H-K4NMe is more ideal than 2H-K4NPr.
Additional control experiments were completed with 2H-K4NMe. To ensure that alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs not regulated by MBNL1 are unaffected, we studied the alternative splicing of pleckstrin homology domain containing, family H member 2 (PLEKHH2) using a mini-gene construct.45 Splicing of PLEKHH2 was not affected at 10 μM, demonstrating 2H-K4NMe's selectivity for r(CUG)exp and alternative pre-mRNA splice events regulated by MBNL1. Moreover, the unconjugated PTA backbone, K4NMe, shows little activity in the translational assay (FIG. 26).
The binding of 2H-K4NMe to various RNAs including r(CUG)12, r(CAG)12, r(AU)12 and r(GC)8 was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry. The effect of assembly scaffold composition on cellular permeability and toxicity was examined. HeLa cells were treated with 10 μM and 1 μM compound for 24 h. Toxicity was assessed by staining with propidium iodide (PI). All second generation compounds have improved permeability compared to the parent compound 2H-4. Compounds with peptide and PTA scaffolds had the greatest cell uptake with little toxicity. Gates for positive staining were created in relation to untreated, unstained cells; untreated, PI stained cells; and Hoechst 33258 treated cells. In summary, 211-K4NMe is selective for r(CUG)12 by ˜30-100-fold over the other RNAs studied (Table 2). In general, it has a faster association rate (kon) and a slower dissociation rate (koff) when binding to r(CUG)12 compared to the other RNAs.
The kinetic parameters for 2H-K4NMe binding to r(CUG)12 show that this compound has advantages over the monomeric RNA binding module and MBNL1 (Table 2).

For example, H binds r(CUG)12 with a Kd of 2000 nM, or 15-fold weaker than 2H-K4NMe. Previous studies show that 2H-4 only had an affinity bonus of 1.5-fold compared to monomer.13 The increased affinity of 2H-K4NMe could be due to improved interactions of the PTA scaffold with the RNA or to the more pre-organized nature of the PTA backbone. PTAs have limited flexibility due to 1,3-allylic strain introduced by the substituents on both the α-carbon and the imino nitrogen and thus sample less conformational space when finding the optimal binding mode for r(CUG)12.
The secondary structures of the RNAs used in these studies are given in FIG. 10. Additionally, the kon and koff rates are 10-fold faster and 10-fold slower for 2H-K4NMe than H, suggesting a hinge effect (FIG. 10) provides benefits for both the rates of complex formation and complex dissociation for modularly assembled compounds. 2H-K4NMe binds 5-fold more tightly to r(CUG)12 than MBNL1 does. High affinity binding is advantageous for compounds that target r(CUG)exp as lower concentrations of compound are likely to be required for bioactivity, thus minimizing potential non-specific effects at efficacious doses. 2H-K4NMe also has kinetic advantages for binding r(CUG)12 over MBNL1 as its on rate is 79-fold faster than MBNL1's (Table 2).
These binding kinetic observations may be due to the nature in which the small molecule and MBNL1 bind to RNA targets. As a regulator of alternative splicing, MBNL1 must interact specifically with RNA and does so via four zinc finger (ZnF) domains. A crystal structure of the ZnF3/4 domain complexed with two copies of single stranded r(CGCUGU) was recently reported.59 Both zinc fingers interact with one molecule of RNA with ZnF3 forming contacts to the 5'GC step and ZnF4 forming contacts to 5'GCU. The RNA molecules are oriented antiparallel to each other. These results suggest that MBNL1 binding induces a chain-reversal trajectory and unzipping of the bound RNA. It is likely that MBNL1 opens the r(CUG) hairpin stem to afford two single stranded regions, which is supported by the fact that MBNL1 binds weakly to fully base-paired RNAs. The increased on rate for the designer small molecule onto r(CUG)exp may be a consequence of such molecular recognition. That is, the small molecule binds the native hairpin structure of r(CUG)exp and stabilizes it whereas MBNL1 initially interacts with r(CUG)exp, then disrupts or remodels the hairpin structure to afford the final bound conformation.
Identifying the Cellular Targets of 2H-K4NMe.
The cellular targets of the optimal r(CUG)exp-targeting compound were identified using a modified version of a pull down experiment (FIG. 6). Briefly, a biotinylated 2H-K4NMe derivative (2H-K4NMe-Biotin) was synthesized and anchored onto streptavidin resin to afford an affinity purification matrix. Total RNA was extracted from a DM1 cellular model and incubated with the affinity matrix. After extensive washing, northern blotting revealed that r(CUG)exp is highly enriched in the eluted RNA bound by 2H-K4NMe-Biotin (FIG. 6). Interestingly, r(CUG)exp was not pulled down by streptavidin beads that display an oligonucleotide complementary to r(CUG)exp, 5'-biotin-d(CAG)12. This is likely due to the highly structured nature of the r(CUG)exp target.8, 25, 27, 60-62 Since oligonucleotides recognize sequence, formation of a duplex between r(CUG)exp and a complementary oligonucleotide can only occur after the intramolecular structure is unfolded, a significant barrier for complex formation. Small molecules that recognize structure would not have this barrier for binding to highly structured RNA targets.
2H-K4NMe Improves Splicing Defects in a Mouse Model of DM1.
2H-K4NMe was selected for animal studies based on overall performance in cell-based assays, increased proteolytic stability as compared to 2H-KNH and decreased structural complexity compared to 2H-K4NPr. A mouse model of DM1 has been reported in which 250 rCUG repeats are expressed using an actin promoter (human skeletal actin long repeat, HSALR).24 The presence of these repeats results in dysregulation of alternative splicing in the muscle-specific chloride ion channel (Clcn1) and the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 1 (Serca1/Atp2a1) pre-mRNAs. Clcn1 exon 7a is excluded ˜100% in mRNA from normal adult mice; DM1 mice have an exclusion rate of ˜50%. After DM1 mice were treated for 7 days with 100 mg/kg/d of 2H-K4NMe, the exclusion rate of exon 7A was restored to 71% (p-value=0.007) (FIGS. 7 and 11). Mis-splicing of Serca1 exon 21 was also partially rescued. The exon 22 inclusion rate is ˜100% in normal adult mice and ˜11.8% in DM1 mice. After treatment with 2H-K4NMe, the inclusion rate increases to 21.5% (p-value=0.008). Importantly, 2H-K4NMe did not affect the alternative splicing of Itgb1 and CapZB mRNAs, which are not regulated by MBNL1.
Summary and Outlook.
In this study we investigated the role of the modularly assembly scaffold on in vitro and in vivo activities of compounds designed to target the RNA that causes myotonic dystrophy type 1. Based on a variety of criteria, including in vitro and in vive potency, proteolytic stability, cellular permeability, and toxicity, the optimal scaffold is a PTA. Importantly, a kinetics investigation showed that modularly assembled small molecules have faster on rates and slower off rates than monomeric small molecules or MBNL1 protein, perhaps owing to a hinge effect to difference in the nature of the binding of small molecule and protein to r(CUG)exp. These kinetic advantages likely explain the potent biological effects of our divalent compounds, as the RNA-binding modules from which they are composed of by themselves are inactive. Such effects can be programmed into designer small molecules targeting other cellular RNAs.
In addition, we leveraged the chemistry allowed by a modular assembly approach to incorporate a biotin tag. This modification allowed the pull down of cellular targets of a small molecule using streptavidin beads and demonstrated that r(CUG)exp is indeed a target of our designed compounds. This is the first study that identified r(CUG)exp as a cellular target of small molecules that improve DM1-associated defects and further supports our design strategy. Other tags can be incorporated into modularly assembled compounds including warheads for targeted cleavage or covalent cross-linking.63, 64 Importantly, our optimal compound improves DM1-associated alternative splicing defects in a mouse model and thus has therapeutic potential.

Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) Assay.
Initial in vitro activity of modularly assembled compounds was assessed by disruption of the r(CUG)exp-MBNL1 complex using a previously reported TR-FRET assay.15, 47 The ratio of fluorescence intensity of 545 and 665 nm in the presence and absence of compound were used to calculate percent inhibition. The resulting curves were fit to the following equation to determine IC50 values:
y=B+A-B1+(IC50x)hillslope
where y is the ratio of fluorescence intensities at 545 nm and 665 nm (F545/F665), x is the concentration of small molecule, B is the F545/F665 ratio reflective of the maximum amount of FRET observed (absence of small molecule); A is the F545/F665 ratio reflective of the minimum amount of FRET observed (absence of RNA, protein, and small molecule; only antibodies are present); and the IC50 is the concentration of small molecule where half of the protein is displaced by small molecule.
Improvement of DM1-Associated Splicing Defects in a DM1 Cell Culture Model Using RT-PCR.
DM1-associated alternative pre-mRNA splicing defects were assessed using a previously reported model system.45 Briefly, HeLa cells were grown as monolayers in 96-well plates in growth medium (1×DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1× Glutamax (Invitrogen)). Cells were transfected at 90-95% confluency with 200 ng of total plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's standard protocol. Equal amounts of plasmid expressing a DM1 mini-gene with 960 interrupted CTG repeats51 and a mini-gene of interest (cTNT61 or PLEKHH245) were used. After 5 h, the transfection cocktail was removed and replaced with growth medium containing the compound of interest. After 20-24 h, the cells were lysed, and total RNA was harvested using a Sigma-Aldrich GeneElute total mammalian RNA miniprep kit. An on-column DNA digestion was completed per the manufacturer's recommended protocol. A sample of RNA was subjected to RT-PCR as previously described.15
Improvement of DM1-Associated Translational Defects Using a Luciferase Model System.
C2C12 cell lines expressing 800 or 0 CTG repeats in the 3' UTR of luciferase were grown as monolayers in 96-well plates in growth medium (1×DMEM, 10% FBS, 1× Glutamax, (Invitrogen) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (MP Biomedicals LLC)). After 24 h, the compound of interest was added in 50 μL of growth medium. Cells were treated with compound for 24 h. Luciferase activity was determined as previously described.18
Treatment in Mice.
All experimental procedures, mouse handling, and husbandry were completed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. A mouse model for DM1, HSALR in line 20b, was used.24 HSALR mice express human skeletal actin RNA with 250 CUG repeats in the 3' UTR. Age- and gender-matched HSALR mice were injected intraperitoneally with 100 mg/kg 2H-K4NMe in water for treatment or 0.9% NaCl for control once per day for 7 days. Mice were sacrificed one day after the last injection, and the vastus muscle was obtained. RNA was extracted from the vastus tissue, and cDNA was synthesized as previously described.65

Description of Cellular Permeability and Toxicity Studies
HeLa cells were grown in 12-well plates in growth medium (1×DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1× Glutamax (Invitrogen)) for 24 h until they reached 90-95% confluency. The growth medium was removed and replaced with 750 μL of fresh medium containing the compound of interest. Cells were treated for 24 h and then washed with 1×DPBS. The cells were trypsinized, pelleted, and washed twice with ice-cold 1×DPBS. Cells were resuspended in 1×DPBS containing 1 μg/mL propidium iodide (Sigma Aldrich) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Analysis of 10,000 events was completed using a BD LSRII flow cytometer using standard forward and side scatter metrics. Cells were compared to controls treated with medium alone. Propidium iodide staining was used to detect cells that are grossly intact but are permeabilized. PI was detected using a 561 nm laser. Hoechst 33258 was used as a positive control for gating 2H-X compounds. H was detected using a UV laser (355 nm).

After staining, the gel was destained in 0.5×TBE buffer for 30 min and then imaged with a Bio-Rad molecular imager gel doc XR+ imaging system.
The RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham) according to the manufacturer's capillary blotting protocol using 20×SSC (3M NaCl, 300 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0). The transferred RNA was then crosslinked to the membrane by placing the membrane in a Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400 (120,000 μjoules to 0 μjoules in 30 s). The membrane was washed with boiling 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 37° C. The blot was then hybridized with a 32P labeled d(CAG)10 probe (10 million counts) in 1× Hybridization Buffer (7.5×Denhart's solution, 5×SSPE, and 0.1% SDS) for 18 h at 37° C. Excess probe was removed by washing with Wash Solution 1 (5×SSPE, 0.1% SDS) followed by washing at 37° C. with Wash Solution 2 (0.5×SSPE, 0.1% SDS) 2×10 min. Additional washing with Wash Solution 1 was continued until radioactivity of the wash solution reached background levels. The membrane was air dried and imaged using a Molecular Dynamics Typhoon 9410 variable mode imager.

PCR amplification was carried out for 26-30 cycles with the following primer pairs: Clcn1 forward 5'-TGAAGGAATACCTCACACTCAAGG (SEQ ID NO:5) and reverse 5'-(6FAM)CACGGAACACAAAGGCACTG (SEQ IDNO:6); Secra1 forward 5'-(6FAM)CTCATGGTCCTCAAGATCTCAC (SEQ ID NO:7) and reverse 5'-GGGTCAGTGCCTCAGCTTTG (SEQ ID NO:8). The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was scanned with a laser fluorimager (Typhoon, GE Healthcare), and the products were quantified using ImageQuant.
