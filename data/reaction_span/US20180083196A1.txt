CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0120139, filed on Sep. 20, 2016, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and entitled: “Condensed Cyclic Compound and Organic Light-Emitting Device Including the Same,” is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
Embodiments relate to a compound for an organic light-emitting device and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that produce full-color images, having wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, and short response times, as well as excellent brightness, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics as compared with devices in the art.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transition from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.

Synthesis Example 1: Synthesis of Compound 4
Synthesis of Intermediate A
Under an Ar atmosphere, 8.65 g of 1,8-dibromonaphthalene, 3.69 g of phenylboronic acid, 1.75 g of Pd(PPh3)4, and 3.55 g of K2CO3 were dissolved in a mixed solvent containing 90 mL of water and 300 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and then refluxed and stirred for 6 hours in a 500-mL three-neck flask. An organic layer obtained therefrom was dried by using MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue obtained therefrom was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography, thereby completing the preparation of 5.23 g (61%) of Intermediate A. A molecular weight of the prepared Intermediate A was measured to be 283 by MS/FAB.
Synthesis of Intermediate B
1.00 g of Intermediate A was dissolved in 45 mL of dehydrated THF and stirred at a temperature of −78° C. in a 200-mL three-neck flask. 2.65 mL of 1.6 M n-BuLi (in a hexane solvent) was added dropwise thereinto and stirred for 2 hours. Then, 35 mL of a THF solution containing 1.10 g of 3-bromobenzophenone was added dropwise thereinto and then further stirred at ambient temperature for 3 hours. A 1N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution was added to the mixed solution and stirred for 1 hour, and a washing process was performed thereon by using water. A solvent of an organic layer obtained therefrom was evaporated to obtain a white solid. The obtained white solid, 50 mL of AcOH, and 0.6 mL of hydrochloric acid were added to a 200-mL three-neck flask and heated and stirred at a temperature of 130° C. for 2 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained mixed solution was added dropwise into 100 mL of cold water to obtain a white crystal. The obtained white crystal was washed by using MeOH and then dried, thereby completing the preparation of 1.26 g (80%) of Intermediate B. A molecular weight of the prepared Intermediate B was measured to be 447 by MS/FAB.

After the stirred solution was cooled, an organic layer obtained therefrom was dried by using MgSO4, and a solvent was evaporated. The residue obtained therefrom was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography, thereby completing the preparation of 2.13 g (90%) of Compound 4. The prepared Compound 4 was identified by MS/FAB and 1H NMR.

After the stirred solution was cooled, an organic layer was separated by adding water thereto, and a solvent was evaporated. The residue obtained therefrom was separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (a mixed solution containing toluene and hexane was used), thereby completing the preparation of 4.31 g (90%) of Intermediate C as a faintly yellow solid. A molecular weight of the prepared Intermediate C was measured to be 479 by MS/FAB.
Synthesis of Compound 10
