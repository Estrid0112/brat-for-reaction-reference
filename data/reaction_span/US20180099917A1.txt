TECHNICAL FIELD
The presently-disclosed subject matter generally relates to highly soluble, stable, reversibly reducible materials and methods of use thereof. In particular, certain embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter relate to negolytes for use in redox-flow batteries and methods of forming such negolytes.
BACKGROUND
Redox flow batteries (RFBs), which function by storing electrochemical energy in liquid electrolyte formulations, are promising technologies for energy storage on medium to large scales. Since the energy is stored in a liquid form, increasing the capacity of RFBs is largely a matter of increasing the size of active-material storage tanks, or increasing the concentration of the active component (which requires improved solubility in the electrolyte solution). While existing RFBs based upon aqueous vanadium chemistry are robust and long-lived, they rely upon expensive transition metals as active materials that form redox active species. Additionally, these RFBs are aqueous-based and, therefore, are limited by the electrochemical stability window of water (about 1.5 V).
One possibility for accessing higher voltages includes the use of non-aqueous electrolytes, which are generally not compatible with transition metal-based active materials. Although such systems have the potential for increasing the voltage of the system and reducing cost by exchanging scarce transition metals for plentiful carbon-based materials, the development and commercialization of organic non-aqueous redox flow batteries is largely in its infancy due to challenges in long term stability, atom economy, and solubility/energy density.
Accordingly, there exists a need for stable electroactive materials having sufficient atom economy, electrochemical reversibility, and solubility for use in redox flow batteries.

In some embodiments, modifying the Z group in formula I above adjusts the solubility of the resulting compound. For example, in one embodiment, compound number 1 has a solubility of 0.1 M in acetonitrile (electrolyte solution), while compound number 2 has a solubility of 0.3 M in acetonitrile. In certain embodiments, adding a second group on the N atom increases the solubility of the compound. For example, compound number 11, where X is CH2CH3, has a solubility of 0.7 M in acetonitrile, which is substantially higher than that of compound numbers 1 and 2, where X is H. The second group on the N atom in compound number 11 also provides excellent electrochemistry properties. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, a halogen in the R5 position increases the solubility of the compound. For example, inserting Cl at the R5 position, as in compound number 10, increases the solubility as compared to compound 2, which is the identical compound without Cl at the R5 position.
In some embodiments, the compound includes both an anolyte and a catholyte in the same molecule. For example, in compound numbers 14 and 15, the nitrogen-containing cycles are part of a ring system that is a well-known anolyte material. In certain embodiments, such compounds may form a one-molecule redox flow battery (RFB). In some embodiments, the water-solubilizing functionality may be shifted from the quinone core to the nitrogen side, such as, for example, in compound numbers 16-18. Referring to compound number 13, in some embodiments, the compound is a liquid. In one embodiment, the liquid compound provides a solvent-free version of an RFB. In another embodiment, the solvent-free version of the RFB provides substantially higher power density as compared to RFBs including solvents.
The reversibly reducible material according to one or more of the embodiments disclosed herein is soluble in at least one solvent for redox flow batteries. Accordingly, also provided herein is a negolyte for use in redox-flow batteries, the negolyte including the reversibly reducible material and a redox flow battery solvent. Such solvents include, but are not limited to, acetonitrile, propylene glycol, propylene carbonate, dimethyl acetamide, and dimethyl formamide. For example, the methoxyethyl derivative has shown good solubility in acetonitrile and excellent electrochemical reversibility. In some embodiments, the negolyte also includes an electrolyte. Suitable electrolytes include, but are not limited to, tetraalkylammonium hexafluorophosphate, perchlorate, tetrafluoroborate, triflate, perfluorobutylsulfonate, lithium salts thereof (e.g., lithium hexafluorophosphate or perchlorate), other organic-soluble materials, any other suitable electrolyte, or a combination thereof. Other suitable electrolytes include, but are not limited to, sulfuric acid and/or potassium hydroxide. An example of the electrochemical trace, with internal ferrocene standard in acetonitrile using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate electrolyte, is shown in FIG. 1. Although discussed above with regard to non-aqueous redox flow batteries, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art the instant disclosure is not so limited and may include aqueous redox flow batteries as well.
In certain embodiments, the negolyte includes a high concentration of the reversibly reducible material(s) disclosed herein. For example, in one embodiment, the negolyte includes a reversibly reducible material concentration of at least 0.5 M, at least 1.0 M, at least 1.5 M, at least 2.0 M, between 0.5 and 2.0 M, or any combination, sub-combination, range, or sub-range thereof, along with a similar concentration of electrolyte. Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, the reversibly reducible material(s) provide stable double reduction without or substantially without significantly increasing molecular weight. The increased charge storage (i.e., double-reduction) and/or increased solubility of the reversibly reducible material(s) disclosed herein increase the electronic capacity of the negolyte. In another embodiment, the negolyte provides an increased range of operating temperature as compared to existing negolytes. For example, solvents such as acetonitrile, which has a melting point of −45° C. and a boiling point of 82° C. may facilitate low-temperature operation, while solvents such as propylene carbonate, which has a melting point of −49° C. and a boiling point of 242° C. may facilitate both low- and high-temperature operation.
Additionally provided herein, is a method of forming a reversibly reducible material comprising reacting a quinone with an amine in an ethereal solvent. In one embodiment, the method comprises reacting a 1,4-naphthoquinone and an amine in a tetrahydrofuran solvent according to the following reaction:
<img> id-US20180099917A1-20180412-C00030.TIF </img>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the solvent is not limited to tetrahydrofuran and may include any other suitable ethereal solvent, such as, but not limited to, dioxane, diethyl ether, glyme, other non-nucleophilic amines such as Hünig's base, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the triethylamine in the reaction above may be replaced by a three-fold excess of amine.
The presently-disclosed subject matter is further illustrated by the following specific but non-limiting examples. The following examples may include compilations of data that are representative of data gathered at various times during the course of development and experimentation related to the presently-disclosed subject matter.
EXAMPLES
Example 1
For scalable synthesis, reagents must be inexpensive, the reaction high-yielding, and purification methods must be simple and scalable. Many methods reported in the literature are not appropriate for synthesizing the reversibly reducible materials disclosed herein. For example, one method includes reacting 2-bromo 1,4-naphthoquinone with an amine group, as shown in the reaction below:
<img> id-US20180099917A1-20180412-C00031.TIF </img>
However, when 2-bromo 1,4-naphthoquinone is reacted with an amine group it produces substantial quantities (>15%) of the brominated product, which can be difficult to separate from the desired material. While there are also several literature reports of successful amination of naphthoquinones simply by stirring a suspension of naphthoquinone with the amine in water, none of those experiments could be reproduced by the instant inventors.
Accordingly, the instant inventors developed an efficient route to the desired materials, which, as shown below, includes stirring the quinone and amine (in slight excess) in tetrahydrofuran solvent open to air for 24 to 72 hours.
<img> id-US20180099917A1-20180412-C00032.TIF </img>
This approach has produced high yields of pure product on scales up to 5 grams, has been demonstrated to work on a wide variety of amines (both primary and secondary), and has yielded materials with minimal need for further purification. Other ethereal solvents, such as dioxane, diethyl ether, or glyme, and other non-nucleophilic amines such as Hünig's base, are also believed to function in this reaction scheme. In cases where the desired amine is inexpensive, a simple 3-fold excess of amine can be utilized in place of added triethylamine.
In more specific examples, following the procedure above using a THF solvent, where X=methoxyethyl and Z=H, the yield was 75%; where X=ethyl and Z=ethyl, the yield was 80%; where X=methoxyethyl and Z=methoxyethyl, the yield was 80%; where X=(CH2CH2O)3CH3 and Z=H, the yield was 70%. Additionally, for a morpholine adduct, where X and Z are connected through a CH2CH2OCH2CH2 bridge, the yield was 65%.
Example 2
Following the formation of reversibly reducible materials as discussed above, various compounds were tested for structure, solubility, and reduction potentials. The results are provided in Table 2 below, with solubility shown in acetonitrile at 23° C. and reduction potentials shown versus ferrocene.
