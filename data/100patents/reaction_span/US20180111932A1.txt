FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides naphthyridinone compounds, the use thereof for inhibiting GIRK 1/4 channel and methods of treating diseases using same.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
A normal cardiac cycle begins in the sino-atrial node, which produces an excitatory electrical stimulus that propagates in an orderly fashion throughout the atrial and ventricular myocardium to induce a contraction (systole). At the cellular level, the excitatory electrical impulse triggers the cardiac action potential. This is characterized by an initial, rapid membrane depolarization followed by a plateau phase and subsequent repolarization to return to resting membrane potential. The cardiac action potential governs signal propagation throughout the heart. For example, the rate of initial cellular depolarization determines the velocity at which excitatory stimuli propagate. The duration of the repolarization phase determines the action potential duration (APD) and the refractory period, or time in which a cardiomyocyte cannot respond to another electrical stimulus.
Abnormalities in the cardiac action potential are associated with arrhythmia. For example, excessive reduction of action potential duration and the associated refractory period can provide a substrate for so-called re-entrant tachyarrhythmia. In this condition, instead of propagating normally, a cardiac impulse feeds back upon itself via excitable tissue to form a re-entrant circuit (Waldo and Wit, 1993. Mechanism of cardiac arrhythmias. Lancet 341, 1189-1193). Existing class III anti-arrhythmic drugs are thought to work by lengthening the APD and associated effective refractory period (ERP), thereby minimizing the risk of re-excitation and subsequent formation of fibrillatory re-entry circuits (Singh B. N. and Vaughan Williams, E. M., 1970. A third class of anti-arrhythmic action. Effects on atrial and ventricular intracellular potentials, and other pharmacological actions on cardiac muscle, of MJ 1999 and AH3474. British Journal of pharmacology 39, 675-687).
Certain class III anti-arrhythmic drugs (e.g. sotalol) are used in the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is the most common form of sustained cardiac arrhythmia in humans and is characterized by fibrillatory contractions that compromise atrial function. AF is associated with adverse cardiovascular events. In particular, the presence of AF is an independent risk factor for thromboembolic stroke, heart failure and all-cause mortality (Estes et al., (2008). Journal of the American College of Cardiology 51, 865-884) (Fang et al., 2008. Comparison of risk stratification schemes to predict thromboembolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Journal of the American College of Cardiology 51, 810-815). AF can also reduce quality of life in some patients by inducing palpitations and reducing exercise tolerance (Thrall et al., 2006. Quality of life in patients with atrial fibrillation: a systematic review. The American journal of medicine 119, 448.e441-419). The goal of anti-arrhythmic therapy for AF is to avoid these adverse effects and outcomes.
A drawback of existing Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs is that they act to prolong effective refractory period in both atria and ventricles. Excessive prolongation in ventricular tissue lengthens QTc interval and can be pro-arrhythmic, and certain drugs with this mechanism of action (e.g. dofetilide) are known to induce potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as Torsades de Pointes (Redfern et al., 2003. Relationships between preclinical cardiac electrophysiology, clinical QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes for a broad range of drugs: evidence for a provisional safety margin in drug development. Cardiovascular research 58, 32-45). There is thus a need for a novel anti-arrhythmic therapy for AF that targets atrial, and not ventricular, tissue selectively.
The configuration and duration of the cardiac action potential is controlled at the cellular level by the action of multiple different transmembrane ion channels. For example, the initial depolarization phase is mediated by influx of sodium ions via the cardiac-specific Nav1.5 channel. Potassium channels are responsible for the latter phase of repolarization, and thus help regulate the overall duration of the action potential. Indeed, class III anti-arrhythmic drugs that target potassium channels (e.g. dofetilide) prolong both action potential duration and effective refractory period. There are several different varieties of transmembrane potassium channel (Schmitt et al., 2014. Cardiac potassium channel subtypes: new roles in repolarization and arrhythmia. Physiological reviews 94, 609-653; Tamargo et al., 2004. Pharmacology of cardiac potassium channels. Cardiovascular research 62, 9-33), including:Voltage-gated channels (Kv1-9)Calcium-activated channels (KCa1-2)Tandem pore domain channels (e.g. TASK)Inwardly rectifying channels (Kir1-6)
While most cardiac potassium channels contribute to repolarization in both atrial and ventricular tissues in humans, two-Kv1.5 and GIRK1/4 (i.e. G-protein regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channel 1/4)-are thought to be expressed solely in atria (Gaborit et al., 2007. Regional and tissue specific transcript signatures of ion channel genes in the non-diseased human heart. The Journal of physiology 582, 675-693). This atrial-specific pattern of expression makes these particularly attractive targets for novel anti-arrhythmic therapies for AF, as they should not have the adverse ventricular effects of existing Class III drugs such as dofetilide.
Mammals express four different GIRK channels (GIRK 1, 2, 3 and 4; encoded by KCNJ3, KCNJ6, KCNJ9 and KCNJ5, respectively). These transmembrane spanning proteins are arranged as tetramers (either homo or heterotetramers) to form a functional potassium channel (Krapivinsky et al., 1995. The G-protein-gated atrial K+ channel IKACh is a heteromultimer of two inwardly rectifying K(+)-channel proteins. Nature 374, 135-141). These channels are ligand-gated (i.e. regulated by binding of ligands to Gi-protein coupled receptors present in the same cell membrane). For example, the GIRK1/4 channel is a heterotetramer (two subunits each of GIRK1 and GIRK4) expressed strongly in sino-atrial and atrioventricular nodes as well as the atrial myocardium (Wickman et al., 1999. Structure, G protein activation, and functional relevance of the cardiac G protein-gated K+ channel, IKACh. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 868, 386-398). One function of this channel is to mediate autonomic regulation of heart rate. Acetylcholine released upon parasympathetic stimulation of cardiac vagal efferent neurons binds to Gi-coupled M2 muscarinic receptors in heart. This liberates Gβγ subunits, which in turn open GIRK1/4 channels to permit efflux of potassium from cardiomyocytes and so promote membrane repolarization. In the spontaneously depolarizing pacemaking cells of the sino-atrial node, the magnitude of this repolarization dictates the timing between depolarizations, and hence heart rate. Because it is regulated by acetylcholine, the current mediated by GIRK1/4 channels is called IKAch(Wickman et al., 1999).
Several lines of evidence point toward GIRK1/4 as a desirable anti-arrhythmia target for AF. In animals, vagal nerve stimulation promotes acetylcholine release from vagal afferents and an increase in IKAch. This in turn shortens atrial (but not ventricular) action potential duration and effective refractory period and can induce AF via a re-entry mechanism (Hashimoto et al., 2006. Tertiapin, a selective IKACh blocker, terminates atrial fibrillation with selective atrial effective refractory period prolongation. Pharmacological research: the official journal of the Italian Pharmacological Society 54, 136-141). In atrial tissues from humans with persistent AF as well as from animals subjected to atrial rapid pacing (an accepted model for promoting electrical remodeling and susceptibility to AF), IKAch has been shown to be dysregulated. Specifically, the channel tends to be constitutively open, even in the absence of acetylcholine (Cha et al., 2006. Kir3-based inward rectifier potassium current: potential role in atrial tachycardia remodeling effects on atrial repolarization and arrhythmias. Circulation 113, 1730-1737; Voigt et al., 2014. Constitutive activity of the acetylcholine-activated potassium current IK,ACh in cardiomyocytes. Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.) 70, 393-409). In these studies, it is observed in patients and animals that atrial APD/ERP is short. Thus, the development of GIRK1/4 blockers would be beneficial in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation.

In embodiment 16, the invention is a hydrate crystalline form B of Example 1 characterized by a x-ray powder diffraction pattern comprising five or more 2θ values (CuKα λ=1.5418 Å) selected from the group consisting of 14.294±0.2°, 18.666±0.2°, 22.353±0.2°, 24.878±0.2°, 26.163±0.2°, 27.106±0.2°, 27.744±0.2° and 28.228±0.2° measured at a temperature of about 22° C. and an x-ray wavelength, λ, of 1.5418 Å.
In embodiment 17, the invention is a hydrate crystalline form B of Example 1 having an X-ray diffraction spectrum substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction spectrum shown in FIG. 1.
The term “substantially the same” with reference to X-ray diffraction peak positions means that typical peak position and intensity variability are taken into account. For example, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the peak positions (2⊖) will show some inter-apparatus variability, typically as much as 0.2°. Occasionally, the variability could be higher than 0.2° depending on apparatus calibration differences. Further, one skilled in the art will appreciate that relative peak intensities will show inter-apparatus variability as well as variability due to degree of crystallinity, preferred orientation, prepared sample surface, and other factors known to those skilled in the art, and should be taken as qualitative measure only.
In embodiment 18, the invention is a hydrate crystalline form B of Example 1 having a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram substantially the same as that shown in shown in FIG. 2 (with pinhole sample pan) and FIG. 3 (with hermetic sample pan).

Depending on the choice of the starting materials and procedures, the compounds can be present in the form of one of the possible stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof, for example as pure optical isomers, or as stereoisomer mixtures, such as racemates and diastereoisomer mixtures, depending on the number of asymmetric carbon atoms. The present invention is meant to include all such possible stereoisomers, including racemic mixtures, diasteriomeric mixtures and optically pure forms. Optically active (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If the compound contains a double bond, the substituent may be E or Z configuration. If the compound contains a disubstituted cycloalkyl, the cycloalkyl substituent may have a cis- or trans-configuration. All tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.
As used herein, the terms “salt” or “salts” refers to an acid addition or base addition salt of a compound of the invention. “Salts” include in particular “pharmaceutical acceptable salts”. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts that retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the compounds of this invention and, which typically are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. In many cases, the compounds of the present invention are capable of forming acid and/or base salts by virtue of the presence of amino and/or carboxyl groups or groups similar thereto.
Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids.
Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, and the like.

Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number.
Isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include, for example, isotopes of hydrogen.
Further, substitution with heavier isotopes, particularly deuterium (i.e., 2H or D) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements or an improvement in therapeutic index or tolerability. It is understood that deuterium in this context is regarded as a substituent of a compound of the formula (I), (II) or (III). The concentration of deuterium may be defined by the isotopic enrichment factor. The term “isotopic enrichment factor” as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. If a substituent in a compound of this invention is denoted as being deuterium, such compound has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). It should be understood that the term “isotopic enrichment factor” can be applied to any isotope in the same manner as described for deuterium.
Other examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, and chlorine, such as 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18F 31P, 32P, 35S, 36Cl, 123I, 124I, 125I respectively. Accordingly it should be understood that the invention includes compounds that incorporate one or more of any of the aforementioned isotopes, including for example, radioactive isotopes, such as 3H and 14C, or those into which non-radioactive isotopes, such as 2H and 13C are present. Such isotopically labelled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or labeled compound may be particularly desirable for PET or SPECT studies. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagents in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.
Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include those wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.

Pharmaceutical Press, 2013, pp. 1049-1070).
The term “a therapeutically effective amount” of a compound of the present invention refers to an amount of the compound of the present invention that will elicit the biological or medical response of a subject, for example, reduction or inhibition of an enzyme or a protein activity, or ameliorate symptoms, alleviate conditions, slow or delay disease progression, or prevent a disease, etc. In one non-limiting embodiment, the term “a therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of the compound of the present invention that, when administered to a subject, is effective to (1) at least partially alleviate, inhibit, prevent and/or ameliorate a condition, or a disorder or a disease (i) mediated by GIRK1/4 channel, or (ii) associated with GIRK1/4 channel activity, or (iii) characterized by activity (normal or abnormal) of GIRK1/4 channel; or (2) reduce or inhibit the activity of GIRK1/4 channel; or (3) reduce or inhibit the expression of GIRK1/4 channel. In another non-limiting embodiment, the term “a therapeutically effective amount” refers to the amount of the compound of the present invention that, when administered to a cell, or a tissue, or a non-cellular biological material, or a medium, is effective to at least partially reducing or inhibiting the activity of GIRK1/4 channel; or at least partially reducing or inhibiting the expression of GIRK1/4 channel.
As used herein, the term “subject” refers to humans, male or female. In yet other embodiments, the subject is a human.

As used herein, the term “treat”, “treating” or “treatment” of any disease or disorder refers to alleviating or ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., slowing or arresting the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof); or alleviating or ameliorating at least one physical parameter or biomarker associated with the disease or disorder, including those which may not be discernible to the patient.
As used herein, the term “prevent”, “preventing” or “prevention” of any disease or disorder refers to the prophylactic treatment of the disease or disorder; or delaying the onset or progression of the disease or disorder.
As used herein, the term “a,” “an,” “the” and similar terms used in the context of the present invention (especially in the context of the claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and plural unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by the context.
All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g. “such as”) provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed.
Any asymmetric atom (e.g., carbon or the like) of the compound(s) of the present invention can be present in racemic or enantiomerically enriched, for example the (R)-, (S)- or (R,S)-configuration. In certain embodiments, each asymmetric atom has at least 50% enantiomeric excess, at least 60% enantiomeric excess, at least 70% enantiomeric excess, at least 80% enantiomeric excess, at least 90% enantiomeric excess, at least 95% enantiomeric excess, or at least 99% enantiomeric excess in the (R)- or (S)-configuration. Substituents at atoms with unsaturated double bonds may, if possible, be present in cis-(Z)- or trans-(E)-form.
Accordingly, as used herein a compound of the present invention can be in the form of one of the possible stereoisomers, rotamers, atropisomers, tautomers or mixtures thereof, for example, as substantially pure geometric (cis or trans) stereoisomers, diastereomers, optical isomers (antipodes), racemates or mixtures thereof.
Any resulting mixtures of stereoisomers can be separated on the basis of the physicochemical differences of the constituents, into the pure or substantially pure geometric or optical isomers, diastereomers, racemates, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization.
Any resulting racemates of final products or intermediates can be resolved into the optical antipodes by known methods, e.g., by separation of the diastereomeric salts thereof, obtained with an optically active acid or base, and liberating the optically active acidic or basic compound. In particular, a basic moiety may thus be employed to resolve the compounds of the present invention into their optical antipodes, e.g., by fractional crystallization of a salt formed with an optically active acid, e.g., tartaric acid, dibenzoyl tartaric acid, diacetyl tartaric acid, di-O,O'-p-toluoyl tartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid. Racemic products can also be resolved by chiral chromatography, e.g., high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral adsorbent.
The present invention also provides pro-drugs of the compounds of the present invention that converts in vivo to the compounds of the present invention. A pro-drug is an active or inactive compound that is modified chemically through in vivo physiological action, such as hydrolysis, metabolism and the like, into a compound of this invention following administration of the prodrug to a subject. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using pro-drugs are well known by those skilled in the art. Prodrugs can be conceptually divided into two non-exclusive categories, bioprecursor prodrugs and carrier prodrugs. See The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Ch. 31-32 (Ed. Wermuth, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif., 2001). Generally, bioprecursor prodrugs are compounds, which are inactive or have low activity compared to the corresponding active drug compound, that contain one or more protective groups and are converted to an active form by metabolism or solvolysis. Both the active drug form and any released metabolic products should have acceptably low toxicity.
Carrier prodrugs are drug compounds that contain a transport moiety, e.g., that improve uptake and/or localized delivery to a site(s) of action. Desirably for such a carrier prodrug, the linkage between the drug moiety and the transport moiety is a covalent bond, the prodrug is inactive or less active than the drug compound, and any released transport moiety is acceptably non-toxic. For prodrugs where the transport moiety is intended to enhance uptake, typically the release of the transport moiety should be rapid. In other cases, it is desirable to utilize a moiety that provides slow release, e.g., certain polymers or other moieties, such as cyclodextrins. Carrier prodrugs can, for example, be used to improve one or more of the following properties: increased lipophilicity, increased duration of pharmacological effects, increased site-specificity, decreased toxicity and adverse reactions, and/or improvement in drug formulation (e.g., stability, water solubility, suppression of an undesirable organoleptic or physiochemical property). For example, lipophilicity can be increased by esterification of (a) hydroxyl groups with lipophilic carboxylic acids (e.g., a carboxylic acid having at least one lipophilic moiety), or (b) carboxylic acid groups with lipophilic alcohols (e.g., an alcohol having at least one lipophilic moiety, for example aliphatic alcohols). For example, solubility can be increased by esterification of a hydroxy group with phosphoric acid.
Exemplary prodrugs are, e.g., O-acyl or O-phosphate derivatives of alcohols or phenols, wherein acyl has a meaning as defined herein. Suitable acids for formation of the O-acyl prodrugs are e.g. substituted or unsubstituted alkyl-, cycloalkyl- or benzyl-carboxylic acids. Amines have been masked as arylcarbonyloxymethyl substituted derivatives which are cleaved by esterases in vivo releasing the free drug and formaldehyde (Bundgaard, J. Med. Chem. 2503 (1989)). Moreover, drugs containing an acidic NH group, such as imidazole, imide, indole and the like, have been masked with N-acyloxymethyl groups (Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985)). Hydroxy groups have been masked as esters and ethers, vicinal diols have been masked as cyclic acetals or ketals. Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention, including their salts, can also be obtained in the form of their hydrates, or include other solvents used for their crystallization. The compounds of the present invention may inherently or by design form solvates with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents (including water); therefore, it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated and unsolvated forms. The term “solvate” refers to a molecular complex of a compound of the present invention (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) with one or more solvent molecules. Such solvent molecules are those commonly used in the pharmaceutical art, which are known to be innocuous to the recipient, e.g., water, ethanol, and the like. The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water.
In one embodiment, the compound of Formula (I), (II) or (III) is in a hydrate form.
Typically, the compounds of formula (I), (II) or (III) can be prepared according to the Schemes B, C D provided infra. The required intermediates J are prepared as described below in Scheme A.
<img> id-US20180111932A1-20180426-C00012.TIF </img>
In scheme A the aromatic starting material A is deprotonated by a strong base (e.g. LDA or n-BuLi) and reacted with e.g. alkyl formate or DMF to yield the aromatic aldehyde. The aldehyde B can be reacted with a deprotonated alkyne (e.g a Grignard reagent or a lithiated species) to furnish the benzyl alcohols C which are oxidized to the ketone under appropriate oxidizing conditions such as the Dess-Martin periodinane reagent. Alternatively, ketones D can be prepared from the aromatic acids E which are coupled with an amine to form amides F which are substrate for the reaction with appropriate Grignard reagents. Reaction of an aniline under Lewis-catalysis (e.g. AlCl3, BF3*Et2O, Sc(OTf)3) provides intermediates H which can be cyclized to the annelated 4-pyridones under basic conditions (e.g. potassium carbonate).
X2, X3 are as defined in the Summary of the Invention and R1*, R4*, R5* and R6* include the definitions for R1, R4, R5 and R6 as defined in the Summary of the Invention but can be also substituents which can be transformed into R1, R4, R5 and R6.
Scheme B describes the synthesis of compound of Formula I, in particular compounds of Formula (I) wherein R1 is CH2OH, CHF2, CHO, CN, CH3, R3 is -ORa or -NHRb and/or R2 is C1-4alkoxy, haloC1-4alkoxy and -NH-C1-4alkyl.

Examples of the general formula Ia and Ib can be prepared as described in Scheme B.
Intermediates J can be converted directly to compounds Ia by nucleophilic aromatic substitution with amines and alcohols and-if necessary-subsequent protecting group manipulations. For intermediates K the substituent R4 can be introduced e.g by reaction with zinc reagents or Suzuki coupling with boronic acids. For intermediates L the methyl group can be oxidized with selenium dioxide to the aldehyde which can be converted to a primary alcohol be e.g. NaBH4 reduction. The aldehyde functionality can also be transformed into a difluoromethyl group by fluorination with a suitable fluorination agent. Further, the aldehyde group can be transformed into a nitrile by a sequence of reactions involving oxidation to the acid, formation of the amide and dehydration. For intermediates N with X2═CCl a second nucleophilic aromatic substitution with alcohols, amines, Grignard or zinc reagents can lead to compounds of the general formula Ib.
Scheme C describes the introduction of various R3 groups different from the ones described in Scheme B.
<img> id-US20180111932A1-20180426-C00014.TIF </img>
According to Scheme C, intermediates J can be coupled via Pd-catalyzed Suzuki coupling with boronic acids to examples of the general formula Ic where R is connected to the ring system via a C-C bond. Alternatively, intermediates J can also react with Grignard reagents to compounds P which can be transformed to examples of the formula Id and Ie by the conditions indicated in the scheme. Reaction of intermediates J with stannanes provides e.g. intermediates O and Q which can be transformed via a set of conditions to further examples of the general formula If and Ig.
Scheme D describes the synthesis of compound of Formula I wherein R5 is C2-6alkynyl.
<img> id-US20180111932A1-20180426-C00015.TIF </img>
Intermediates J can be transformed to compounds R by nucleophilic aromatic substitution. Reaction with terminal alkynes via Pd/Cu-catalysis (Sonogashira coupling) and-if necessary-subsequent protecting group manipulations yields examples of the general formula Ih.
The invention further includes any variant of the present processes, in which an intermediate product obtainable at any stage thereof is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out, or in which the starting materials are formed in situ under the reaction conditions, or in which the reaction components are used in the form of their salts or optically pure material.
Compounds of the invention and intermediates can also be converted into each other according to methods generally known to those skilled in the art.
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In a further embodiment, the composition comprises at least two pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as those described herein. For purposes of the present invention, unless designated otherwise, solvates and hydrates are generally considered compositions. Preferably, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sterile. The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for particular routes of administration such as oral administration, parenteral administration, and rectal administration, etc. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be made up in a solid form (including without limitation capsules, tablets, pills, granules, powders or suppositories), or in a liquid form (including without limitation solutions, suspensions or emulsions). The pharmaceutical compositions can be subjected to conventional pharmaceutical operations such as sterilization and/or can contain conventional inert diluents, lubricating agents, or buffering agents, as well as adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers and buffers, etc.
Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions are tablets or gelatin capsules comprising the active ingredient together with one or more of:
a) diluents, e.g., lactose, dextrose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, cellulose and/or glycine;b) lubricants, e.g., silica, talcum, stearic acid, its magnesium or calcium salt and/or polyethyleneglycol; for tablets alsoc) binders, e.g., magnesium aluminum silicate, starch paste, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone; if desiredd) disintegrants, e.g., starches, agar, alginic acid or its sodium salt, or effervescent mixtures; ande) absorbents, colorants, flavors and sweeteners.
Tablets may be either film coated or enteric coated according to methods known in the art.
Suitable compositions for oral administration include an effective amount of a compound of the invention in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use are prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions can contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets may contain the active ingredient in admixture with nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients are, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets are uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.
Certain injectable compositions are aqueous isotonic solutions or suspensions, and suppositories are advantageously prepared from fatty emulsions or suspensions. Said compositions may be sterilized and/or contain adjuvants, such as preserving, stabilizing, wetting or emulsifying agents, solution promoters, salts for regulating the osmotic pressure and/or buffers. In addition, they may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances. Said compositions are prepared according to conventional mixing, granulating or coating methods, respectively, and contain about 0.1-75%, or contain about 1-50%, of the active ingredient.
The present invention further provides anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising the compounds of the present invention as active ingredients, since water may facilitate the degradation of certain compounds.
Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions are packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastics, unit dose containers (e. g., vials), blister packs, and strip packs.
The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms that comprise one or more agents that reduce the rate by which the compound of the present invention as an active ingredient will decompose. Such agents, which are referred to herein as “stabilizers,” include, but are not limited to, antioxidants such as ascorbic acid, pH buffers, or salt buffers, etc.
Method of the Invention
The compounds of any one of formulae I to III in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. GIRK1/4 channel modulating properties, e.g. as indicated in vitro and in vivo tests as provided in the next sections, and are therefore indicated for therapy or for use as research chemicals, e.g. as tool compounds.
As previously described, GIRK1/4 has been identified as a desirable anti-arrhythmia target for atrial fibrillation.
Additionally, GIRK1/4 blockers has been described as potentially useful in Sinoatrial/atrioventricular node dysfunction: GIRK1/4 channels mediate repolarization of the spontaneously depolarizing cells of the sinoatrial (SAN) and atrioventricular (AVN) nodes. Acetylcholine released from vagal nerve efferents binds to M2 muscarinic receptors present in these tissues, which in turn act upon GIRK1/4 channels to open them and permit potassium ion efflux from the cell. This repolarization (or hyperpolarization depending on the magnitude of efflux) determines the timing between spontaneous depolarizations, and hence heart rate and AV nodal conduction rate. Blockade of GIRK1/4 channels is expected to oppose the negative chronotropic effects of acetylcholine, and this has been observed with the selective peptide GIRK1/4 blocker tertiapin (Drici et al., 2000. The bee venom peptide tertiapin underlines the role of I(KACh) in acetylcholine-induced atrioventricular blocks. British journal of pharmacology 131, 569-577). In human diseases of pacemaking (e.g. sick sinus syndrome) the sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodes are dysfunctional, which can induce a variety of arrhythmias including bradycardia and asystoles. GIRK1/4 blockade may be expected to ameliorate such arrhythmias. For example, in a recent study, genetic deletion of GIRK4 was shown to rescue the failure of cardiac impulse generation and conduction induced by heart-specific silencing of the so-called “funny current”, which mediates spontaneous depolarization in sinoatrial and atrioventricular tissue (Mesirca et al., 2014. Cardiac arrhythmia induced by genetic silencing of ‘funny’ (f) channels is rescued by GIRK4 inactivation. Nature communications 5, 4664).
Furthermore, GIRK1/4 blockers has been described as potentially useful in primary hyperaldosteronism: Somatic and germline gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ5 (encoding GIRK4) have recently been implicated in primary aldosteronism, a condition that induces hypertension. These mutations alter the selectivity filter of the GIRK4 channel and permit sodium ion influx into certain adrenal cells. The resulting cellular depolarization permits calcium influx, which in turn enhances aldosterone production and secretion, and may also induce cellular proliferation to produce an aldosterone-secreting adenoma (Scholl and Lifton, 2013. New insights into aldosterone-producing adenomas and hereditary aldosteronism: mutations in the K+ channel KCNJ5. Current opinion in nephrology and hypertension 22, 141-147). It is therefore possible that a selective GIRK4 blocker may prevent sodium ion influx, and its attendant promotion of aldosterone secretion in these patients.

The term “diuretic” includes thiazide derivatives (e.g., chlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide, methylclothiazide, and chlorothalidon).
DPP-IV is responsible for inactivating GLP-1. More particularly, DPP-IV generates a GLP-1 receptor antagonist and thereby shortens the physiological response to GLP-1. GLP-1 is a major stimulator of pancreatic insulin secretion and has direct beneficial effects on glucose disposal. The DPP-IV inhibitor can be peptidic or, preferably, non-peptidic. DPP-IV inhibitors are in each case generically and specifically disclosed e.g. in WO 98/19998, DE 196 16 486 A1, WO 00/34241 and WO 95/15309, in each case in particular in the compound claims and the final products of the working examples, the subject-matter of the final products, the pharmaceutical preparations and the claims are hereby incorporated into the present application by reference to these publications. Preferred are those compounds that are specifically disclosed in Example 3 of WO 98/19998 and Example 1 of WO 00/34241, respectively.
GLP-1 is an insulinotropic protein which is described, e.g., by W. E. Schmidt et al. in Diabetologia, 28, 1985, 704-707 and in U.S. Pat. No. 5,705,483. The term “GLP-1 agonists” includes variants and analogs of GLP-1(7-36)NH2 which are disclosed in particular in U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,712, U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,666, U.S. Pat. No. 5,512,549, WO 91/11457 and by C. Orskov et al in J. Biol. Chem. 264 (1989) 12826. Further examples include GLP-1(7-37), in which compound the carboxy-terminal amide functionality of Arg36 is displaced with Gly at the 37th position of the GLP-1(7-36)NH2 molecule and variants and analogs thereof including GLN9-GLP-1(7-37), D-GLN9-GLP-1(7-37), acetyl LYS9-GLP-1(7-37), LYS18-GLP-1(7-37) and, in particular, GLP-1(7-37)OH, VAL8-GLP-1(7-37), GLY8-GLP-1(7-37), THR8-GLP-1(7-37), MET8-GLP-1(7-37) and 4-imidazopropionyl-GLP-1. Special preference is also given to the GLP agonist analog exendin-4, described by Greig et al. in Diabetologia 1999, 42, 45-50.
An aldosterone synthase inhibitor or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is understood to be an active ingredient that has the property to inhibit the production of aldosterone. Aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) is a mitochondrial cytochrome P450 enzyme catalyzing the last step of aldosterone production in the adrenal cortex, i.e., the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone. The inhibition of the aldosterone production with so-called aldosterone synthase inhibitors is known to be a successful variant to treatment of hypokalemia, hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation or renal failure. Such aldosterone synthase inhibition activity is readily determined by those skilled in the art according to standard assays (e.g., US 2007/0049616).
The class of aldosterone synthase inhibitors comprises both steroidal and non-steroidal aldosterone synthase inhibitors, the later being most preferred.
Preference is given to commercially available aldosterone synthase inhibitors or those aldosterone synthase inhibitors that have been approved by the health authorities. The class of aldosterone synthase inhibitors comprises compounds having differing structural features. For example, mention may be made of the compounds which are selected from the group consisting of the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole, fadrozole (including the (+)-enantiomer thereof), as well as the steroidal aromatase inhibitor exemestane, or, in each case where applicable, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
The most preferred non-steroidal aldosterone synthase inhibitor is the (+)-enantiomer of the hydrochloride of fadrozole (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,617,307 and 4,889,861) of formula
<img> id-US20180111932A1-20180426-C00016.TIF </img>
or, if appropriable, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
A preferred steroidal aldosterone antagonist is eplerenone (cf. EP 122232 A) of the formula
<img> id-US20180111932A1-20180426-C00017.TIF </img>
or Spironolactone; or, in each case, if appropriable, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Synthesis of Examples
Synthesis of Examples 1 to 57
The following examples of formula Ia, Ib have been prepared from intermediates 1 to 13 by nucleophilic aromatic substitution with alcohols and amines. If necessary, deprotection of protective groups on additional alcohol functionality in the molecules was done as the ultimate step.
General Method:
In a reaction vial, intermediates 1 to 13 (typically 0.1-0.25 mmol, 1 eq.), alcohol (5-10 eq.) or amine (1.2 eq.), K2CO3 (5-10 eq.) and DMAP (0.1-0.5 eq.) were mixed in MeCN (1-3 mL). Other solvents which are used in case of poor solubility are THF or NMP or DMF. The resulting reaction mixture was heated for 1-16h at 80° C. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc and washed with water. The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography or in the case of very polar products by reverse phase HPLC (0.1% ammonia in MeCN/water) to afford the desired products Ia, Ib (40-80% yield) as a white or off white solid. In cases where the alcohol or amine has several reactive nucleophilic centers reagents were used where the additional functional group(s) was protected with a TBDMS, Boc group or as a ketal. In this case the protective group was removed by treatment with TFA in DCM at room temperature, TBAF in THF at 0° C. or AcOH/water (˜2/1) at room temperature. After aqueous work-up as described above the crude product was purified by silica gel chromatography or in the case of very polar products by reverse phase HPLC (0.1% ammonia in MeCN/water) to afford the desired products Ia, Ib as a white or off white solid.

The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature in 30 min and stirred for 2h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by HPLC. If starting material was <0.5%, workup was initiated, otherwise the reaction was stirred for another 4˜16 h monitored by HPLC. Into the reaction mixture was added THF/H2O=20 mL/2 mL with internal temperature of 20˜25° C., then 20% of NH4Cl solution (100 mL) was added with internal temperature of 20˜25° C. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2×100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (100 mL) followed by 20% of brine (100 mL).
Crystallization: The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure to get a residue of around 40 g, then n-heptane (2×400 ml) was used to run the azeotrope distillation until 50 g of residue was obtained. n-Heptane (400 mL) was added into the residue and the mixture was heated to internal temperature of 60° C. in 30 min, hold for 1˜2 h and then the hot mixture was filtered.

Example 1A (Hydrate Form B)
Recrystallization
To 200 mg of amorphous material of example 1, 1 ml acetonitrile/water (9:1, v/v) was added to get a clear solution at 50° C. with stirring. After 1h of stirring at this temperature, the solution was cooled down slowly to 5° C. and a white precipitate occurred. The precipitate was separated by centrifugation and dried at 40° C. for 12 hrs. A white crystalline powder (modification hydrate form B) of the compound was obtained.

b) Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) trace of Form B was obtained using TA Instruments Q2000 (DSC) and Q5000 (TGA) using the heating range indicated in the FIGS. 2 to 3.
DSC Method Description
Accurately weigh 0.5-1.5 mg of test substance each into a sample pan with pinhole and a closed (hermetic) sample pan. Empty sample pans are used as reference. The DSC thermogram is recorded as follow: the temperature of the apparatus is adjusted to about −40° C., and heated to 300° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min, under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min. The instrument is calibrated for temperature and enthalpy with Indium, at least 99.9999% pure to 300° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min, under a nitrogen flow of 50 mL/min.. The accuracy of the measured sample temperature with this method is within about ±1° C., and the heat of fusion can be measured within a relative error of about ±5%.
With pinhole sample pan (FIG. 2.) I Glass temperature onset: Tonset=38.77 C°, melting endotherm onset: Tonset=113.69° C.
With hermetic sample pan (FIG. 3.); Melting endotherm onset: Tonset=82.30° C.
TGA Method Description
Accurately weigh 10-20 mg of test substance into the Al-sample pan. The TGA thermogram is recorded as follows: To avoid weight losses the sample pan has a hermetically sealed lid that is pierced automatically only moments before the sample is loaded into the furnace. The temperature equilibrated to 30° C. and heated to 200° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min, under a flow of nitrogen at 25 mL/min.
The instrument is calibrated for temperature with nickel and aluminum, and calibrated for weight with a 5 and 10 mg standard. (FIG. 4)
