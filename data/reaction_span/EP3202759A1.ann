T1	REACTION_SPAN 19582 19594;19595 20289	(1) Step (A) 4-Bromobenzaldehyde and boronic acid were subjected to Suzuki cross coupling reaction using a palladium catalyst as shown in [Scheme 1a]. Specifically, 4-bromobenzaldehyde (3 g, 16.21 mmol), boronic acid (1.28 equivalents), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (4-8 mol%) and sodium carbonate (4.86 equivalents) were refluxed in degassed toluene/distilled water (150 mL/21.6 mL) for 18 hours while heating. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and the filtrate was washed twice with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and water (200 mL). The organic layer was combined and dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo and then separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography.
T2	REACTION_SPAN 20290 20311;20312 20616;20617 21597	(2) Steps (B) and (C) An imine compound was obtained by subjecting the compound of the step (A) to reductive amination using L-alaninamide hydrochloride or D-alaninamide hydrochloride (step (B), Scheme 1b). Then, an amine compound was obtained by reducing the imine compound with sodium cyanoborohydride (step (C), Scheme 1c). After adding 1.2 equivalents of glycinamide hydrochloride or L-alaninamide hydrochloride or D-alaninamide hydrochloride or L-valinamide hydrochloride or L-leucinamide hydrochloride to anhydrous methanol to a concentration of 0.92 M, 1.5 equivalents of triethylamine was added. When the solution became transparent, 1.0 equivalent of the aldehyde synthesized in the step (A) was added. Two hours later, the solution was washed with ethyl acetate and distilled water. After drying the organic layer with sodium sulfate and drying in vacuo, the concentrated reaction solution was dissolved in anhydrous methanol to a concentration of 1.0 M and then 4.0 equivalents of sodium cyanoborohydride was added at 0 °C. After performing reaction at room temperature for 18 hours, the reaction solution was washed with ethyl acetate and distilled water. The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo and then separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography.

A compound in salt form is synthesized to improve the solubility of the amine compound synthesized in the preceding step. The compound in salt form may be synthesized using an acid. The acid that can be used is described above but is not limited thereto. Specifically, a compound in salt form was synthesized using methanesulfonic acid. After heating ethyl acetate to 50-55 °C and completely dissolving 1.0 equivalent of the compound of the step (C), 1.25 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid was added. 1 hour later, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered using a vacuum filtration device. The filtrate was washed with ethyl acetate and dried without a purification process.
