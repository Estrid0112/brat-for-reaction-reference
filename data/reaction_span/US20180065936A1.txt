BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The human retinoid X receptors (hRXRs) consist of three identified isoforms (α, β, γ) that function as transcription promoters often in partnership with other members of a larger nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription regulators including the thyroid receptor (TR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), the liver X receptor (LXR), the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR). While 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been shown to bind to hRXRs and promote RXR element (RXRE) regulated transcription (i.e. function as RXR agonists), it is still unclear if RXR has a bona fide endogenous molecular ligand. RXR has been described as the central NR regulator, because it often plays a critical role, either as a permissive or non-permissive partner, in heterodimer complexes that must be formed with the other NRs to regulate their respective response elements.
Recent studies have identified several RXR-selective-binding molecular ligands (rexinoids) that can modulate not only RXRE regulated transcription but also the heterodimer regulated transcription of other NRs. For instance, RXR is a subordinate partner in the RXR-RAR heterodimer, otherwise referred to as a non-permissive heterodimer, since transcription is not promoted in the RAR unliganded (apo-RAR) heterodimer with RXR. Additionally, the RXR-TR heterodimer is non-permissive. In contrast to these non-permissive heterodimers, permissive heterodimers such as RXR-PPAR allow transcription to be promoted in the presence of either RXR or PPAR agonists. The RXR-LXR heterodimer is also permissive. Hence, there is enormous potential for RXR agonists to activate or repress various biological pathways and effect therapeutic results for various conditions that would benefit from activation or repression of a specific pathway.
Bexarotene has been used to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma. Bexarotene has also been shown to be useful for treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, bexarotene treatment results in untoward side effects, possibly due to its nonspecific nature of binding RXR in several states, including the RXR-RXR homodimer form as well as RXR heterodimer forms.
McFarland, K., et al, ACS Chem. Neurosci., 2013, 4(11), 1430-1438 treated a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD) with bexarotene and noted marked improvement in the PD symptoms. Specifically the bexarotene restored dopamine cells and natural behavior in the PD model. As importantly, the bexarotene dose that accomplished this was quite low, alleviating some side effects. The researchers demonstrated that these symptoms were alleviated by bexarotene binding to RXR and its heterodimerizing with another nuclear recpetor called Nurr1.
PD is a chronic, debilitating disorder in which the neurons of the central nervous system degenerate over time. Specifically the dopamine secreting cells of the midbrain slowy die off, leaving the patient with a wide range of symptoms due to the lack of dopamine. Early symptoms include shaking, off balance gait, and slowless of muscles. Over time, symptoms worsen and additional symptoms including demetia and/or depression can develop. Treatments include dopamine agonists, given to try to ameliorate the effect of loss of dopamine in the system.

Diseases and Condition
Compounds of the invention possessing RXR agonist properties are useful for treating Alzheimer's disease. The compounds of the invention may also treat Alzheimer's disease by targeting a combination of RXR:LXR controlled genes (like ApoE), or by binding to amyloid beta oligomers (where cholesterol usually binds) and disrupting calcium channel formation in neurons (Fantini, J. et al. ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014, DOI: 10.1021/cn400183w).
Compounds of the invention are also useful for treating cancers, including but not limited to, colon, breast, lung, pancreatic, skin, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, ovarian, bladder, kidney, head and neck cancers, and Kaposi's sarcoma. See breast cancer: Esteva, F. J. et al. JCO, 2003, 21, 999-1006; advanced non-small lung cancer: (a) Khuri, F. R. et al. JCO, 2001, 19, 2626-2637 and (b) Lamph, W. W. et al. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004, 10, 8656-8664; pancreatic cancer: Liby, K. Cancer Prev. Res. 2010, 3, 1427-1434; and colon cancer: Cesario, R. M. et al. Cancer Letters 2006, 240, 225-233.
Compounds of the invention possessing RXR agonist properties and/or that target the Nurr1 receptor are useful for treating Parkinson's disease (see McFarland, K., et al, ACS Chem. Neurosci., 2013, 4(11), 1430-1438), while compounds of the invention possessing RXR agonist properties and/or PPARg activity may be useful for treating diabetes (see Mukherjee, R. et al. Nature, 1997, 386, 407-410).
The compounds of the invention may also be useful for treating, psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Such treatment may also be carried out in combination with other antipsychotic treatments (see Lerner, V. et al. Clin. Neuropharmacol. 2008, 31, 25-33).
In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic, a salt of a compound of the invention can be useful as an intermediate for isolating or purifying a compound of the invention. Additionally, administration of a compound of the invention as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base salt may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.
The compounds can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.
Thus, the compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.
Useful dosages of the compounds of the invention can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949. Compounds that are non-toxic and non-mutagenic at typical dose levels will have useful doses. (Mortelmans, K.; Zeiger, E. “The Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay.” Mutat. Res. 2000, 455, 29-60).
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.
Compounds can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents. In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention can be administered in combination with agents that are useful for the treatment of diseases associated with dopamine deficiency. For example, the compounds can be administered (and/or formulated) with clozapine, olanzapine, haloperidol, risperidone, perphenazine, quetiapine, or chlorpromazine.
The ability of a compound of the invention to act as an RXR agonist (e.g. to promote or activate RXR, i.e., promote or activate RXR regulated gene expression) may be determined using pharmacological models which are well known to the art, or using Test A or Test B described below.
Test A. RXR Selective Agonist Assay (Mammalian Two-Hybrid Assay).
Compounds are tested for RXR selective agonist activity via a mammalian two-hybrid assay in human colon cancer cells, HCT-116. The cell line is transfected with pCMVhRXR binding domain vector (BD), hRXR activation domain (AD), pFR-Luc reporter gene containing BD-binding sites, and a renilla control plasmid. Cells are transfected for 18 hours utilizing a liposome-mediated transfection protocol then exposed to either the ethanol vehicle or 10−7 M Bexarotene or the indicted analog. After 24 hours the cells are lysed and a luciferase assay was completed. Analog dependent RXR binding and homodimerization, as measured by luciferase output, is compared to the parent compound Bexarotene.
Test B. RXR Agonist Assay (RXRE-Luciferase Based Assay).
An RXRE-luciferase assay is run at 25 nM in HCT-116 cells. The RXRE assays are completed using HCT-116 cells plated at 100,000 cells/well in 24 well plates. The cells are co-transfected using 250 ng of a RXRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (RXRE from the naturally occurring responsive element in the rat cellular retinol binding protein II gene), 50 ng of pSG5-human RXRα vector, 20 ng of the renilla control plasmid and 2 μL/well of Polyjet transfection reagent for liposome-mediated delivery of the DNA. The cells are treated with ethanol or analogs (final concentration of 25 nM) for 24-hours post-transfection. After a 24-hour incubation period, the amount of rexinoid activity is measured using luciferase output via a dual-luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, Wis.) in a Sirus luminometer (Berthold Detection System, Pforzheim, Germany). Two independent assays are conducted with four samples for each treatment group.
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.
