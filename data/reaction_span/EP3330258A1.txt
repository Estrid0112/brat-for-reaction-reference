CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
This application claims the benefit of Chinese Invention Patent Application No. 201510459126.X filed at the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China on July 30, 2015, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present application relates to the pharmaceutical field, and more specifically to a 1,3,5-triazine derivative and a method of using the same.
BACKGROUND
As the most important key enzyme in intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle, IDH (full name: isocitrate dehydrogenase) can catalyze oxidative decarboxylation of isocitric acid to 2-oxoglutarate (i.e., α-ketoglutaric acid). Researches have shown that many tumors (such as, glioma, sarcoma, and acute myelocytic leukemia) have an IDH mutation at arginine residue in a catalytic center (IDH1/R132H, IDH2/R140Q, and IDH2/R172K). The mutated IDH acquires a new ability to catalyze the conversion of α-ketoglutaric acid (α-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG). Researches have shown that the structure of α-ketoglutaric acid is similar to that of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, and 2-HG competes with α-KG, thereby reducing the activity of α-KG-dependent enzymes, and resulting in a high methylation of chromatin. Such supermethylation is considered to interfere with a normal cell differentiation, and lead to an excessive proliferation of immature cells, thereby resulting in cancers.
In 2013, Agios Pharmaceuticals reported an IDH2/R140Q inhibitor AGI-6780 (Science. 2013, 340, 622-626) and an IDH1/R132H inhibitor AGI-5198 (Science. 2013, 340, 626-630), and WO2015017821 disclosed another IDH2/R140Q inhibitor AG-221. AGI-6780 and AGI-5198 can inhibit the generation of 2-HG in cells carrying the most common IDH2 mutant and the most common IDH1 mutant, respectively. These molecules not only inhibit the generation of 2-HG, but also induce the differentiation of abnormally proliferated human cancer cells in a culture. The treatment of leukemia cells carrying the IDH2 mutant with AGI-6780, and the treatment of glioma cells carrying the IDH1 mutant with AGI-5198 both result in an enhanced expression of mature markers in these cells. Moreover, researchers have found that AGI-5198 can inhibit the growth rate of the glioma cells either by the treatment of cell cultures with AGI-5198 or by oral administration of AGI-5198 to mice with a transplanted tumor.

Accordingly, the appearances of the phase "in one embodiment", or "in an embodiment", or "in another embodiment", or "in some embodiments" in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment. In addition, the particular elements, structures, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.
It should be noted that, as used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to a reaction in which "a catalyst" is involved includes a single catalyst, or two or more catalysts. Unless otherwise explicitly specified herein, it should also be noted that the term "or" is generally employed in its sense including "and/or" unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.

Experimental Example 1: Determining IDH2 Inhibitory Activity
The inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present application against IDH2 (R172K, 40-end) was determined by using the following method, which was expressed as IC50 values, i.e., the concentrations of the compounds required to achieve 50% inhibition of IDH2 activity.
Materials and Methods:
The inhibitory activity of a compound against IDH2 (R172K, 40-end) was determined by the decrease of a helper factor NADPH. The test compound was pre-incubated with an enzyme and NADPH, and then a reaction was initiated by the addition of a-KG, and performed for 120 minutes under a linear condition. Then, the reaction was terminated by the addition of diaphorase (lipoamide dehydrogenase) and the corresponding substrate resazurin. Diaphorase terminated the IDH2m reaction by decreasing the available helper factor NADPH, which oxidized NADPH to NADP, and reduced resazurin to highly fluorescent resorufin. The amount of remaining helper factor NADPH after a specific reaction time was quantified via an easily detectable fluorophore.
Specifically, 2.5 µl of a 3-fold gradient diluted test compound was added to a 384-well plate, and then 5 µl of a reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, PH7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10 mM MgCl2; 10 mM MnCl2; 0.4 mg/ml BSA and 2 mM DTT) containing 80 nM IDH2 (R172K, 40-end) and 40 µM NADPH was added. Then, the resulting test mixture was incubated for 120 minutes at a temperature of 23 °C, and then 2.5 µl of the reaction buffer containing 4 mM a-KG was added to initiate the reaction. After incubating for 120 minutes at room temperature, 5 µl of a termination mixture (0.4 U/ml diaphorase and 40 µM resazurin) prepared with the reaction buffer was added to convert resazurin to resorufin to determine the remaining NADPH. After incubating for 10 minutes at a temperature of 23 °C, a fluorescence value was determined through Flexstation 3 at Ex535/Em595.
The inhibitory activity of test compound against IDH2 was shown in Table 1.

Experimental Example 2: Measuring Pharmacokinetics Parameters
The pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds of the present application were determined by using the following method.
Healthy male adult rats (7-9 weeks old) were used in this study. Each group of animals (3 male rats) was intragastrically administered once at a single dose of 5 mg/kg. The animals in the intragastric administration group were fasted overnight before this study. The fasting time period was from 10 hours before administration to 4 hours after administration.
Blood samples were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after administration. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane using an animal anesthesia machine, and then 0.3 mL whole blood samples were taken from the fundus venous plexus. The blood samples were placed in heparin anticoagulant tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C and 4000 rpm. The resulting plasmas were transferred to centrifuge tubes, and stored at -80° C until analysis.
Verified LC-MS/MS method was used to analyze the plasma samples. Plasma concentration-time data of animals were analyzed using WinNonlin (Professional Edition, version 6.3; Pharsight Company) software. The non-compartmental model was introduced for concentration analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds were calculated. As shown in Table 2, the compound in Example 3 had a better metabolism in vivo and a longer half-life, and had a higher plasma concentration than an IDH2 inhibitor AG-221 at the same dose.
