BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium commonly found on the skin and in moist areas, such as the nasal cavity, yet it is often broadly resistant to many antibiotics. β-Lactam antibiotics were the drugs of choice for treatment of infection by S. aureus, but a variant of this organism, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged in 1961, which exhibited resistance to the entire class of β-lactams. This organism has been a global clinical problem for over half a century. The molecular basis for the broad resistance of MRSA to β-lactams, which is incidentally inducible, was traced to a set of genes within the bla and mec operons. The BlaR1 (or the cognate MecR1) protein is a β-lactam antibiotic sensor/signal transducer, which communicates the presence of the antibiotic in the milieu to the cytoplasm in a process that is largely not understood (FIG. 1) (Staude et al., Biochemistry 2015, 54, 1600-1610). Signal transduction leads to activation of the cytoplasmic domain of BlaR1 (or MecR1), a zinc protease, which turns over the gene repressor BlaI (or MecI) in derepressing transcriptional events that result in expression of antibiotic-resistance determinants, the class A β-lactamase PC1 and/or the penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a) (Llarrull and Mobashery, Biochemistry 2012, 51, 4642-4649).
An intriguing aspect of this system is its inducibility. Upon exposure to the antibiotic, the organism mobilizes. Once the antibiotic challenge is withdrawn, the system reverses itself. It was argued that when the signal for the presence of the antibiotic transduces to the cytoplasmic domain, the BlaR1 protein undergoes autoproteolysis, which unleashes the activity of the protease domain in degradation of the gene repressor BlaI. We have found that this autoproteolytic processing takes place in the absence of antibiotic as well. Therefore, proteolysis may lead to turnover of BlaR1 itself as an event in the reversal of induction. What is needed is the identification of what accounts for activation of the cytoplasmic domain toward degradation of BlaI in manifestation of the antibiotic-resistance response. Such identification could provide needed methods for reducing, preventing, or otherwise abrogating resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.
SUMMARY
We disclose herein that the BlaR1 protein of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), an antibiotic sensor/signal transducer, is phosphorylated on exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. This event is critical for the onset of the biochemical events that unleash induction of antibiotic resistance. The BlaR1 phosphorylation and the antibiotic-resistance phenotype are abrogated in the presence of novel inhibitors that restore susceptibility of the organism to β-lactam antibiotics. The invention provides compounds, compositions, and methods for reducing, preventing, overcoming, and/or abrogating resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, and methods of treating bacterial infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria, particularly bacteria that can develop resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.
Accordingly, the invention provides compositions and methods for increasing the sensitivity of bacterial pathogens to antibiotics, including β-lactam antibiotics.

Alkyl groups can be optionally substituted or unsubstituted, and optionally partially unsaturated, such as in an alkenyl group.
The term “halogen” refers to chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine. The term “halo” refers to chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo.
As to any of the groups or “substituents” described herein (e.g., groups R1 and R2), each can further include one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) substituents. It is understood, of course, that such groups do not contain any substitution or substitution patterns which are sterically impractical and/or synthetically non-feasible.
The term “substituted” means that a specified group or moiety can bear one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) substituents. The term “unsubstituted” means that the specified group bears no substituents. The term “optionally substituted” means that the specified group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the term “substituted” is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system. In cases where a specified moiety or group is not expressly noted as being optionally substituted or substituted with any specified substituent, it is understood that such a moiety or group is intended to be unsubstituted in some embodiments but can be substituted in other embodiments. In other words, the variables R1, R2, and R3 and their elements can be optionally substituted.

An “effective amount” refers to an amount effective to treat a disease, disorder, and/or condition, or to bring about a recited effect. For example, an effective amount can be an amount effective to reduce the progression or severity of the condition or symptoms being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capacity of persons skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. The term “effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound described herein, or an amount of a combination of compounds described herein, e.g., that is effective to treat or prevent a disease or disorder, or to treat the symptoms of the disease or disorder, in a host. Thus, an “effective amount” generally means an amount that provides the desired effect.
For example, the term “effective amount” can refer to an amount of compound or composition, which upon administration, is capable of reducing or preventing proliferation of a bacteria, reducing or preventing symptoms associated with a bacterial infection, reducing the likelihood of bacterial infection, or preventing bacterial infection. Typically, the subject is treated with an amount of a therapeutic composition sufficient to reduce a symptom of a disease or disorder, such as an infection, by at least about 25%, about 50%, about 75%, or about 90%.
The terms “treating”, “treat” and “treatment” can include (i) preventing a disease, pathologic or medical condition from occurring (e.g., prophylaxis); (ii) inhibiting the disease, pathologic or medical condition or arresting its development; (iii) relieving the disease, pathologic or medical condition; and/or (iv) diminishing symptoms associated with the disease, pathologic or medical condition. Thus, the terms “treat”, “treatment”, and “treating” can extend to prophylaxis and can include prevent, prevention, preventing, lowering, stopping or reversing the progression or severity of the condition or symptoms being treated. As such, the term “treatment” can include medical, therapeutic, and/or prophylactic administration, as appropriate.
Treatments may be reactive, such as for combating an existing infection, or prophylactic, for preventing infection in an organism susceptible to infection. In some embodiments, compositions can be used to treat infections by drug-resistant strains of bacteria, for example MRSA (methicillin resistant S. aureus), MRSE (methicillin resistant S. epidermidis), PRSP (penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae), VIRSA (vancomycin intermittently resistant Staphylococcus aureus) or VRE (vancomycin resistant Enterococci). The term “drug-resistant” a condition where the bacteria are resistant to treatment with one or more conventional antibiotics, particularly β-lactam antibiotics. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for killing or inhibiting growth of gram positive bacteria comprising contacting gram positive bacteria with a compound or composition described herein, thereby killing or inhibiting the growth of the bacteria. The contacting can be performed in vivo in a human or animal, or in vitro, for example, in an assay. The gram positive bacteria can be of the genus Enterococcus or Staphylococcus. In certain embodiments, the bacteria is a drug-resistant strain of the genus Staphylococcus. In certain specific embodiments, the bacteria is a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain.
In some embodiments, the bacterial infection may be due to Gram-positive bacteria, including, but not limited to, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CAMRSA), vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (VISA), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MR-CoNS), vancomycin-intermediate-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (VI-CoNS), methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant strains [PRSP]) and multi-drug resistant strains [MDRSP]), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis. In particular embodiments, the bacterial infection may include, but is not limited to, complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI); community acquired pneumonia (CAP); complicated intra-abdominal infections, such as, complicated appendicitis, peritonitis, complicated cholecystitis and complicated diverticulitis; uncomplicated and complicated urinary tract infections, such as, pyelonephritis; and respiratory and other nosocomial infections.
The term “infection” refers to the invasion of the host by germs (e.g., bacteria) that reproduce and multiply, causing disease by local cell injury, release of poisons, or germ-antibody reaction in the cells. The compounds and compositions described herein can be used to treat a gram positive bacterial infection, for example, an infection in a mammal, such as a human.
The terms “inhibit”, “inhibiting”, and “inhibition” refer to the slowing, halting, or reversing the growth or progression of a disease, infection, condition, or group of cells. The inhibition can be greater than about 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99%, for example, compared to the growth or progression that occurs in the absence of the treatment or contacting.
Phosphorylation of BlaR1 in Manifestation of the Methicillin-Resistance Phenotype in Staphylococcus aureus and its Abrogation by Small Molecules
We have now discovered that BlaR1 experiences phosphorylation at a minimum of one serine and one tyrosine in the cytoplasmic domain on exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. We also document that inhibition of this phosphorylation by small molecules reverses the methicillin-resistant phenotype, rendering MRSA susceptible to β-lactam antibiotics. Thus, the BlaR1 phosphorylation is an important step in regulation of the function of the protein, critical for the manifestation of the antibiotic-resistance phenotype. Whereas protein phosphorylation and its contribution to many regulatory events are widely known in eukaryotes, the same information relating to bacteria is significantly less understood. Nonetheless, S. aureus appears to have at least five protein kinases, which would contribute to these processes.
We investigated phosphorylation of BlaR1 in strain Staphylococcus aureus NRS128 (also designated as NCTC8325) on exposure to β-lactam antibiotics. This strain, which has the bla but not the mec operon, was grown in the absence or in the presence of 10 μg/mL CBAP (2-(2'-carboxyphenyl)-benzoyl-6-aminopenicillanate), a good penicillin inducer of resistance (Llarrull et al., J Biol. Chem., 2011, 286, 38148-38158). In a series of experiments that are outlined in the Examples below, we document by Western-blot analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-phosphoserine antibodies that the cytoplasmic domain of BlaR1 is phosphorylated at least on one tyrosine and one serine residue (FIGS. 2 and 3). The same experiment performed with an anti-phosphothreonine antibody documented the absence of threonine phosphorylation.
If phosphorylation of BlaR1 is important for the manifestation of resistance, it would be significantly valuable for treating bacterial infections if resistance to β-lactam antibiotics could be attenuated (or reversed) in the presence of protein-kinase inhibitors. The strain NRS128, used above, is not a PBP2a-dependent strain, hence we substitute it with S. aureus MRSA252 (also known as USA200) for the following experiments. This strain exhibits high-level resistance to β-lactam antibiotics due to its expression of PBP2a. Its genome has been sequenced (Holden et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., 2004, 101, 9786-9791) and it harbors the transposon Tn552, which encodes BlaR1. BlaR1 of MRSA252 has 99% sequence identity to that of NRS128. The minimal-inhibitory concentration (MIC) of oxacillin (a penicillin) against this strain is 256 μg/mL, consistent with high-level resistance.
A protein-kinase inhibitor library of 80 known compounds was tested in a 96-well format against strain MRSA252 for the screening. We first determined MICs (broth microdilution method) (CLSI, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Twenty-Second Informational Supplement. CLSI document M100-S22. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute; Wayne, Pa.) for all the inhibitors in the library, in case some of them might have antibacterial properties of their own, which could complicate the analysis.
Indeed, a few of these compounds did exhibit modest antibacterial activity on their own, and were not studied further. Subsequently, we investigated the bacterial growth in the presence of oxacillin concentrations of 256 (MIC), 128 (½ MIC), and 64 (¼ MIC) μg/mL and one of two fixed concentrations of the protein-kinase inhibitors without antibiotic property (0.7 μg/mL or 7 μg/mL). This rapid initial screening identified compound 1 as meeting the selection criteria of lowering the MIC for oxacillin, which was followed up by the actual evaluation of the MIC of oxacillin against S. aureus MRSA252 in the presence of the inhibitor. Inhibitor 1 at 7 μg/mL produced a reproducible four-fold decrease in the MIC of oxacillin for S. aureus MRSA252. The MIC of the kinase inhibitor alone against the same organism was ≧64 μg/mL.
Next, we tested the effect of exposure of CBAP-induced NRS128 to this kinase inhibitor. Cultures were induced with 10 μg/mL CBAP in the presence of 0, 7, or 17 μg/mL of compound 1. Whole-cell extracts of these bacteria were analyzed for BlaR1 phosphorylation by western blot using anti-Phos-Ser and anti-Phos-Tyr antibodies. Compound 1 inhibited both the phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine kinase activities by as much as 70-90% (FIG. 4). Hence, compound 1 lowered the degree of phosphorylation of BlaR1, and at the same time, the MIC for oxacillin was attenuated.
Compound 1 is a known mammalian serine/threonine-kinase inhibitor (Frantz et al., Biochemistry, 1998, 37, 13846-13853). That this compound inhibited the formation of phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine moieties in the BlaR1 protein was an important observation indicating that the kinase domain had a distinct structure that might make it a useful target for drug discovery. We undertook optimization of the structure of compound 1 for inhibition of the bacterial protein kinase(s) that phosphorylates BlaR1. More than 75 structural variants of compound 1 were synthesized and screened for the ability to lower the MIC for oxacillin and other β-lactam antibiotics. This involved diversification of the imidazole core at substituents attached to positions 2, 4, and 5.

Diversification at the imidazole C2 position was achieved using the methodology of Gallagher et al. for construction of imidazoles (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997, 5, 49-64), as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, compound 2 was treated with LDA, followed by Weinreb amide 3, to give the ketone 4. This intermediate was then allowed to react with various benzaldehydes in the presence of copper(II) acetate and ammonium acetate to give a library of C2-modified imidazoles.
<img> id-US20180044316A1-20180215-C00005.TIF </img>
For diversification at C4 and C5, we used metal-catalyzed coupling to sequentially install the desired rings onto the imidazole (Scheme 1). Thus, tribromoimidazole derivative 5 (Niculescu-Duvaz et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2010, 18, 6934-6952) was subjected to a Suzuki reaction with 4-isobutylphenylboronic acid to give C2-substituted imidazole 6. Suzuki reactions performed on 4,5-dibromoimidazoles such as 6 usually result in a mixture of mono- and di-coupled products (Recnik et al., Synthesis 2013, 45, 1387-1405). Therefore, 6 was converted to stannane 7 by lithiation and quenching with tributyltin chloride. Stannane 7 smoothly underwent Stille coupling (Liverton et al., J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 2180-2190) with either 4-iodopyridine or 4-fluoroiodobenzene to give 8 and 9, respectively. These intermediates were then subjected to Suzuki reactions with arylboronic acids or potassium aryltrifluoroborate salts, followed by deprotection to give the desired imidazole analogues.
We evaluated the new imidazole analogues for their ability to lower the MIC of oxacillin against MRSA in the same manner as for the kinase inhibitor library. In addition to MRSA252, we expanded our investigation to include strains NRS123 and NRS70, both of which have 95% sequence identities between their BlaR1 proteins and that of NRS128, with the bla operon encoded on plasmids (pMW2 and pN315, respectively). Interestingly, NRS123 also encodes for a truncated, nonfunctional MecR1 protein and lacks the gene for MecI, therefore PBP2a expression in this strain is regulated by the bla operon. The MIC of oxacillin against the resistant MRSA strains NRS123 and NRS70 are 16 and 32 μg/mL, respectively. Our inhibitors 10-12 exhibited remarkably improved activity in lowering the MIC of oxacillin. Notably, compounds 10-12 at 7 μg/mL are active across all three MRSA strains (Table 1).

We then evaluated the ability of compounds 10, 11 or 12 to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of BlaR1 in NRS70 extracts. The bacteria were grown under the conditions described earlier for NRS128, induced by CBAP in the absence and presence of 0.7 μg/mL or 7 μg/mL compounds 10, 11 or 12, and analyzed by western blot using antibody against phosphotyrosine (FIG. 5a). The presence of 7 μg/mL inhibitor almost completely abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of the BlaR1 fragment in all cases. However, serine phosphorylation was not inhibited by any of these compounds, even at 17 μg/mL (FIG. 6), in contrast to the case of 1, which had inhibited both. This provides evidence for the critical nature of tyrosine phosphorylation for regulation of BlaR1.
As we propose that phosphorylation is an activation step for the bla system, abrogation of phosphorylation should have an effect on expression of the resistance determinant(s). We have shown this to be the case in attenuation of the level of β-lactamase (product of the blaZ gene, FIG. 1). To document this, we monitored hydrolysis of the chromogenic β-lactam nitrocefin at A500 by β-lactamase expressed in the NRS70 culture media, according to the methodology reported previously (Llarrull et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 38148-38158). The initial rates of the reaction in the absence and presence of 7 μg/mL compound 10, 11 or 12 were normalized to the activity in the absence of inhibitor (FIG. 5b). As expected, the presence of compounds 10, 11 or 12 decreased the β-lactamase activity by ˜70-80%, congruent with the MIC data and western-blot analysis.
An observation by Tamber et al. that an stk1(pknB) gene knockout strain of the USA300 strain showed lower MIC values for β-lactam antibiotics is of interest (Tamber et al., Infect. Immun. 2010, 78, 3637-46). The gene pknB (also known as stk1) encodes a highly-conserved broad-specificity protein kinase in S. aureus that phosphorylates its substrates on serine, threonine or tyrosine. To confirm Stk1 is a protein target of the inhibitors in this study, we cloned the gene and expressed and purified Stk1 from S. aureus NRS70 (FIG. 7). We found that compounds 10, 11, and 12 inhibit Stk1 autophosphorylation with IC50 values of 3.1±0.8 μg/mL, 5±1 μg/mL, and 6±1 μg/mL, respectively. The compounds also inhibit phosphorylation of myelin-basic protein (MBP) by Stk1, with IC50 values of 2.1±0.6 μg/mL, 4±1 μg/mL, and 6±1 μg/mL, respectively (FIG. 8).
In conclusion, we have shown that the BlaR1 protein of MRSA is phosphorylated at a minimum of one serine and one tyrosine in response to challenge by β-lactam antibiotics, a step that is crucial in the signaling events leading to the induction of antibiotic resistance. The breadth of kinase/phosphatase-regulated processes in bacteria is likely vastly greater than is appreciated presently. This BlaR1 study represents the first insight as to the molecular-level regulation of a key resistance pathway in an important human pathogen. The documentation that inhibition of phosphorylation by small molecules reverses the MRSA phenotype makes available a new strategy to bring β-lactam antibiotics back from obsolescence in treatment of this insidious organism (Scheme 2, below).

Pharmaceutical Formulations
The compounds described herein can be used to prepare therapeutic pharmaceutical compositions, for example, by combining the compounds with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent, excipient, or carrier. The compounds may be added to a carrier in the form of a salt or solvate. For example, in cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic to form stable nontoxic acid or base salts, administration of the compounds as salts may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids that form a physiologically acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartrate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and β-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, halide, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid to provide a physiologically acceptable ionic compound. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example, calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be prepared by analogous methods.
The compounds of the formulas described herein can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient, in a variety of forms. The forms can be specifically adapted to a chosen route of administration, e.g., oral or parenteral administration, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.
The compounds described herein may be systemically administered in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle, such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. For oral administration, compounds can be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, compressed into tablets, or incorporated directly into the food of a patient's diet. Compounds may also be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations typically contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations can vary and may conveniently be from about 0.5% to about 60%, about 1% to about 25%, or about 2% to about 10%, of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions can be such that an effective dosage level can be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain one or more of the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; and a lubricant such as magnesium stearate. A sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring, may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
The active compound may be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, or mixtures thereof, or in a pharmaceutically acceptable oil. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
Pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions, dispersions, or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. The ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and/or antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers, or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and/or gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required, optionally followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, methods of preparation can include vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the solution.
For topical administration, compounds may be applied in pure form, e.g., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer the active agent to the skin as a composition or formulation, for example, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid, a liquid, a gel, or the like.
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina, and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), alcohols, glycols, or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which a compound can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using a pump-type or aerosol sprayer.
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses, or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.
Examples of dermatological compositions for delivering active agents to the skin are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,992,478 (Geria), 4,820,508 (Wortzman), 4,608,392 (Jacquet et al.), and 4,559,157 (Smith et al.). Such dermatological compositions can be used in combinations with the compounds described herein where an ingredient of such compositions can optionally be replaced by a compound described herein, or a compound described herein can be added to the composition.
Useful dosages of the compounds described herein can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949 (Borch et al.). The amount of a compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular compound or salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated, and the age and condition of the patient, and will be ultimately at the discretion of an attendant physician or clinician.
In general, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 10 to about 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day. In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of the invention formulated in such a unit dosage form.
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations.
The invention provides therapeutic methods of treating a bacterial infection in a mammal, which involve administering to a mammal having a bacterial infection an effective amount of a compound or composition described herein. A mammal includes a primate, human, rodent, canine, feline, bovine, ovine, equine, swine, caprine, bovine and the like. The ability of a compound of the invention to treat a bacterial infection may be determined by using assays well known to the art.

Preparation of Phosphorylation Inhibitors
General information. Reagents for chemical synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.) or Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, Mass., U.S.A.). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian DirectDrive 600 or a Varian INOVA-500 NMR spectrometer. High-resolution mass spectra were acquired on a Bruker microTOF/Q2 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) by electrospray ionization. Thin-layer chromatography was done on EMD Millipore (Billerica, Mass., U.S.A.) 0.25 mm silica gel 60 F254 plates. Column chromatography was done either manually using silica gel 60, 230-400 mesh (40-63 μm particle size) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., or on a Teledyne Combiflash Rf 200i automated chromatography system (Teledyne Isco, Lincoln, Nebr., U.S.A.) using disposable silica gel columns.

Phosphorylation of BlaR1 in Manifestation of the Methicillin-Resistance Phenotype in Staphylococcus aureus and its Reversal by Small Molecules
Experimental Procedures.
Bacterial strains. Staphylococcus aureus strain MRSA252 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va., U.S.A.); S. aureus strains NRS70, NRS123, and NRS128 were acquired from the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (NARSA, Chantilly, Va., U.S.A.).
Minimal-inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Determination of MICs was done by the microdilution method cation-adjusted in Mueller-Hinton II Broth (CAMHB II, BBL) in accordance with the protocols of CLSI (Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing; Twenty-Second Informational Supplement. CLSI document M100-S22. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute Wayne, Pa.). A final bacterial inoculum of 5×105 CFU/mL was used, and the results were recorded after incubation for 16-20 h at 37° C.
Detection of BlaR1 phosphorylation in presence of antibiotic. As we had disclosed in a recent publication on fragmentation of BlaR1 during the course of induction, we detect a cleavage at position S283-F284 of BlaR1 (Llarrull et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 38148-38158). This proteolytic cleavage cuts the BlaR1 protein into two fragments of roughly equal sizes (approx. 30-31 kDa). Zhang et al. identified another fragmentation site nearby, namely R293-R294 (Science 2001, 291, 1962-1965). In order to process these protein samples for identification of the phosphorylation sites, Staphylococcus aureus NRS128 was grown in LB media to OD625=0.7, then was allowed to grow an additional three hours at 37° C. in the absence or presence of 10 μg/mL CBAP, a good inducer of the bla system.
Extracts were prepared as previously described in buffer containing 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 0.55% SDS, 2.5% Triton X-100, and Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., U.S.A.) and analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against phosphothreonine, phosphotyrosine, and phosphoserine. A ˜30 kDa protein band was detected by the phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine specific antibodies only in cell extracts of S. aureus cells grown with CBAP (FIG. 2). This band was not detected by the phosphothreonine antibody.
Initially, we had an abundance of Protein A and other immunoglobulin-binding proteins detected in the western blot, which ran in the range of 40-60 kDa and precluded visualization of the full-length BlaR1. To overcome this, we subsequently cleared all S. aureus extracts of Protein A and other immunoglobulin-binding proteins by incubation with IgG Sepharose (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) for 1-2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After a brief centrifugation, the total protein in the supernatant was quantified by a BCA assay and 20 μg was loaded onto an 11% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, samples were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in a 10 mM CAPS (pH 11) buffer containing 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked in 3% BSA for phosphoserine blots or Blotto (3% BSA, 3% milk in TBS) for phosphotyrosine blots. HRP-conjugated primary antibody was applied in either 1% BSA/TBST (phosphoserine, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or 1.1% milk/TBST (phosphotyrosine, 4G10 Platinum, EMD Millipore, Billerica, Mass., U.S.A.). Phosphoserine blots were developed with Pierce ECL Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and phosphotyrosine blots were developed with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo Scientific), then exposed to X-ray film for an appropriate amount of time (30-600 s).
Monitoring β-lactamase expression by nitrocefin assay. The media from CBAP-induced cultures grown in the absence or presence of 7 μg/mL compounds 10, 11, or 12 was separated from the cells by centrifugation at 3200 g, at 4° C. for 30 min. The absorbance of hydrolyzed chromogenic nitrocefin was monitored at 500 nm at room temperature for 5 min by adding 100 μM nitrocefin to 1 mL culture media. The initial rates of the reactions were determined by linear regression and the activity was normalized to the activity in the absence of inhibitor to give % activity.
Identification of phosphorylated domain of BlaR1. As the two fragments of proteolyzed BlaR1 are roughly the same size, it is difficult to determine the site of phosphorylation without separation. To accomplish this, we immunoprecipitated whole-cell extracts of NRS128 grown in the absence and presence of CBAP using an antibody raised against the sensor domain of BlaR1 (BlaRs) immobilized on Protein A-agarose. BlaRs-Agarose resin for immunoprecipitation of S. aureus extracts was prepared as previously described (Llarrull et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2011, 286, 38148-38158) by crosslinking BlaRs antibody to Protein A Agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) with dimethylpimelimidate (DMP) in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 150 mM NaCl. Crosslinked resin was stored in PBS at 4° C.
Whole-cell extracts were first cleared of Protein A and other immunoglobulin-binding proteins (as described above), then were incubated with BlaRs-Agarose resin overnight at 4° C. with end-over-end rotation. Unbound protein was removed after centrifugation. Bound proteins (containing BlaRs, including full-length BlaR1) were eluted from the resin using Laemmli sample buffer. Unbound and bound fractions were loaded onto an 11% SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to western blot analysis with phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine, and BlaRs antibodies (FIG. 3).
Probing with the BlaRs antibody revealed the C-terminal BlaR1 fragment that contains the sensor domain only in the bound fraction (band at ˜30 kDa; arrow), while it revealed the full-length BlaR1 both in the bound and unbound fractions (band at ˜60 kDa; arrows). The presence of the full-length BlaR1 in the unbound fraction is not unexpected since its interaction with lipids (it has four transmembrane helixes) makes its affinity-purification less efficient. Probing with the phosphotyrosine antibody also revealed a band at ˜60 kDa both in the unbound and bound fractions. The correlation of the intensity of the full-length BlaR1 bands in the unbound and bound protein fractions of the membranes probed with the BlaRs antibody, with the intensity of the bands at ˜60 kDa in the unbound and bound protein fractions of the membranes probed with the phosphotyrosine antibody indicates that the phosphorylated protein is BlaR1. Probing with the phosphotyrosine antibody revealed a ˜30 kDa fragment only in the unbound fraction. This indicated that the site of tyrosine phosphorylation is located in the N-terminal fragment of BlaR1 (residues 1-283), which contains the cytoplasmic protease domain.
This observation makes good sense, as ATP, the source of phosphate, is found only in the cytoplasm. A repeat of these experiments with anti-phosphoserine antibody indicates that the N-terminal half is also phosphorylated at a serine (FIG. 3c). Incidentally, the protease domain contains eleven serine and ten tyrosine residues, any of which could be the sites of phosphorylation.
Cloning, expression, and purification of S. aureus Stk1 protein kinase. The stk1 gene for Stk1 protein kinase (SA1063 in S. aureus NRS70) is conserved in all known genomic sequences for S. aureus (Beltramini et al., Infect. Immun. 77, 1406-1416 (2009); Débarbouillé et al., J. Bacteriol. 191, 4070-4081 (2009); Didier et al., FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 306, 30-36 (2010)). We PCR-amplified the DNA fragment corresponding to the entire coding sequences of stk1 from S. aureus strain NRS70 chromosomal DNA with primers STK1fw (5'-CCCCCCCATATG ATAGGTAAAATAATAAATGAACGATAT-3') and STK1rev (5'-CCCCCCCTCGAG TTAAATATCATCATAGCTGACTTCTTTTTC-3'). The amplified DNA fragments were then digested with NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned into pET28a. After verification of the inserts by DNA sequencing on both strands, the resulting plasmid (termed pETstk1) was introduced into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for protein expression.
For purification of Stk1, 5 mL of an overnight culture of BL21(DE3) harboring pETstk1 was inoculated into 500 mL fresh LB medium and grown at 37° C. until the OD600 reached 0.8. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.5 mM and the culture was shaken at 15° C. overnight. The culture was then centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4° C. for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). After sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 g at 4° C. for 45 min. The resulting supernatant containing the His-tagged Stk1 was loaded onto a 5-mL Hitrap Chelating column (GE Healthcare), followed by elution with a linear gradient of imidazole (0-500 mM) in lysis buffer. The fractions containing Stk1 were pooled, concentrated and the buffer was exchanged to 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. The resulting sample was then subjected to Q anion-exchange chromatography and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0-1 M). Protein purity was ascertained by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (FIG. 7).
In vitro phosphorylation assay. The Stk1 protein kinase was assayed for its autophosphorylation (on serine and threonine residues) and for phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (MBP) (a commercially available, nonspecific substrate of Ser/Thr protein kinases). The assay was used for assessment of inhibition of the protein by the synthetic kinase inhibitors 10-12. The reaction was carried out in 20 μL of volume containing 1 μg purified Stk1, 4 μg MBP, varying concentrations of compound 10-12, in 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 10 mM MgCl2, initiated by the addition of 4 μCi [γ-32P]-ATP (20 μM). The assay mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min and it was stopped by the addition of 5×SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After boiling for 5 minutes, the mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gel was then exposed to storage phosphor screen overnight and the screen was scanned with an Amersham Storm 840. Band intensities were quantified using GelQuant software. The band intensities in the presence of compounds 10-12 were divided by the intensities in the absence of inhibitors to obtain the relative band intensities. Relative band intensities of the Stk1 or MBP bands were plotted against the concentration of compounds 10-12 (μM) (FIG. 8) and GraphPad Prism 5 was used to calculate the IC50 values by non-linear regression, using the equation Y=IC50/[IC50+X] as previously described (Dzhekieva et al., Biochemistry 51, 2804-2811 (2012)), with R2 values ranging from 0.87 to 0.91.

Compound MIC Data
The MIC values of more than 80 compounds were evaluated according to the methods described above. Each compound was evaluated at three or more different concentrations, typically: 0 (control), 2, and 20 μM. If the compound exhibited inherent antibacterial activity at 20 μM against the S. aureus strain, the compound was reevaluated at lower concentrations for the particular strain (e.g., 0, 0.1, and 1μM, or 0, 5, and 10 μM) to eliminate interference with the assay. Evaluation of compounds 1, A3, A4, A6, A10, A11, A12, A13, A14, A15, A16, A17, A18, A20, A21, A22, A34, A35, A37, A40, A42, A45, A53, A54, and A61 showed a greater than 2-fold decrease relative to the control.
