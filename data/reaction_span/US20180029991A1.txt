BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The research for novel and improved fungicidal compounds or compositions is continually needed because of the emergence and development of the fungi resistance to the existing fungicides after a period of applications.
The fungicidal activities of pyrazole amide and thiazolamide compounds have been disclosed. For example, pyrazole amide compounds KC1, KC2, KC3 and KC4 (compounds of 3, 2, 10 and 4 in the patent) were disclosed the structures and fungicidal activity in JP62249975. JP5657776 disclosed the thiazolamide structures and fungicidal activity of KC5 (compounds of 1 in the patent). Pesticide Science, 1993, 38(1): 1-7 disclosed the thiazolamide structures and fungicidal activity of KC6 (compound of XIV in the paper).

Some fungal diseases which under the class names listed above may be mentioned as example, but not by way of limitation.
Wheat rust, rice sheath blight, wheat sheath blight, cucumber downy mildew, grape downy mildew, wheat powdery mildew, tomato early blight, cucumber anthracnose, rice blast, wheat scab, wheat root rot, watermelon gummy stem blight, scab peanuts, peanut black spot, scab of citrus, tomato late blight, pepper root rot, cotton verticillium wilt, rape blackleg, take-all of wheat, banana leaf spot, wheat scab, pear scab, corn curvalaria leaf spot, cotton fusarium wilt disease, ginseng rust rot, corn leaf blight, stem rot disease of mango, cucumber blight, apple ring rot, apple valsa canker, rape sclertiniose, black leaf streak of banana, glume blight of wheat.
Another embodiment of this invention includes the fungicidal compositions, in which the compounds of general formula I are active ingredients. The weight percentage of active ingredient(s) in the compositions is from 1% to 99%. There are also acceptable carriers in agriculture in these compositions.
The compositions of the present invention can be used in the form of various formulations. Usually, amide (the compounds of general formula I) as the active ingredient can be dissolved in or dispersed to carriers or made to a formulation. So that they can be easily dispersed as a fungicide, such as a wettable powder or an emulsifiable concentrate, etc. Therefore, in these compositions, at least a liquid or solid carrier is added, and usually suitable surfactant(s) can be added when needed.
Also provided by this invention are the application methods of controlling diseases, which is to apply the compositions of the present invention to the growing loci of the fungi as above mentioned. The suitably effective dosage of the compounds of the present invention is usually within a range of from 10 g/ha to 1000 g/ha.
For some applications, one or more other fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators or fertilizer can be added into the fungicidal compositions of the present invention to make additional merits and effects.

2-methyl-3-(octan-2-yloxy)aniline (240 mg, 1.03 mmol), triethylamine (110 mg, 1.09 mmol) and dichloromethane (10 mL) were added to a flask, stirred at room temperature, then the solution of 3-(difluoromethyl)-5-fluoro-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbonyl chloride (210 mg, 0.99 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added dropwise. After being stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, water (30 mL) was added. The organic layer was successively washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporator. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Fluent: ethyl acetate/petroleum ether=1/2) to give the compound 28 (250 mg) in 60.8% yield.

After being stirred for 3 hours at room temperature, water (30 mL) was added. The organic layer was successively washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporator. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (Fluent: ethyl acetate/petroleum ether=1/5) to give the compound 71 (250 mg) in 57.0% yield.
The compounds of general formula I in the present invention can be prepared by the above-described methods.
BIOLOGICAL EXAMPLES
Example 3 Determination of Fungicidal Activity
Fungicidal activity of the compounds in the present invention against many kinds diseases were carried out. The procedure of fungicidal activity determination is as follows:
The fungicidal activity was tested in vivo manner on the potted plants. The test compounds of the present invention were dissolved in proper solvent (choosing the solvent according their dissolving ability to the compounds, the solvents could be acetone, methanol or N,N-dimethylformide, etc. The volume ratio between solvent and liquid sprayed was equal to or less than 0.05) and dilute with water contain 0.1% Tween 80 to given concentrations. Compounds of present invention was sprayed onto the leaves of seedling according to the designed concentration. Meanwhile, water was set as the blank control, three replicates were set for each treatment, the spore suspension were inoculated on the second day after treatment, then the plants were placed in an artificial climate chamber (temperature: day 25° C., night 20° C., relative humidity 95 to 100%). 24 hours later, the plants were moved to green house to cultivated. The plants which not need to control humidity was inoculated spore suspension in green house and cultivated in green house directly. The results were investigated after the plants were fully infected relative to the blank control (usually one week). The test resluts grading 100-0 refers to the <A Manual of Assessment Keys for Plant Diseases> which edited by American Phytopathological Society. “100” refer to no infection and “0” refer to the most serious infection
Some test results were listed as follows:
Protective effect against cucumber anthracnose (Colletotrichum orbiculare):
According the test method described above, the following compound among the test compounds exhibit good fungicidal activity against cucumber anthracnose at 400 ppm, the protective effect was 80% or more: compound 4.
Protective effect against cucumber downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk. et Curt.) Rostov)
According the test method described above, the following compounds among the test compounds exhibit good fungicidal activity against cucumber anthracnose at 400 ppm, the protective effect was 80% or more: compound 2, 4, 11, 13, 36, 70, 71, 102, 110 and 111.
According the test method described above, parallel test were carried out between compounds 2, 4, 11, 13, 71 and 111 of present invention and the known compounds KC1, KC2, KC3, KC4, KC5 and KC6 (The compounds were self-made and the structure was confirmed by 1H NMR consistent with the description of the procedures). The test results are listed in table 2.
