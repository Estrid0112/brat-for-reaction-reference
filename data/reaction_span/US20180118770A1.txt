BACKGROUND
The N-heterocyclic phosphine (NHP), a five-membered nitrogen containing heterocycle with a unit of -N-P(X)-N- (two P-N bonds and one P-X bond) (Ansell and Wills (2002) Chem. Soc. Rev. 31: 259; Zijp et al. (2005) Dalton Trans. 512; Chelucci et al. (2003) Tetrahedron 59: 9471), has emerged as a powerful synthetic tool in chemical synthesis since its first observation in 1964 (Scherer and Schmidt (1964) Angew. Chem. 76, 787). Traditional NHP-mediated reactions have contributed to both C-C and C-P bond-forming techniques because the focus on NHP chemistry has so far been predominantly directed to phosphorus-donor nucleophiles (Ansell and Wills (2002) Chem. Soc. Rev. 31: 259) that assist NHP in coordinating to metal complexes or in forming covalent bonds to electrophiles as ligands or auxiliaries. For example, chiral and achiral NHP ligands have been utilized to create C-C bonds in various transition metal-catalyzed transformations such as hydroformylation (Breeden et al. (2000) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39: 4106), Heck reactions (Wucher et al. (2011) PNAS 108: 8955), cross-coupling reactions (Ackermann et al. (2010) Org. Lett. 12: 1004), and allylic substitutions (Brunel et al. (1997) Tetrahedron Lett. 38: 5971).
In addition, chiral NHP-oxides of phosphorus-stabilized anions have been successfully employed as auxiliaries for stereoselective Pudovik-type reaction (De la Cruz et al. (1998) Tetrahedron 54: 10513; Blazis et al. (1995) J. Org. Chem. 60: 931) and Michael-type reaction (Hanessian et al. (2000) J. Org. Chem. 65: 5623; Hua et al. (1987) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 109: 5026; Denmark and Kim (1995) J. Org. Chem. 60: 7535) to form a C-P bond providing a stereogenic center to the NHP motifs. The widely known C-P bond forming Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction (Bhattacharya and Thyagarajan (1981) Chem. Rev. 81: 415; Arbuzov (1964) Pure Appl. Chem. 9: 307) utilizes a trialkyl phosphite P(III) and alkyl halide to access dialkyl alkylphosphonates P(V) via an elegant SN2 reaction sequence (Fernandez-Valle et al. (2015) J. Org. Chem. 80: 799; Buck and Yoke (1962) J. Org. Chem. 27: 3675). Since its discovery in 1898 (Michaelis and Kaehne (1898) Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 31: 1048), the Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction has served as a standard protocol for forming C-P bonds in versatile phosphonate derivatives such as phosphinate and phosphine oxide. Synthesis of such compounds, however, requires the use of aliphatic halides possessing good leaving groups and high temperature. Thus, for the search of more general and mild reaction conditions, attempts to expand the scope of the substrates within sp2 carbon-containing electrophiles were demonstrated by Perkow (Borowitz et al. (1972) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 94: 1623) and Dougherty (Kedrowski and Dougherty (2010) Org. Lett. 12:3990). Alternatively, efforts of seeking mild reaction conditions resulted in the finding of Lewis acid-mediated reactions (Raj eshwaran et al. (2011) Org. Lett. 13: 1270; Renard et al. (2003) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 42: 2389).
Despite the widespread utility of NHPs, there remains limitations in terms of the substrate scope, only spa- or sp2-carbon-containing electrophiles are tolerated, and reaction temperature, which increases the chance of side reaction (Fernandez et al. (2015) J. Org. Chem. 80: 799). These needs and others are met by the present invention.

Throughout this application, various publications are referenced. The disclosures of these publications in their entireties are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this pertains. The references disclosed are also individually and specifically incorporated by reference herein for the material contained in them that is discussed in the sentence in which the reference is relied upon. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such publication by virtue of prior invention. Further, the dates of publication provided herein may be different from the actual publication dates, which can require independent confirmation.
A. Definitions
As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a functional group,” “an alkyl,” or “a residue” includes mixtures of two or more such functional groups, alkyls, or residues, and the like.
Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about” one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular value. When such a range is expressed, a further aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be understood that the particular value forms a further aspect. It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as “about” that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed. For example, if 10 and 15 are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed.
References in the specification and concluding claims to parts by weight of a particular element or component in a composition denotes the weight relationship between the element or component and any other elements or components in the composition or article for which a part by weight is expressed. Thus, in a compound containing 2 parts by weight of component X and 5 parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in such ratio regardless of whether additional components are contained in the compound.
A weight percent (wt. %) of a component, unless specifically stated to the contrary, is based on the total weight of the formulation or composition in which the component is included.
As used herein, the terms “optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance can or cannot occur, and that the description includes instances where said event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.
It is appreciated that certain features of the disclosure, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate aspects, can also be provided in combination in a single aspect. Conversely, various features of the disclosure which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single aspect, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination.
For the terms “for example” and “such as,” and grammatical equivalences thereof, the phrase “and without limitation” is understood to follow unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The term “compound” as used herein is meant to include all stereoisomers, geometric isomers, tautomers, and isotopes of the structures depicted. Compounds herein identified by name or structure as one particular tautomeric form are intended to include other tautomeric forms unless otherwise specified.
All compounds, and salts thereof (e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable salts), can be found together with other substances such as water and solvents (e.g., hydrates and solvates).
Compounds provided herein also can include tautomeric forms. Tautomeric forms result from the swapping of a single bond with an adjacent double bond together with the concomitant migration of a proton. Tautomeric forms include prototropic tautomers that are isomeric protonation states having the same empirical formula and total charge. Example prototropic tautomers include ketone-enol pairs, amide-imidic acid pairs, lactam-lactim pairs, enamine imine pairs, and annular forms where a proton can occupy two or more positions of a heterocyclic system, for example, 1H- and 3H-imidazole, 1H-, 2H- and 4H-1,2,4-triazole, 1H- and 2H-isoindole, and 1H- and 2H-pyrazole. Tautomeric forms can be in equilibrium or sterically locked into one form by appropriate substitution.
Compounds provided herein can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include hydrogen, tritium, and deuterium.
The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
Also provided herein are pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein include the conventional non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds provided herein can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. In various aspects, a non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol, iso-propanol, or butanol) or acetonitrile (ACN) can be used. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977). Conventional methods for preparing salt forms are described, for example, in Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use, Wiley-VCH, 2002.
In various aspects, the compounds provided herein, or salts thereof, are substantially isolated. By “substantially isolated” is meant that the compound is at least partially or substantially separated from the environment in which it was formed or detected. Partial separation can include, for example, a composition enriched in the compounds provided herein. Substantial separation can include compositions containing at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, at least about 97%, or at least about 99% by weight of the compounds provided herein, or salt thereof. Methods for isolating compounds and their salts are routine in the art.
As used herein, chemical structures that contain one or more stereocenters depicted with dashed and bold bonds (i.e., ) are meant to indicate absolute stereochemistry of the stereocenter(s) present in the chemical structure. As used herein, bonds symbolized by a simple line do not indicate a stereo-preference. Unless otherwise indicated to the contrary, chemical structures, which include one or more stereocenters, illustrated herein without indicating absolute or relative stereochemistry encompass all possible stereoisomeric forms of the compound (e.g., diastereomers and enantiomers) and mixtures thereof. Structures with a single bold or dashed line, and at least one additional simple line, encompass a single enantiomeric series of all possible diastereomers.
Resolution of racemic mixtures of compounds can be carried out using appropriate methods. An exemplary method includes fractional recrystallization using a chiral resolving acid that is an optically active, salt-forming organic acid. Suitable resolving agents for fractional recrystallization methods are, for example, optically active acids, such as the D and L forms of tartaric acid, diacetyltartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, mandelic acid, malic acid, lactic acid, or the various optically active camphorsulfonic acids such as camphorsulfonic acid. Other resolving agents suitable for fractional crystallization methods include stereoisomerically pure forms of methylbenzylamine (e.g., S and R forms, or diastereomerically pure forms), 2-phenylglycinol, norephedrine, ephedrine, N-methylephedrine, cyclohexylethylamine, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, and the like.
Resolution of racemic mixtures can also be carried out by elution on a column packed with an optically active resolving agent (e.g., dinitrobenzoylphenylglycine). Suitable elution solvent compositions can be determined by one skilled in the art.
The expressions “ambient temperature” and “room temperature” as used herein are understood in the art and refer generally to a temperature, e.g., a reaction temperature, that is about the temperature of the room in which the reaction is carried out, for example, a temperature from about 20° C. to about 30° C.
At various places in the present specification, divalent linking substituents are described. It is specifically intended that each divalent linking substituent include both the forward and backward forms of the linking substituent. For example, -NR(CR'R″)n-includes both -NR(CR'R″)n- and -(CR'R″)nNR-. Where the structure clearly requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are understood to be linking groups.
The term “n-membered” where n is an integer typically describes the number of ring-forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, piperidinyl is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring, pyrazolyl is an example of a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, pyridyl is an example of a 6-membered heteroaryl ring, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.
As used herein, the phrase “optionally substituted” means unsubstituted or substituted. As used herein, the term “substituted” means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substituent. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency.
Throughout the definitions, the term “Cn-m” indicates a range that includes the endpoints, wherein n and m are integers and indicate the number of carbons. Examples include C1-4, C1-6, and the like.

B. N-Heterocyclic Phosphines
In one aspect, the invention relates to compounds useful in C-C and C-P bond-forming techniques. More specifically, in one aspect, the present invention relates to compounds useful in chemical reactions including, but not limited to, hydroformylations, Heck reactions, cross-coupling reactions, allylic substitutions, Pudoviktype reactions, Michael-type reactions, and Michaelis-Arbuzov reaction. The present invention further relates to compounds useful in the preparation of vinylphosphonates.
The disclosed N-heterocyclic phosphines (NHPs) are useful in, for example, generating phosphorus-carbon bonds under metal-free reaction conditions. As provided herein, one application of NHPs in organic synthesis is the formation of vinylphosphonates. In various aspects, the reaction of an appropriately substituted allene and NHP compound can promote a tandem Michael addition/Arbuzov reaction to generate vinylphosphonates. This process can deliver a regio- and stereoselective (e.g., E/Z ratio of about 6:1 to about 20:1) reaction via dual activation of the allene by a bi-functional NHP-thiourea scaffold which functions as Lewis base and Bronsted acid. Forming phosphorus-carbon bonds under metal-free reaction conditions is also useful in, for example, polymer synthesis, where metal impurities may impart undesirable material or thermal properties. Organophosphorus compounds (i.e., compounds having a P-C bond) are also useful, for example, as fire retardants and insecticides, and the production of these compounds via metal-free reactions is desirable.

As can be appreciated by one skilled in the art, the above reaction provides an example of a generalized approach wherein compounds similar in structure to the specific reactants above (compounds similar to compounds of type 23.1), can be substituted in the reaction to provide substituted vinylphosphonate analogs similar to Formula 5.1.
F. Representative Example of the Utility of Vinylphosphonates: Synthesis of Doxapram
Using the retrosynthetic analysis shown below, Compound 67 can be envisioned as a starting compound for the synthesis of Doxapram, a known respiratory stimulant.
Accordingly, the procedure for making vinylphosphonates as described herein could be applied to the synthesis of, for example, Doxapram, using an appropriately substituted NHP-thiourea and ethyl 2-phenylbuta-2,3-dienoate, as shown below.
Thus, reacting ethyl 2-phenylbuta-2,3-dienoate (3) with 1-(2-((1,3-diphenyl-1,3,2-diazaphospholidin-2-yl)oxy)ethyl)-3-phenylthiourea (66) in the presence of a solvent component (e.g., dichloromethane) affords vinyldiazaphosphonate 67. Functionalization of the vinyl group and reaction with ethane-1,2-dione affords compound 7A. The amino-ester moieties of 7A could then be cyclized in the presence of 2,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-1H-pyrimido[1,2-a]pyrimidine to afford intermediate 7B, which could subsequently be coupled to morpholine via reductive amination in the presence of a reducing agent (e.g., sodium cyanoborohydride) to afford 7C. Finally, aryl coupling of 7C in the presence of a strong base (e.g., lithium N-isopropylcyclohexylamide) would afford Doxapram.

1. General Experimental Methods
All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere in oven-dried glassware with magnetic stirring bar. Dry and degassed solvents were obtained by solvent purification system under argon. All commercially obtained reagents were used as received. Purification of reaction products was carried out by flash column chromatography using silica gel 60 (230-400 mash). Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed on 0.25 mm aluminum-backed silica gel 60-F plates. Visualization was accompanied with UV light and KMnO4 solution. Concentration in vacuo refers to the removal of volatile solvent using a rotary evaporator attached to a dry diaphragm pump (10-15 mm Hg) followed by pumping to a constant weight with an oil pump (<300 mTorr). 1H NMR spectra are recorded at 400 MHz and are recorded relative to CDCl3 (δ 7.26) or TMS (δ 0.00). 1H NMR coupling constants (J) are reported in Hertz (Hz) and multiplicities are indicated as follows: s (singlet), bs (broad singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m (multiplet), dd (doublet of doublet), dt (doublet of triplet). Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra are recorded at 100 MHz and are reported relative to CDCl3 (δ 77.16). 31P NMR spectra are recorded at 162 MHz and 31P chemical shifts are reported relative to 85% H3PO4 as an external standard.
a. PREPARATION OF N-HETEROCYCLIC PHOSPHINE CHLORIDE (NHP-CL)
The appropriate ethylene diamine (14.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dichloromethane (31 mL). The solution was cooled to 0° C. or −78° C. and PCl3 (14.1 mmol, 1.0 equiv) slowly added followed by triethylamine (28.2 mmol, 2.0 equiv) at same temperature. The mixture was stirred for 30 min at 0° C. or −78° C. and an additional 90 min at room temperature. On completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC analysis), the volatiles were removed in vacuo, and the residue was extracted in THF, filtered through a pad of diatomaceous earth and the filtrates were concentrated under vacuum to obtain pure product as off-white solid.
b. GENERAL SYNTHESIS OF N-HETEROCYCLICPHOSPHINE THIOUREA (NHP-THIOUREA) CATALYSTS
To a solution of the appropriate NHP-Cl (3.61 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in DCM or toluene (25 mL) was added a hydroxythiourea compound (3.61 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and triethylamine (4.33 mmol, 1.2 equiv) at 0° C. After 2 h stirring at room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted in DCM, washed with aq. sat. NaHCO3 solution, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude product was purified by chromatography over silica gel (eluting with 15-20% EtOAc/hexanes) to give the corresponding NHP-thiourea as colorless solid.
The following NHP-thiourea catalysts were preparing according the procedure described above using the appropriate NHP-Cl and hydroxythiourea compounds.

2. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF N-HETEROCYCLIC PHOSPHINE-PROMOTED MICHAEL/INTRAMOLECUAR ARBUZOV CASCADE REACTION (NPMAC)
Without wishing to be bound by theory, a conceptual description of this bi-functional NHP-promoted C-P bond forming reaction with allene is presented above. The NHP with enhanced nucleophilicity by the lone pairs and substituents on nitrogen may initiate the addition of phosphorus nucleophile to the sp carbon of allene. This phospha-Michael addition (Enders et al. (2006) Eur. I Org. Chem. 2006: 29; Keglevich et al. (2008) Heteroat. Chem. 19: 288) to allene could be accelerated by the activated allenoates through H-bonding (Hoashi et al. (2005) Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 44: 4032; Okino et al. (2005) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 127: 119; Hoashi et al. (2004) Tetrahedron Lett. 45: 9185; Xiao et al. (2014) Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 10: 2089; Guang and Zhao (2013) Tetrahedron let. 54: 5703) H. The concept of bi-functional NHP in merging NHP with Bronsted acid can be demonstrated by the dual role in H-bonding activation of the allene and a proton donor to the enolate intermediate. The anionic thiourea and polar P-O bond (Gudat (2010) In Phosphorus Heterocycles II; Bansal, R. K., Ed.; Springer Berlin Heidelberg: 2010; Vol. 21, p 63) would then induce the C-O bond cleavage via an intramolecular Arbuzov-type reaction (Breen et al. (2009) Org. Biomol. Chem. 7: 178; Catan et al. (2011) Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2011: 6857; Bernacki et al. (2010) Org. Lett. 12: 5526; Guzaev and Manoharan (2001) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 123: 783) corresponding to the formation of P═O bond of vinyldiazaphosphonate I. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this reaction strategy may avoid high reaction temperature conditions and metal reagents to achieve the synthesis of vinylphosphonates J.
3. OPTIMIZATION OF NPMAC REACTION
The envisioned concept of a bifunctional NHP began by investigating the synthesis in which NHPCl was treated with 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-phenylthiourea. With the bi-functional NHP in hand, the reactivity with electrophile 2a was explored (Table 1). A screening study of solvents (see Solvent Screening below) quickly identified DCM as the desired solvent for this transformation (entry 2, >99%). An initial reaction between bi-functional NHP la and ethylallenoate 2a was carried out to find an optimal amount of the electrophile with a slight excess (entry 2). Afterwards, the optimization studies of the bi-functional NHP were performed with 3 equiv of electrophile in DCM. A study of electronic and steric effects of the NHP with different substituents revealed that a bulky substituent on NHP significantly reduces the efficiency of the reaction (entry 4), whereas the electronic nature has a negligible effect on product yields (entry 3, 5).

4. EXPLORATION OF REACTION SCOPE
With the optimized reaction conditions established, the scope of the reaction was explored using various electrophiles and the NHP-thiourea 1a (Table 2). α- or γ-Substituted allenes with a wide range of electronwithdrawing substituents underwent clean reactions to afford desired products in moderate to excellent yields (31-99% yields). Moderately electron-withdrawing substituents on allenes (2a, 2e) were necessary to achieve high yields (3a-99%, 3e-95%); however, stronger electronwithdrawing groups (2f, 2h-j) than the ester group or a bulky ester group on the allene (2g) diminished the product yields (3f-j). The vinyldiazaphosphonate structure 3a was unambiguously determined by single crystal X-ray analysis providing scis conformation (see FIG. 3). In general, the use of allenoates with substituents gave low product yields, presumably due to steric encumbrance in addition to the β-carbon. Nonetheless, strong electronwithdrawing groups on asubstituents (2t, 2u) overcome this steric issue (3t-91%, 3u-90%). Without wishing to be bound by theory, this different reactivity may be attributed to more reactive allenes, which are activated by strong electronwithdrawing substituents. An excellent E/Z stereoselectivity was observed from allenes with γ-aryl or -branched substituents providing only E-olefin products (3z, 3aa, 3ab). Moreover, the tetrasubstituted alkenes, otherwise challenging to synthesize, were obtained with moderate to excellent yields (3ac-91%, 3ad-94%). Indeed, all allene electrophiles proceed with complete regioselectivity to provide only the β-addition products.
5. VERSATILITY OF VINYLDIAZAPHOSPHONATES
The vinyldiazaphosphonate is a versatile compound, which was subjected to further synthetic manipulations (see above). A selective reduction of phosphonate ester to alcohol 4a was achieved with DIBAL-H (Moriwake et al. (1986) Chem. Lett. 15: 815). With potential application of halogenated vinlyphosphonates as flame retardants (Nametz (1967) Ind. Eng. Chem. 59: 99), bromination of 3a was performed to demonstrate a selective aryl halogenation to generate 4b. Additionally, conversion of the parent vinlydiazaphosphonate 3a to vinylphosphonate 4c proceeded smoothly in presence of ethonolic HCl with excellent yield (92%). Moreover, the presence of acidic aproton on vinyldiazaphosphonate leads to alkylation 3k (70%) and isomerization 4d (>99%). Finally, with an attempt to functionalize the vinyl group of 3a to a diol, the feasibility of tandem dihydroxylation/lactonization of 3a was demonstrated to provide a phosphono lactone 4e (Dupau et al. (2002) Adv. Synth. Catal. 344: 421; Jackson et al. (1989) J. Org. Chem. 54: 4750).
6. PRELIMINARY PROPOSED REACTION PATHWAY
Based on these results, a preliminary reaction pathway was proposed (see above). Without wishing to be bound by theory, Michael addition of the bi-functional NHP 1a to an allenoate 2a, which could be activated by combination of both nucleophilic NHP and H-bonding activation with Bronsted acids, may account for the construction of C-P bond. The following proton transfer/tautomerization may leverage the cascade process of intramolecular Arbuzov reaction to provide vinyldiazaphosphonate 3a. This reaction protocol has demonstrated a bi-functional role of NHP in N-heterocyclic Phosphinepromoted Michael/intramolecuar Arbuzov Cascade reaction (NPMAC).
