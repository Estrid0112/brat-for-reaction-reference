BACKGROUND AND FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present disclosure is generally directed to compounds useful for modulating sweetness profile of a sweetener.
The food and beverage industry has become interested in high potency sweeteners such as steviol glycosides in the pursuit of alternative sweeteners. However, replacing nutritive sweeteners with known potent non-nutritive sweeteners is difficult due to off-tastes associated with these sweeteners, for example slow on-set, bitter, licorice, or lingering aftertastes. Thus, there remains a need to develop sweetener compositions that better mimic the taste profile as sugar.

The compound of Formula I as described herein (e.g., GSA) can be used in combination of various sweeteners. While not wishing to be bound by theories, it is believed that the compound of Formula I can enhance the sweet taste receptor through positive allosteric modulation of the receptor. For example, as discussed in the Examples section, GSA in a pure form was tested by human tasting and was found to be effective in increasing the overall sweetness of a nutritive sweetener (e.g., high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)) sweetened beverages; decreasing the sweetness time-of-onset for high potency sweeteners such as rebaudioside A; decreasing bitter, metallic and licorice off-notes of high potency sweeteners (e.g., a 300 ppm solution of Rebaudioside A in phosphate buffer); and improving the sweet quality of sweetened beverages.
In various embodiments, the present disclosure provides a sweetener composition comprising a compound of Formula I and a sweetener. Suitable compounds of Formula I and sweeteners include any of those described herein.
Various amounts of the compound of Formula I (e.g., GSA) can be added to the sweetener composition to modify the sweetness profile of the sweetener. Any amount effective in modifying the sweetness profile of the sweetener can be included in the sweetener composition. For example, in some embodiments, the amount of the compound of Formula I can be included in the sweetener composition sufficient to decrease the sweetness time-of-onset, decrease bitter, metallic and licorice off-notes, and/or improve sweet quality (e.g., roundness) of the sweetener. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the compound of Formula I (e.g., GSA) in the sweetener composition can range from about 30 ppm to about 300 ppm (e.g., about 30 ppm, about 50 ppm, about 100 ppm, about 150 ppm, about 200 ppm, about 250 ppm, about 300 ppm, or any ranges between the recited values). In other embodiments, the concentration of the compound of Formula I can be at least 30 ppm (e.g., at least 50 ppm, at least 100 ppm, at least 150 ppm, at least 200 ppm, at least 250 ppm, or at least 300 ppm).
Various ratios of the compound of Formula I (e.g., GSA) to the sweetener are suitable for the sweetener composition described herein. For example, in some embodiments, the sweetener is a nutritive sweetener and the ratio of the compound of Formula I to the sweetener can range from about 1:400 to about 1:20 by weight, and in certain embodiments, from about 1:250 to about 1:50 by weight. In certain embodiments, the sweetener is a non-nutritive sweetener and the ratio of the compound of Formula I to the non-nutritive sweetener can be from about 3:1 to about 1:3 by weight, and in certain embodiments, from about 1.2:1 to about 1:1.2 by weight.
Sweetener
The sweeteners included in the sweetener compositions disclosed herein are edible consumables. The sweetener can be a nutritive or non-nutritive, natural or synthetic sweetener, or a combination of such sweeteners, so long as the sweetener or combination of sweeteners provides a taste which is perceived as sweet by the sense of taste. The perception of flavoring agents and sweetening agents can depend to some extent on the interrelation of elements. Flavor and sweetness can also be perceived separately, i.e., flavor and sweetness perception can be both dependent upon each other and independent of each other. For example, when a large amount of a flavoring agent is used, a small amount of a sweetening agent can be readily perceptible and vice versa. Thus, the oral and olfactory interaction between a flavoring agent and a sweetening agent can involve the interrelationship of elements.
When used to sweeten, the sweetener or combination of sweeteners in the sweetener composition is present in an amount above the sweeteners' sweetness recognition threshold concentration.
In certain embodiments, one or more nutritive sweeteners can be present in the sweetener composition in an amount of from about 1% to about 20% by weight of the sweetener composition, such as from about 3% to about 16% by weight, or from about 5% to about 12% by weight, depending upon the desired level of sweetness in the sweetener composition.
In certain embodiments, non-nutritive sweeteners can be present in the sweetener composition in an amount ranging from about 1 ppm to about 600 ppm (e.g., about 1 ppm, about 10 ppm, about 50 ppm, about 100 ppm, about 200 ppm, about 300 ppm, about 400 ppm, about 500 ppm, about 600 ppm, or any ranges between the recited values), depending upon the particular non-nutritive sweetener(s) being used and the desired level of sweetness in the sweetener composition.

Example 2. General Procedures for Testing Sweet/Flavor Modifying Ingredients
Sample Preparation Protocol
For testing the material as a sweet/flavor modifying ingredient, two samples were prepared: a 4° Brix high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) control solution and a 4° Brix HFCS solution with a known concentration of test ingredient.
Sample Preparation
4° Brix HFCS control solution was prepared by adding 50.89 grams of 78.60° Brix HFCS to 1000 g phosphoric acid base which was prepared by adding phosphoric acid dropwise into 1 L of Aquafina Water until pH 3.1 was obtained. pH was measured using a METTLER TOLEDO pH meter.
In the case of a different Brix of HFCS starting syrup, the following formula can be used for the amount of HFCS required to make HFCS control solution.
<in-line-formulae>4° Brix/100*1000 mL/(78.5° Brix/100)=50.96</in-line-formulae>
If any cloudiness persisted, the sample solution was passed through a paper filter. For some low soluble compounds, Branson 2800 Ultra Sonic Bath was used to dissolve the material. If any cloudiness persisted, the sample solution was passed through a paper filter. Solubility was confirmed by shining a laser pointer through the solution. If no diffraction was observed then it was assumed that the material was soluble.
Instructions for Tasters
For each test, 12-16 tasters were presented with these two (2) numbered samples and asked to note the sweet quality differences between the two samples. Tasters were also asked to comment on sweetness onset, sweetness linger, overall sugarlike sweetness and other qualities such as bitter taste, metallic note, astringency, cooling sensation, any offnotes and any associated flavors. Tasters were also asked to assess sample odor differences and provide any descriptions.
Tasters were asked to not to eat at least 1 hour before tasting and rinse with Aquafina water at least 5 times between tasting all samples.
Compound 5 was added at 35 ppm to 4 Brix HFCS in phosphoric acid (as described above). This solution was compared with 4 Brix HFCS in phosphoric acid. A majority of tasters noted a difference and reported qualities such as “rounder sweetness”, “more sugar-like” and “earlier onset” for the solution containing compound 5.
