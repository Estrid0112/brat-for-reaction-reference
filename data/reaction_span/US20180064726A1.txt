TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates generally to the field of pharmaceuticals and to methods of treating disorders. More particularly, provided herein are novel compounds which are inhibitors of the late sodium current and are useful in treating or preventing disorders including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
BACKGROUND
The late sodium current (INaL) is a component of the fast Na+ current of cardiac myocytes and neurons. Late sodium current in cardiac cells is small compared with the fast component, but it may make a large contribution to sodium loading during each cardiac cycle. Impaired sodium channel function contributes to pathologic increase of the late sodium current, sodium overload, and sodium-induced calcium overload by way of the sodium-calcium exchanger. Calcium overload causes impaired diastolic relaxation, which increases diastolic wall tension, increases myocardial oxygen demand, reduces myocardial blood flow and oxygen supply, microvascular perfusion, and worsens ischemia and angina. Many common neurological and cardiac conditions are associated with abnormal (INaL) augmentation, which contributes to the pathogenesis of both electrical and contractile dysfunction in mammals. Inhibiting the late sodium current can lead to reductions in elevated intracellular calcium levels, which, in turn, may lead to reduced tension in the heart wall and reduced oxygen requirements for the heart muscle. Inhibition of cardiac late sodium current is a strategy used to suppress arrhythmias and sodium-dependent calcium overload associated with myocardial ischemia and heart failures. Thus, compounds that selectively inhibit the late sodium current (INaL) in mammals may be useful in treating such disease states.
Eleclazine (4-(pyrimidin-2-ylmethyl)-7-(4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl)-3,4-dihydrobenzo[b]oxepin-5(2H)-one]; CAS #1443211-72-0) is an inhibitor of the late sodium current. Eleclazine is being investigated for the treatment of cardiomyopathy, specifically hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as well as additional cardiovascular indications, including angina, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF), ischaemic heart disorders, atrial premature beats (APBs), myocardial ischemia, and arrhythmias.

Eleclazine shows a shortening of the QTc interval (the time interval between the start of the Q-wave and the end of T-wave in the electrical cycle of the heart) in patients with QT-3 (LQT3) syndrome. LQTS is a genetic disorder that prolongs the heart's QTc interval and can cause life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, eleclazine is also being investigated for treatment of long QT syndrome.
Eleclazine may be metabolized in the liver and may be subject to extensive cytochrome P450-mediated oxidative metabolism. Eleclazine is metabolized predominantly by N-dealkylation, and elimination is principally in the bile and gastrointestinal tract. The primary metabolite of eleclazine is GS-623134
Adverse effects associated with eleclazine may include dizziness, dry mouth, nausea, weakness, ringing in ears, tremors, and the like. Additionally, some metabolites of eleclazine, particularly the metabolite GS 623134, may have undesirable side effects.
Accordingly, there is a need for ion modulators, particularly late sodium current inhibitors, with improved pharmacokinetic properties.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Before describing several exemplary embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the details of construction or process steps set forth in the following description. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out in various ways.
All publications and references cited herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. However, with respect to any similar or identical terms found in both the incorporated publications or references and those explicitly put forth or defined in this document, then those terms definitions or meanings explicitly put forth in this document shall control in all respects.
Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect
In order to eliminate foreign substances such as therapeutic agents, the animal body expresses various enzymes, such as the cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), esterases, proteases, reductases, dehydrogenases, and monoamine oxidases, to react with and convert these foreign substances to more polar intermediates or metabolites for renal excretion. Such metabolic reactions frequently involve the oxidation of a carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond to either a carbon-oxygen (C-O) or a carbon-carbon (C-C) π-bond. The resultant metabolites may be stable or unstable under physiological conditions, and can have substantially different pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and acute and long-term toxicity profiles relative to the parent compounds. For most drugs, such oxidations are generally rapid and ultimately lead to administration of multiple or high daily doses.
The relationship between the activation energy and the rate of reaction may be quantified by the Arrhenius equation, k=Ae−Eact/RT. The Arrhenius equation states that, at a given temperature, the rate of a chemical reaction depends exponentially on the activation energy (Eact).
The transition state in a reaction is a short lived state along the reaction pathway during which the original bonds have stretched to their limit. By definition, the activation energy Eact for a reaction is the energy required to reach the transition state of that reaction. Once the transition state is reached, the molecules can either revert to the original reactants, or form new bonds giving rise to reaction products. A catalyst facilitates a reaction process by lowering the activation energy leading to a transition state. Enzymes are examples of biological catalysts.
Carbon-hydrogen bond strength is directly proportional to the absolute value of the ground-state vibrational energy of the bond. This vibrational energy depends on the mass of the atoms that form the bond, and increases as the mass of one or both of the atoms making the bond increases. Since deuterium (D) has twice the mass of protium (1H), a C-D bond is stronger than the corresponding C-1H bond. If a C-1H bond is broken during a rate-determining step in a chemical reaction (i.e. the step with the highest transition state energy), then substituting a deuterium for that protium will cause a decrease in the reaction rate. This phenomenon is known as the Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (DKIE). The magnitude of the DKIE can be expressed as the ratio between the rates of a given reaction in which a C-1H bond is broken, and the same reaction where deuterium is substituted for protium. The DKIE can range from about 1 (no isotope effect) to very large numbers, such as 50 or more. Substitution of tritium for hydrogen results in yet a stronger bond than deuterium and gives numerically larger isotope effects
Deuterium (2H or D) is a stable and non-radioactive isotope of hydrogen which has approximately twice the mass of protium (1H), the most common isotope of hydrogen. Deuterium oxide (D2O or “heavy water”) looks and tastes like H2O, but has different physical properties.
When pure D2O is given to rodents, it is readily absorbed. The quantity of deuterium required to induce toxicity is extremely high. When about 0-15% of the body water has been replaced by D2O, animals are healthy but are unable to gain weight as fast as the control (untreated) group. When about 15-20% of the body water has been replaced with D2O, the animals become excitable. When about 20-25% of the body water has been replaced with D2O, the animals become so excitable that they go into frequent convulsions when stimulated. Skin lesions, ulcers on the paws and muzzles, and necrosis of the tails appear. The animals also become very aggressive. When about 30% of the body water has been replaced with D2O, the animals refuse to eat and become comatose. Their body weight drops sharply and their metabolic rates drop far below normal, with death occurring at about 30 to about 35% replacement with D2O. The effects are reversible unless more than thirty percent of the previous body weight has been lost due to D2O. Studies have also shown that the use of D2O can delay the growth of cancer cells and enhance the cytotoxicity of certain antineoplastic agents.
Deuteration of pharmaceuticals to improve pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicity profiles has been demonstrated previously with some classes of drugs. For example, the DKIE was used to decrease the hepatotoxicity of halothane, presumably by limiting the production of reactive species such as trifluoroacetyl chloride. However, this method may not be applicable to all drug classes. For example, deuterium incorporation can lead to metabolic switching. Metabolic switching occurs when xenogens, sequestered by Phase I enzymes, bind transiently and re-bind in a variety of conformations prior to the chemical reaction (e.g., oxidation). Metabolic switching is enabled by the relatively vast size of binding pockets in many Phase I enzymes and the promiscuous nature of many metabolic reactions. Metabolic switching can lead to different proportions of known metabolites as well as altogether new metabolites. This new metabolic profile may impart more or less toxicity. Such pitfalls are non-obvious and are not predictable a priori for any drug class.
Eleclazine is a late sodium current inhibitor. The carbon-hydrogen bonds of eleclazine contain a naturally occurring distribution of hydrogen isotopes, namely 1H or protium (about 99.9844%), 2H or deuterium (about 0.0156%), and 3H or tritium (in the range between about 0.5 and 67 tritium atoms per 1018 protium atoms). Increased levels of deuterium incorporation may produce a detectable Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect (DKIE) that could affect the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic and/or toxicologic profiles of such eleclazine in comparison with the compound having naturally occurring levels of deuterium.
Based on discoveries made in our laboratory, as well as considering the literature, eleclazine is likely metabolized in humans by oxidation of hydrocarbons and N-dealkylations. The approach described herein has the potential to prevent metabolism at these sites. Other sites on the molecule may also undergo transformations leading to metabolites with as-yet-unknown pharmacology/toxicology. Limiting the production of these metabolites has the potential to decrease the danger of the administration of such drugs and may even allow increased dosage and/or increased efficacy. All of these transformations can occur through polymorphically-expressed enzymes, exacerbating interpatient variability. Further, some disorders are best treated when the subject is medicated around the clock or for an extended period of time. For all of the foregoing reasons, a pharmaceutical with a longer half-life may result in greater efficacy and cost savings. Various deuteration patterns can be used to (a) reduce or eliminate unwanted metabolites, (b) increase the half-life of the parent drug, (c) decrease the number of doses needed to achieve a desired effect, (d) decrease the amount of a dose needed to achieve a desired effect, (e) increase the formation of active metabolites, if any are formed, (f) decrease the production of deleterious metabolites in specific tissues, and/or (g) create a more effective drug and/or a safer drug for polypharmacy, whether the polypharmacy be intentional or not. The deuteration approach has the strong potential to slow the metabolism of eleclazine and attenuate interpatient variability.

As used herein, the term “deuterium enrichment” refers to the percentage of incorporation of deuterium at a given position in a molecule in the place of hydrogen. For example, deuterium enrichment of 1% at a given position means that 1% of molecules in a given sample contain deuterium at the specified position. Because the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium is about 0.0156%, deuterium enrichment at any position in a compound synthesized using non-enriched starting materials is about 0.0156%. The deuterium enrichment can be determined using conventional analytical methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
As used herein, the term “is/are deuterium,” when used to describe a given position in a molecule such as R1-R16 or the symbol “D,” when used to represent a given position in a drawing of a molecular structure, means that the specified position is enriched with deuterium above the naturally occurring distribution of deuterium. In one embodiment deuterium enrichment is no less than about 1%, in another no less than about 5%, in another no less than about 10%, in another no less than about 20%, in another no less than about 50%, in another no less than about 70%, in another no less than about 80%, in another no less than about 90%, or in another no less than about 98% of deuterium at the specified position.
As used herein, the term “isotopic enrichment” refers to the percentage of incorporation of a less prevalent isotope of an element at a given position in a molecule in the place of the more prevalent isotope of the element.
As used herein, the term “non-isotopically enriched” refers to a molecule in which the percentages of the various isotopes are substantially the same as the naturally occurring percentages.

As used herein, the term “nonrelease controlling excipient” refers to an excipient whose primary function do not include modifying the duration or place of release of the active substance from a dosage form as compared with a conventional immediate release dosage form.
As used herein, the term “prodrug” refers to a compound functional derivative of the compound as disclosed herein and is readily convertible into the parent compound in vivo. The term “prodrug” denotes a compound which, upon administration to a subject, undergoes chemical conversion by metabolic or chemical processes to yield a compound of the formula, and/or a salt and/or solvate thereof. For example, compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters which serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield formula compounds per se. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have enhanced solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent compound. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis.
The term “prodrug” as employed herein includes esters and carbonates formed by reacting compounds of formula I with alkyl, alkoxy, or aryl substituted acylating agents employing procedures known to those skilled in the art to generate acetates, pivalates, methyl carbonates, benzoates, and the like.

Such carriers enable the pharmaceutical compositions to be formulated as tablets, pills dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions, and the like, for ingestion, application, or inhalation by the patient. In addition to the active ingredients (e.g. the compounds of structural Formula I), the pharmaceutical compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Techniques for formulation and administration are known in the art.
The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured in any manner known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be formulated as a modified release dosage form, including delayed-, extended-, prolonged-, sustained-, pulsatile-, controlled-, accelerated- and fast-, targeted-, programmed-release, and gastric retention dosage forms. These dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art.
The compositions include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, and intramedullary), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. Such compositions may be present in the form of a gel, paste, ointment, cream, lotion, liquid suspension, dispersion, emulsions, micro-emulsions, microcapsules, microparticles, vesicular dispersions, and the like.
The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Typically, these methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the subject invention or a pharmaceutically salt, prodrug, or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.
Formulations of the compounds disclosed herein suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.
Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol.

Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.
The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.
For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides.
Certain compounds disclosed herein may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound disclosed herein externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.
Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose.
For administration by inhalation, compounds may be delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator.
Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient.
Compounds may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5 mg to 2 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of one or more compounds which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg.
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration.
The compounds can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the disorder being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the disorder and its severity.
In the case wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disorder.
In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”).
Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disorder is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment (i.e., administration) on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.

General Synthetic Methods for Preparing Compounds
Isotopic hydrogen can be introduced into a compound as disclosed herein by synthetic techniques that employ deuterated reagents, whereby incorporation rates are pre-determined; and/or by exchange techniques, wherein incorporation rates are determined by equilibrium conditions, and may be highly variable depending on the reaction conditions. Synthetic techniques, where tritium or deuterium is directly and specifically inserted by tritiated or deuterated reagents of known isotopic content, may yield high tritium or deuterium abundance, but can be limited by the chemistry required. Exchange techniques, on the other hand, may yield lower tritium or deuterium incorporation, often with the isotope being distributed over many sites on the molecule.
The compounds disclosed herein can be prepared by methods known to one of skill in the art and routine modifications thereof, and/or following procedures similar to those described in the Example section herein and routine modifications thereof, and/or procedures found in U.S. Pat.
