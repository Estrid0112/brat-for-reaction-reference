The present disclosure relates to anticancer agents that function as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization.
The colchicine site located on the β-subunit of the α,β-tubulin heterodimer continues to serve as a rich and productive target for a wide-range of structurally diverse small-molecule anticancer agents. Through a direct binding interaction at the colchicine site, these compounds inhibit the polymerization (assembly) of the tubulin heterodimer into microtubules. Disruption of the inherent dynamic relationship between microtubules and tubulin heterodimers has led to two mechanistically distinct, yet complementary, cancer treatment strategies. One approach centers on the well-known cytotoxic effect that results when disruption of the tubulin-microtubule system, caused by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of tubulin polymerization or depolymerization, impacts the ability of cancer cells to divide. A wide-range of small-molecule therapeutic agents has been discovered and developed that function as antiproliferative agents through this mechanism, including those shown in FIG. 1. As shown in FIG. 1, representative small-molecule anti-proliferative agents including colchicine, paclitaxel, CA4, vinblastine, OXi6196, KGP18, KGP156, OXi8006, and BNC105.
This approach, while productive as an anticancer strategy, has limitations and challenges since both neoplastic and healthy cells are potentially impacted. Targeting strategies such as the use of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) bearing active payloads have been successful with two FDA approved ADCs currently available. In another example, the targeting of tumor hypoxia with bioreductively activatable prodrug conjugates (BAPCs) has been explored with recent clinical trials involving PR-104 and TH-302 serving as representative examples. The structures of PR-104 and TH-302 are shown in FIG. 2.
A second mechanistic approach to cancer therapy involving inhibition of the tubulin-microtubule protein system centers on selective disruption of existing vasculature feeding tumors, leading to limitation of oxygen and nutrient delivery to the cells and impedance of the ability of these cells to clear cellular waste products. This ultimately leads to tumor necrosis. This approach to targeting existing tumor-feeding vasculature utilizes anticancer agents referred to as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) and is unique and mechanistically distinct from the fairly well-established and more commonly described therapeutic approach employing angiogenesis inhibiting agents (AIAs) that impede the formation of new vessels. Rapid neovascularization occurs when tumors grow larger than about 1 mm3, as they can no longer acquire sufficient nutrients from the surrounding vasculature. Such tumors require their own vascular network to supply oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products. Because of their rapid growth and development, these vessels feature irregular branching and diameter, poor wall structure, abnormal bulges, and blind ends. This immature vasculature provides an attractive target for cancer therapy. Therapeutic agents that target tumor vasculature are referred to as vascular targeting agents (VTAs), which can be divided into the angiogenesis inhibiting agents (AIAs) and vascular disrupting agents (VDAs). AIAs inhibit the growth of new vasculature to the tumor, while VDAs damage already sprouted vessels. VDAs are sub-divided into biological agents and small-molecule therapeutics, and treatment with either of these entities leads to tumor necrosis. FIG. 3 shows several clinically relevant VDAs including CA4P, CA1P, BNC105, AVE8062, ZD6126, and Plinabulin (BeyondSpring Pharmaceuticals, New York, N.Y.).
Colchicine, a natural product originally isolated from the autumn crocus, Colchicum autumnale, and the namesake for the colchicine site on tubulin, is a potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization, but colchicine has a narrow therapeutic window limiting its development as an anticancer agent. Another natural product binding to the colchicine site on tubulin is CA4 (shown in FIG. 1). Originally isolated from the African bushwillow tree, Combretum caffrum, and synthesized by Pettit and co-workers, CA4 binds tightly to the colchicine site on tubulin and functions as a VDA. Combretastatin A-4P [(CA4P), FIG. 3] was synthesized as a water-soluble prodrug salt for therapeutic use.
SUMMARY
The present disclosure pertains to anticancer agents that function as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization.
In particular, the present disclosure pertains to a variety of fused aryl-cycloalkyl and aryl-heterocyclic compounds that function as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization. The compounds are useful as anticancer agents in a new therapeutic approach for cancer treatment utilizing small-molecule inhibitors of tubulin polymerization that also act as vascular disrupting agents (VDAs).
Prominent among these compounds is a benzosuberene analogue (referred to herein as KPG18), which demonstrates potent cytotoxicity (sub-nM) against human cancer cell lines and functions (as its corresponding water-soluble prodrug salt) as a VDA in mouse models. Structure activity relationship considerations led to the evaluation of benzocyclooctyl [6,8 fused] and indene [6,5 fused] ring systems. Four benzocyclooctene and four indene analogues were prepared and evaluated biologically. Three of the benzocyclooctene analogues were active as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization (IC50<5 μM), and benzocyclooctene phenol 23 was comparable to KGP18 in terms of potency. The analogous indene-based compound 31 also functioned as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization (IC50=11 μM) with reduced potency. The most potent inhibitor of tubulin polymerization from this group was benzocyclooctene analogue 23, and it was converted to its water-soluble prodrug salt 24 to assess its potential as a VDA. Preliminary in vivo studies, which utilized the MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry breast tumor in a SCID mouse model, demonstrated that treatment with 24 (120 mg/kg) resulted in significant vascular shutdown, as evidenced by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) at 4 h post administration, and that the effect continued at both 24 and 48 h. Contemporaneous studies with CA4P, a clinically relevant VDA, were carried out as a positive control.
Accordingly, the present disclosure pertains to benzocyclooctene (fused 6,8 ring system) analogues and corresponding indene (fused 6,5 ring system) analogues.

EXAMPLES
General Synthesis
Four benzocyclooctene analogues and four indene analogues were synthesized. These analogues were prepared utilizing a synthetic strategy reminiscent of that employed for a variety of benzosuberene analogues (Tanpure et al., 2012; Herdman et al., 2015). The synthesis of each benzocyclooctene analogue was initiated with a Wittig olefination followed by catalytic hydrogenation to afford carboxylic acids 3 and 4, as shown in Scheme 1 in FIG. 5. A Friedel-Crafts intramolecular annulation was accomplished using Eaton's reagent (7.7 weight percent P2O5 in CH3SO3H) (Eaton et al., 1973), and the reaction was diluted and cooled in order to facilitate the construction of benzocyclooctones 5 and 6. Without dilution and cooling, the desired product was not formed and only starting material remained.
A similar catalytic reduction was utilized with starting material trans-2,3-dimethoxycinnamic acid to afford carboxylic acids 9 and 10, which were cyclized with Eaton's reagent to their corresponding indanone analogues 11 and 12, shown in Scheme 2 in FIG. 6. Benzocyclooctene 5 and indene 11 bearing the ortho dimethoxy motif were each subjected to a selective demethylation (Tanpure et al., 2013; Herdman et al., 2015; Kemperman, et al. 2003) to afford phenolic analogues 13 and 15, which were subsequently protected with TBS to yield 14 and 16, as shown in Scheme 3 in FIG. 7.
Trimethoxyphenyllithium (prepared from the corresponding aryl bromide) underwent a 1,2-addition reaction to benzocyclooctanone analogues 5, 6 and 14 to afford the corresponding tertiary alcohols 17, 18, and 19. Subsequent dehydration afforded benzocyclooctene analogues 20 and 21 and TBS-protected analogue 22, which underwent deprotection to afford phenolic benzocyclooctene 23, shown in Scheme 4 in FIG. 8.
Phenolic analogue 23 was converted to its corresponding phosphate prodrug salt 24, in order to increase water solubility for in vivo studies, as shown in Scheme 5 in FIG. 9. Analogous aryl addition reactions were carried out on indanone intermediates 11, 12, and 16 to generate the corresponding tertiary alcohols 25, 26, and 27, as shown in Scheme 6 in FIG. 10. Subsequent dehydration afforded indene analogues 28 29, and 30. Removal of the TBS group afforded phenolic indene 31. The indene phenol 31 was also converted to its corresponding phosphate salt 32, as shown in Scheme 7 in FIG. 11. While TEA proved to be an acceptable base (due to ease of removal) for use in the synthesis of the eight membered ring phosphate salt 24, in the synthesis of the indene phosphate salt 32 TEA proved to be hard to remove during purification. Altering the base to pyridine solved this problem and allowed the water-soluble phosphate salt 32 to be synthesized in high purity.
Due to their increased size, eight membered rings are the first in the homologous series (3, 4, 5, 6, 7-membered rings) that can accommodate both Z and E double bond configurations. However, only the Z configurations were synthesized. X-ray crystal structures were obtained for benzocyclooctene analogues 20 and 23 to confirm their Z double bond configuration. FIG. 4 shows the structures of synthesized benzocyclooctene analogues 20, 21, 23, and 24 and indene analogues 28, 29, 31, and 32.
Biological Evaluation
The four target benzocyclooctene and four indene analogues were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines and for their abilities to inhibit tubulin polymerization and colchicine binding to tubulin.
SRB Assay (Monks et al., 1991; Vichai et al., 2006)
Inhibition of growth of human cancer cells was assessed using the sulforhodamine B assay (SRB), as described in Monks et al., 1991. Cancer cell lines (DU-145, SK-OV-3, and NCI-H460) were plated at 7500-8000 cells/well into 96-well plates using DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum/1% gentamicin sulfate and incubated for 24 h at 37° C. in a humidified incubator. Compound serial dilutions were then added. After 48 h treatment, the cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), washed, dried, stained with sulforhodamine B dye (Acid red 52), washed to remove excess dye, and dried. SRB dye was solubilized, and absorbances were measured at wavelength 540 nm and normalized to values at wavelength 630 nm using an automated Biotek plate reader. A growth inhibition of 50% (GI50 or the drug concentration causing 50% reduction in the net protein increase) was calculated from the absorbance data. Results are shown in Table 1 below.
Colchicine Binding Assay
Inhibition of [3H] colchicine binding to tubulin was measured using reaction mixtures (100 μL, each) containing 1.0 μM tubulin, 5.0 μM [3H] colchicine (from Perkin-Elmer), 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, potential inhibitors at 5.0 μM, and components that stabilize the colchicine binding activity of tubulin (Hamel et al., 1981) (1.0 M monosodium glutamate [adjusted to pH 6.6 with HCl in a 2.0 M stock solution], 0.5 mg/mL bovine serum albumin, 0.1 M glucose-1-phosphate, 1.0 mM MgCl2, and 1.0 mM GTP). Incubation was for 10 min at 37° C., a time point selected because the binding reaction in control reaction mixtures is 40-60% complete. Reactions were stopped with 2.0 mL of ice-cold water, and the reaction mixtures were placed on ice. Each sample was poured onto a stack of two DEAE-cellulose filters (from Whatman), followed by 6 mL of ice-cold water. The samples were aspirated under reduced vacuum. The filters were washed three times with 2 mL water and placed into vials containing 5 mL of Biosafe II scintillation cocktail. Samples were counted 18 h later in a Beckman scintillation counter. Samples with inhibitors were compared to samples with no inhibitor, and percent inhibition was determined. All samples were corrected for the amount of radiolabel bound to the filters in the absence of tubulin. Results are shown in Table 1 below.
Inhibition of Tubulin Polymerization
Tubulin assembly experiments were performed in 0.25 mL reaction mixtures (final volume) (Hamel, 2003). The mixtures contained 1 mg/mL (10 μM) purified bovine brain tubulin, 0.8 M monosodium glutamate (pH 6.6), 4% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.4 mM GTP, and different compound concentrations. All reaction components except GTP were preincubated for 15 min at 30° C. in 0.24 mL. The mixtures were cooled to 0° C., and 10 μL of 10 mM GTP were added. Reaction mixtures were transferred to cuvettes held at 0° C. in Beckman DU-7400 and DU-7500 spectrophotometers equipped with electronic temperature controllers. The temperature was jumped to 30° C., taking about 30 s, and polymerization was followed at 350 nm for 20 min. The IC50 was defined as the compound concentration that inhibited extent of assembly by 50% after 20 min. Results are shown in Table 1 below. Table 1 shows inhibition of tubulin polymerization [(expressed as half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)] and cytotoxicity [expressed as growth inhibition of 50% (GI50)] of the eight target analogues synthesized.

Among the seven compounds synthesized and analyzed biologically, only the target benzocyclooctene analogues (20, 21, and 23) had activities as inhibitors of tubulin polymerization similar to those of CA4 and KGP18. Benzocyclooctene phenol 23 demonstrated the lowest IC50 value (1.2 μM) among the compounds evaluated in this study. A binding study utilizing radiolabeled colchicine demonstrated that at a concentration 5 μM, phenol 23 inhibited colchicine binding by 78%, a twenty percent improvement when compared to CA4 (used as a positive control) in this assay. Considering the three indene analogues, only phenolic indene 31 demonstrated modest inhibition of tubulin polymerization, with an IC50 value of 11 μM.
Benzocyclooctene phenol 23 and its corresponding phosphate prodrug salt 24 were the most cytotoxic analogues in these series against the three human cancer cell lines examined (for example, GI50=0.105 and 0.0410 μM against DU-145 (prostate) for analogues 23 and 24, respectively). While structurally similar to KGP18, differing by the addition of one carbon to the aliphatic ring, the phenolic benzocyclooctene analogue is dramatically less cytotoxic than its benzosuberene counterpart. Compound 23 and 24 had GI50 values in the submicromolar range, while the values obtained with KGP18 were all subnanomolar.
In Vivo Studies
Human breast cancer cells, MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry (ATCC), were transfected sequentially with a lentivirus containing firefly luciferase reporter, GFP and mCherry reporter genes, as described in Liu et al., 2012. Highly expressing stable clones were isolated. Induction of tumors was carried out by injecting 106 cells mixed with 50% Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.) into the right upper ventral mammary fat pads of female SCID-NOD mice (UTSW breeding colony). Tumors were allowed to grow to a size of 10-12 mm in diameter, determined by calipers, before selection for BLI. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Bioluminescence imaging was carried out as described in Liu et al., 2012. Briefly, anesthetized, tumor bearing mice (O2, 2% isoflurane, Henry Schein Inc., Melville, N.Y.) were injected subcutaneously in the fore-back neck region with 80 μL of a solution of luciferase substrate, D-luciferin (sodium salt, 120 mg/kg, in saline, Gold Biotechnology, St. Louis, Mo.). Mice were maintained under anesthesia (2% isoflurane in oxygen, 1 dm3/min), while baseline bioluminescence imaging was performed using a Caliper Xenogen IVIS® Spectrum (Perkin-Elmer, Alameda, Calif.). A series of BLI images was collected over 35 min using the following settings: auto exposure time, f-stop=2, Field of view=D, binning=4 (medium). Light intensity-time curves obtained from these images were analyzed using Living Image® software and light emission compared based on area under the light emission curve. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with either 120 μL of saline (vehicle), CA4P (provided by Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.; 120 mg/kg in saline as used in Mason et al., 2011 or analogue 24 (120 mg/kg) in saline immediately after baseline BLI. Bioluminescence imaging was repeated, with new luciferin injections 4, 24, and 48 h later.
Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a highly valuable modality with diverse applications in a wide range of biological models and systems. BLI is a particularly useful tool for assessing and quantifying in vivo blood flow reduction following treatment with a VDA. In the current study MCF7 human breast cancer cells, which had been previously transfected stably to express the enzyme luciferase, as well as two fluorescent proteins, as designated by MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry were implanted in in SCID mice. Since the luciferase substrate luciferin can be delivered to the tumor via the blood stream, damage to the vessels by a VDA can be quantified by measurement of reduced bioluminescence upon injection of luciferin.
Three mice bearing the MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry breast tumor were injected ip with analogue 24 (120 m/kg) with BLI assessment performed at baseline (0 h, pre-administration) and at 4 h, 24 h, and 48 h after administration of 24. In a contemporaneous study, one mouse was treated with CA4P (120 mg/kg) as a positive control and a separate mouse was treated with saline alone. A limited dose escalation study with analogue 24 in non-tumor bearing SCID mice (60-150 mg/kg, unpublished data) suggested that a dose of 120 mg/kg was tolerated and likely below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), which has not yet been determined. The optimal CA4P dose in SCID mice for evaluation of VDA efficacy has been previously established at 120 mg/kg (Zhao et al., 2008). FIG. 12 shows dynamic bioluminescence with respect to vascular disruption. In FIG. 12A, graphs show evolution of light emission from individual MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry breast tumors following administration of luciferin substrate subcutaneously in the fore-back region of each mouse at time 0. Respective curves are baseline, 4 h, 24 h and 48 h post administration of VDA. Left hand panel shows representative mouse with 120 mg/kg analogue 24 and right hand panel shows CA4P (120 mg/kg). FIG. 12B shows photographs of selected images at the 10 min. time point. Left hand group for analogue 24 and right hand group for CA4P for the same mice used to generate the curves for part A. Respective images are each scaled to same values.
Single dose treatment with both analogue 24 and CA4P resulted in a significant reduction in bioluminescence (approximately 80% decrease compared to baseline or saline control; p<0.05) at 4 h after compound injection. While bioluminescence intensity in the mouse treated with compound 24 recovered somewhat at 24 and 48 h, it remained significantly below baseline values (p<0.005). In this study, the BLI data for both analogue 24 and CA4P at 4 h were statistically different from the saline control, but not from each other or from the data obtained at other time points.
Following the 48 h BLI data acquisition, the tumors were excised, bisected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Tumor tissue was processed for paraffin embedding, sectioned and stained by routine methods. H&E staining was performed on one cross section from each tumor. Whole mount high resolution microscopy was obtained using a Zeiss Axioscan Z1 digital slide scanner. FIG. 13 shows histological assessment of tumor necrosis, with H&E stained tumor cross sections showing necrotic and viable regions at 48 h post treatment for (A) Analogue 24 (120 mg/kg), (B) CA4P (120 mg/kg), and (C) Saline. Routine staining using H&E indicated much more extensive necrosis throughout the tumors following administration of 24 or CA4P each at 120 mg/kg, as compared with saline control. Thus, analogue 24 may be a therapeutically useful VDA.
These studies, which focused on indene and benzocyclooctene ring systems, expanded the known SAR associated with the effect that fused aliphatic ring size plays in regard to cytotoxicity and inhibition of tubulin polymerization. From the group of eight analogues prepared by chemical synthesis with seven compounds evaluated biologically, three benzocyclooctene analogues were strong inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and one indene analogue was a modest inhibitor. The most promising compound (benzocyclooctene analogue 23) was prepared and evaluated as its corresponding water-soluble phosphate salt 24. It demonstrated significant in vivo reduction of blood flow (as evidenced by BLI) in an MCF7-luc-GFP-mCherry tumor model in SCID mice, and the results indicated that 24 appears promising as a VDA for potential cancer treatment.
Synthesis and Data
Tetrahydrofuran (THF), CH2Cl2, ethanol, methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), and acetonitrile were used in their anhydrous forms. Reactions were performed under nitrogen gas. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (precoated glass plates with silica gel 60 F254, 0.25 mm thickness) were used to monitor reactions. Purification of intermediates and products was carried out with a Biotage Isolera flash purification system using silica gel (200-400 mesh, 60 Å). Intermediates and products synthesized were characterized on the basis of their 1H NMR (500 or 600 MHz) and 13C NMR (125 or 150 MHz) spectroscopic data using a Varian VNMRS 500 MHz or a Bruker Ascend 600 MHz instrument. Spectra were recorded in CDCl3 and D2O. All chemical shifts are expressed in ppm (δ), coupling constants (J) are presented in Hz, and peak patterns are reported as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), pentet (p), septet (sept), and multiplet (m).
