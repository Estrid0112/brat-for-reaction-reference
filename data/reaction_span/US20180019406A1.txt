CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0090775, filed on Jul. 18, 2016, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and entitled: “Heterocyclic Compound and Organic Light-Emitting Device Including the Same,” is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
Embodiments relate to a compound for an organic light-emitting device and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Compared to devices in the art, organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices, have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, and excellent brightness, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics, and produce full-color images.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transition from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.
SUMMARY

Example 1
An anode was prepared by cutting an ITO glass substrate (manufactured by Corning), on which an ITO layer was deposited to a thickness of 15 Ω/cm2 (1,200 Å), to a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm, ultrasonically cleaning the ITO glass substrate (anode) using isopropyl alcohol and pure water each for 5 minutes, and then, exposing the ITO glass substrate (anode) to UV irradiation for 30 minutes and ozone to clean the ITO glass substrate. Then, the ITO glass substrate (anode) was loaded into a vacuum deposition apparatus.
2-TNATA was vacuum-deposited on the ITO glass substrate (anode) to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 600 Å, and NPB was vacuum-deposited on the hole injection layer to form a hole transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, thereby forming a hole transport region.
AND (host) and DPAVBi (dopant) were co-deposited on the hole transport layer at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
Then, Compound 1 was deposited on the emission layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, LiF was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å, and A1 was vacuum-deposited on the electron injection layer to form a cathode having a thickness of 3,000 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
