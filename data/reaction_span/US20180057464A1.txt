BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Olaparib (AZD-2281, trade name Lynparza) is an FDA-approved targeted therapy for cancer, developed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals and later by AstraZeneca. Lynparza is approved in the form of 50 mg capsules. It is a PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. In December 2014, Olaparib was approved for use as a single agent by the EMA and the FDA. The FDA approval is in for germline BRCA mutated (gBRCAm) advanced ovarian cancer that has received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy. The prescribing information instructs physicians to “select patients for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with Lynparza based on the presence of deleterious or suspected deleterious germline BRCA-mutations.”
AstraZeneca recently announced that FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for the oral poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Lynparza™ (olaparib), for the monotherapy treatment of BRCA1/2 or ATM gene mutated metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) in patients who have received a prior taxane-based chemotherapy and at least one newer hormonal agent (abiraterone or enzalutamide).
Given the great usefulness of this compound, a need in the art exists to effectively and efficiently synthesize olaparib.
A key intermediate in the process of preparing olaparib is 2-fluoro-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-yl)methyl)-benzoic acid (compound D). Two synthetic approaches of olaparib are the main design developed by this company and they are disclosed or claimed in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,449,464, 7,692,006 and 8,247,416. Scheme 1, below, illustrates the synthetic schemes describes in these patents.

The '006 approach involves contacting compound D with 1-Boc-piperazine in dimethylacetamine (DMA) in the presence of HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) to provide 4-[2-fluoro-5-(4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-ylmethyl)-benzoyl]-piperazin-1-carboxylic acid tert-butyl ester (compound C), followed by adding concentrated HCl to remove tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) group and obtaining 4-[4-fluoro-3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (compound B), and then compound B couples with cyclopropane carbonyl chloride to afford crude 4-[3-(4-cyclocarbonyl-piperazine-1-carbonyl)-4-fluoro-benzyl]-2H-phthalazin-1-one (i.e., crude olaparib).
The '416 approach is related to a direct coupling reaction of compound D with 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine (compound I) or 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine HCl salt (compound I') in the presence of HBTU to obtain crude olaparib (Scheme 1).
According to the above-mentioned '006 approach, treatment of compound D with 1-Boc-piperazine in dimethylacetamide (DMA) in the presence of an expensive (and difficult to dissolve) amide coupling reagent 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) resulted in the formation of compound C with only a 78% yield.See, Scheme 2.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00002.TIF </img>
In the next step of the '006 approach, compound C underwent de-Boc reaction under acidic conditions (concentrated HCl(aq) in MeOH) to afford compound B with a yield of only 58.50/% yield. See, Scheme 3.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00003.TIF </img>
Subsequently, a pre-mixed solution of triethylamine (Et3N) and cyclopropane carbonyl chloride in dichloromethane was added dropwise to a stirred solution of compound B in dichloromethane. Upon completion, the reaction mixture was extracted with 5% citric acid(aq), 5% Na2CO3(aq), and water, followed by distilling dichloromethane and replacing the distillate with ethanol. The resulting mixture was filtered and the solid was recrystallized in water to afford olaparib in 90% yield. See, Scheme 4. However, this reaction includes the use of toxic chemicals such as dichloromethane and requires distilling the solvent in the work up steps.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00004.TIF </img>
According to the '416 approach, treatment of compound D with 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine or its mineral acid salt in the presence of an amide coupling reagent 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and a base in acetonitrile led to the formation of olaparib directly. See, Scheme 5. However, the process described in the '416 patent only affords olaparib in 84% or 62% yields after recrystallization. Moreover, this reaction includes the use of an expensive (and difficult to dissolve) coupling agent (HBTU) as well as a toxic and highly flammable solvent in acetonitrile.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00005.TIF </img>
In view of the foregoing, the need exists for an improved process to produce olaparib with commercially acceptable yields, increased efficiency, and less toxic chemicals.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
I. General
The present invention provides improved processes for the preparation of 4-[(3-[(4-cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]carbonyl)-4-fluorophenyl]methyl(2H)phthalazin-1-one (Olaparib) and intermediates thereof. Olaparib is a poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, and is useful in the treatment of cancer. Olaparib can be particularly useful as a cancer treatment in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers.
More specifically, the present disclosure provides two improved chemical process for the preparation of olaparib and intermediates thereof. Each route involves the use of the compound 2-fluoro-5-((4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-phthalazin-1-yl)methyl)-benzoic acid (compound D) as a starting material in the preparation of olaparib. Each step in both disclosed processes provides advancements over known methods such as improved yields, improved purities, use of less toxic reagents and solvents, and/or provides more efficient isolation of relatively high purity olaparib. Accordingly, the present invention is time-saving, more environmentally friendly, and suitable for industrial manufacturing.

<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00019.TIF </img>
A. Route B
In accordance with Route B of the present disclosure, the synthesis of olaparib can be performed by(a) contacting 5-[(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)methyl]-2-fluorobenzoic acid (compound D):
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00020.TIF </img>with 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine, pivaloyl chloride, and a tertiary amine in a first organic solvent to provide compound C
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00021.TIF </img>(b) contacting compound C and a suitable acid to provide compound L
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00022.TIF </img>
wherein X is an anion; and(c) contacting compound L with cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride, an inorganic base in a biphasic reaction system comprising water and a second organic solvent to afford olaparib.
As noted in the general description section above, a person of skill in the art will appreciate that selected steps in the process may be conducted independent of the origin of starting material or intermediates. Accordingly, steps (a), (b), and/or (c) may be carried out independently while remaining within the scope of the present disclosure.
Step (a) of Route B forms an amide bond using pivaloyl chloride as a coupling reagent in a reaction mixture with a tertiary amine, and a first organic solvent to afford compound C. See, Scheme 8. The embodiments of step (a) described herein not only improve the yield of this conversion, but also use a cheaper coupling reagent making the process more industrially applicable.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00023.TIF </img>
A particular order of addition of compounds and solvents is not required in successfully converting compound D to compound C. Typically, one would admix compound D dissolved in an organic solvent with DIPEA and pivaloyl chloride. After a suitable amount of time, 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine is added to this reaction mixture. In some embodiments, all reagents and solvents are added simultaneously.
The conversion of compound D to compound C according to step (a) of Route B can be carried out at a variety of temperatures. For example, the reaction can be performed at from about 5 to 100° C., from about 10 to 60° C., from about 15 to 40° C., or from about 20 to 30° C. In some embodiments, the addition of DIPEA is performed at a temperature of not more than 30° C.
A person of skill in the art will recognize the time to complete the reaction will depend on temperature.
In some embodiments, the tertiary amine used in step (a) of Route B is selected from the group consisting of trimethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), tributylamine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP), pempidine (PMP), 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine. In some embodiments, the tertiary amine used in step (a) is N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA).
In some embodiments, the first organic solvent used in step (a) of Route B is a dialkyl ketone. In some embodiments, the dialkyl ketone is selected from the group consisting of acetone, acetophenone, butanone, diethyl ketone, ethyl isopropyl ketone, 2-hexanone, isophorone, mesityl oxide, methyl isobutyl ketone, methylisopropyl ketone, 3-methyl-2-pentanone, 2-pentanone, cyclohexanone, and cyclopetanone. In some embodiments the dialkyl ketone is acetone.
In some embodiments, the yield of step (a) in Route B is greater than 80, 85, 90, 92, 95, or 96%. In some embodiments, the yield is greater than or equal to 97%.
Step (b) of Route B is a de-boc reaction that is performed with an acid. See, Scheme 9.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00024.TIF </img>
In some embodiments, the suitable acid used in step (b) is p-toluenesulfonic acid. In some embodiments, the anion (X) is tosylate.
A person or ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the order of addition of compounds and solvents is not required in successfully converting compound C to compound L.
Typically, one would admix compound C with an acid, a first organic solvent and water.
The conversion of compound C to compound L according to step (b) of Route B can be carried out at a variety of temperatures. For example, the reaction can be performed at from about 10 to 100° C., from about 30 to 90° C., from about 50 to 80° C., or from about 60 to 70° C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the reaction is about 65° C. A person of skill in the art will recognize the time to complete the reaction will depend on temperature.
The embodiments of step (b) of Route B described herein greatly improve the yield of this conversion. In some embodiments, the yield of step (b) is greater than 70, 80, 85, or 90%.
In some embodiments, the yield is greater than or equal to 91%. In contrast, the '006 approach as shown in Scheme 3 produces the free base form of compound B with only a 58.5% yield.
Step (c) of Route B provides a biphasic solvent system comprising water and a second organic solvent which can efficiently convert compound L or a free base thereof to olaparib in a very high yield and purity. In some embodiments, the conversion of step (c) is performed with a second organic solvent, an inorganic base, and cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride. Scheme 10 shows the production of olaparib starting from compound J (a particular compound within the scope of compound L) according to step (c) of Route B. Scheme 10 is shown as an illustrative example of this conversion, and it not meant to limit the scope of the invention in any way.
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00025.TIF </img>
A person or ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the order of addition of compounds and solvents is not required in successfully converting compound L or a free base thereof to olaparib. Typically, one would admix a second organic solvent and water followed by addition compound L or its free base and an inorganic base. After a sufficient amount of time, cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride is added to the reaction mixture. In some embodiments, all compounds and solvents are added at the same time.
The conversion of compound L or a free base thereof to olaparib can be carried out at a variety of temperatures. For example, the reaction can be performed at from about 10 to 100° C., from about 15 to 80° C., from about 17 to 60° C., or from about 20 to 40° C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the reaction is about 25° C. A person of skill in the art will recognize the time to complete the reaction will depend on temperature.
In some embodiments, the olaparib produced via step (c) of Route B has a decreased solubility in the reaction solvent as compared to the starting material. In some embodiments, the reaction is cooled to a lower temperature to facilitate the precipitation of olaparib from the reaction solvent. A lower reaction temperature can include any temperature below 20° C. For example, a lower reaction temperature can include temperatures below 15° C., 10° C., 5° C., 0° C., or −10° C. In some embodiments, the lower reaction temperature is about 0° C.
The conversion of step (c) of Route B can be achieved using a variety of inorganic bases. In some embodiments, the inorganic base used in step (c) is selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal carbonate, an alkali metal bicarbonate, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the alkali metal carbonate is selected from the group consisting of Li2CO3, Na2CO3, K2CO3, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the alkali metal carbonate is K2CO3. In some embodiments, the alkali metal bicarbonate is selected from the group consisting of LiHCO3 and NaHCO3.
In some embodiments, the second organic solvent used in step (c) of Route B is a C1-10alkyl acetate. In some embodiments, the C1-10alkyl acetate is ethyl acetate.
Unlike the method according to the '006 patent, the method according to step (c) of Route B does not require an additional distillation step to remove any solvent in work-up steps. See, Scheme 4. Instead, the products of step (c) (olaparib) precipitate in the biphasic solvent system. This greatly reduces work-up and isolation efforts, greatly improving its industrial applicability. In some embodiments, after the addition of cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride in the two-phase solvent system, a considerable amount of precipitates was observed in few minutes.
The process according to step (c) of Route B can produce high yields and highly pure olaparib. In some embodiments, the yield of step (c) of Route B can be greater than 85, 90, or 95%. In some embodiments, the purity of olaparib obtained in step (c) can be greater than 90, 95, 97, or 99% pure.
In some embodiments, the synthesis of compound L in Route B could be simplified to a single one-pot process, where steps (a) and (b) are performed in a single reaction vessel. The process according to these embodiments removes the need to isolate compound C. Rather than isolating compound C, step (a) and (b) can be merged by the addition of a suitable acid according to step (b) into the reaction mixture of step (a). In some embodiments, the suitable acid is p-toluenesulfonic acid. In some embodiments water is added with the suitable acid.
In some embodiments, the one-pot process of Route B is heated when a suitable acid is added. In some embodiments, the one-pot process is cooled after a suitable amount of time to complete both reactions. A suitable amount of time can be 1, 2, 3, 4 or more hours.
In some embodiments, compound L precipitates from the reaction when the one-pot process is cooled after the reaction is complete. Precipitation of compound L greatly improves the industrial applicability and efficiency of this process.
In one embodiment, while the reaction of compound D with 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperazine was completed in a reaction mixture with pivaloyl chloride and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), in acetone, p-TSA and water were directly added to the reactor and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux. Subsequently, the reaction was cooled to about 0° C., as a result, the precipitation of compound J was observed. After filtering and washing with acetone, the obtained compound J could be employed to prepare olaparib without any loss of quality.
B. Route A
In accordance with Route A of the present disclosure, the synthesis of olaparib can be performed bycontacting the 5-[(3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-1-phthalazinyl)methyl]-2-fluorobenzoic acid (compound D):
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00026.TIF </img>with N-cyclopropanoyl piperazinium p-toluenesulfonate (compound A)
<img> id-US20180057464A1-20180301-C00027.TIF </img>pivaloyl chloride, and a tertiary amine in an organic solvent to afford olaparib.
A person or ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the order of addition of compounds and solvents is not required in successfully converting compound D to olaparib. Typically, one would admix compound D dissolved in an organic solvent with DIPEA and pivaloyl chloride. After a suitable amount of time, compound A is added to this reaction mixture.
The process of Route A can be carried out at a variety of temperatures. For example, the temperature of the reaction mixture when adding compounds and/or solvents can be about 0° C. and after addition of the compounds/solvents the reaction mixture can be about 24° C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the reaction mixture when adding compounds and/or solvents is from about −40 to 20° C. In some embodiments, the temperature when adding compounds and/or solvents is from about −10 to 10° C. In some embodiments, the temperature after adding compounds and/or solvents is from about 10 to 50° C. In some embodiments, the temperature after adding compounds and/or solvents is from about 20 to 30° C.
In accordance with Route A of the present disclosure, p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TSA) was preferably used as acid source to prepare compound A through a de-Boc reaction of tert-butyl 4-(cyclopropanecarbonyl)piperazine-1-carboxylate. Applicants have surprisingly discovered that, compound A is non-hygroscopic and well-crystallized in comparison with 1-(cyclopropylcarbonyl)piperazine and its mineral acid salt. It has been found that these properties are surprisingly more beneficial for the treatment and storage of compound A in the course of manufacturing olaparib.
HBTU, the coupling agent used in '416 patent, requires a high polar solvent such as acetonitrile to dissolve. In contrast, the process according to Route A uses pivaloyl chloride as a coupling agent. Pivaloyl chloride is much more soluble and can be used in various organic solvents. By switching the coupling agent, the process for producing olaparib disclosed herein removes both the expensive coupling agent, HBTU, as well as the toxic and highly flammable solvent, acetonitrile.
In some embodiments, the organic solvent used in Rout A is a dialkyl ketone. In some embodiments, the dialkyl ketone is selected from the group consisting of acetone, acetophenone, butanone, diethyl ketone, ethyl isopropyl ketone, 2-hexanone, isophorone, mesityl oxide, methyl isobutyl ketone, methylisopropyl ketone, 3-methyl-2-pentanone, 2-pentanone, cyclohexanone, and cyclopetanone. In some embodiments, the dialkyl ketone is acetone.
In some embodiments, the tertiary amine used in Route A is selected from the group consisting of trimethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), N-methylmorpholine (NMM), tributylamine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP), pempidine (PMP), 2,6-dimethylpyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine. In some embodiments, the tertiary amine is N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA).
In some embodiments, Route A further comprises isolating olaparib. The isolation of olaparib can be performed using various known means in the art. For example, olaparib may be isolated using liquid-liquid extraction. In some embodiments olaparib is isolated by extracting the reaction mixture with an aqueous solvent. In some embodiments the aqueous solvent comprises water, a base, and a salt. In some embodiments the base is NaHCO3 and the salt is NaCl. In some embodiments, the extraction further comprises addition of an organic solvent. In some embodiments the organic solvent is EtOAc.
In some embodiments Route A comprises recrystallizing isolated olaparib. In some embodiments, isolated olaparib is dissolved in a solvent and warmed to an elevated temperature followed by addition of an antisolvent to precipitate olaparib. In some embodiments the solvent is MeOH. In some embodiments, the antisolvent is water. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature is from about 40 to 80° C. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature is 60-70° C. In some embodiments, the elevated temperature is about 65° C. In some embodiments, the solution of solvent and antisolvent is cooled to room temperature facilitate precipitation.
In some embodiments, the yield of recrystallized olaparib produced using Route A is greater than 70%. In some embodiments, the yield of Route A is greater than 75, 80, or 85%. In some embodiments the purity of recrystallized olaparib produced by Route A is greater than 90, 95, 97, or 99%.
An additional advantage to the process of Route A is that pivaloyl chloride can be rapidly quenched with water in work-up steps to generate pivalic acid, which is mild irritant and much less toxic against the human body and the environment. Accordingly, Route A is an improved process for preparing olaparib in comparison with the synthetic routes currently known.
