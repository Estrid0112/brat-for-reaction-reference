TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a method for producing a quaternary phosphonium compound labeled with a radionuclide, in particular a positron emitting nuclide such as 18F. This invention also relates to a quaternary phosphonium compound labeled with a radionuclide, in particular a positron emitting nuclide such as 18F, and to an imaging agent comprising said compound.
BACKGROUND ART
There is formed a proton concentration gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and due to the concentration gradient, a membrane potential from −140 mV to −180 mV is generated in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Delocalized lipophilic cations (DLCs) are molecules having a structure that permits intramolecular delocalization of positive charge by resonance stabilization. DLCs have sufficient lipophilicity to easily pass through the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane, and have the characteristic of accumulating in mitochondria of living organisms utilizing a mitochondrial membrane electrochemical potential (Non-Patent Literatures 1 and 2).
Research has been made on the usage of radionuclide-labeled DLCs in various applications including myocardial perfusion imaging, apoptosis imaging, and imaging of brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity. In particular, there have been many reports concerning myocardial perfusion imaging.
At present, ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in the world. According to the survey made by the World Health Organization, seven million people died of this disease in 2011. In Japan, this disease ranks the second leading cause of death behind malignant neoplasm. Ischemic heart disease is a generic name for angina pectoris, heart infarction, and the like, and is mainly caused by the progression of arteriosclerosis of the coronary artery. For the purpose of effective treatment, early detection of myocardial ischemia is essential. Therefore, the development of a highly accurate diagnostic method which leads to early detection of ischemic heart disease may well be said to be one of the important challenges in modern medicine.
Examples of common detection methods for ischemic heart disease include not only electrocardiographic examination, ultrasonographic examination, blood examination, and cardiac catheter examination, but also myocardial perfusion imaging using a nuclear medicine examination method such as PET or SPECT. In patients with mild myocardial ischemia, the blood flow over the whole myocardium is maintained during rest, but when a stress is imposed on the myocardium due to exercise, etc., the myocardium requires large amounts of oxygen and nutrients and thus circulatory blood flow increases. While the blood flow increases in normal sites, coronary blood flow does not increase in arterioles distal to the site of narrowing, since blood vessels are dilated almost to the maximum during rest to maintain the blood flow. Thus, when imaging is performed under myocardial stress, the site of narrowing appears as an image of loss of radioactivity. Based on this principle, diagnosis of myocardial blood flow is done by imposing a stress on the myocardium of patients through exercise or the use of a medication like adenosine and comparing images taken during rest and stress.
In clinical settings, SPECT agents-e.g [201Tl]TlCl, and 99mTc-labeled formulations like [99mTc]sestamibi (MIBI) and [99mTc]tetrofosmin-are now mainly used as myocardial perfusion imaging agents. However, SPECT has some limitations: for example, since there is no standardized radiation attenuation correction method available, the influence of radiation attenuation occurs in stout patients or large-breasted female patients; and also this method is unfit for quantitative analysis. So, there is an expectation to use a PET method characterized by high spatial resolution and sensitivity.
Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death induced by the activation of a specific protease (caspase) present in cells. It is reported that the activation of caspase is mediated by cytochrome c released from mitochondria, and that the release of cytochrome c takes place in association with change in mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondria play an important role in the control of apoptosis (Non-Patent Literature 3).
Unlike white adipose responsible for energy storage, brown adipose tissue produces heat through energy consumption, and thus is one of the targets for the treatment of obesity. Brown adipose produces heat for body-temperature maintenance in cold environments or through consumption of high fat foods, and this heat production takes place in mitochondria abundant in brown adipose cells.
PET agents reported include [15O]H2O, [13N]NH3, and [82Rb]RbCl. However, since 15O abd 13N have a short half-life of 2 and 10 minutes, respectively, the use of [15O]H2O and [13N]NH3 is limited to clinical facilities equipped with a cyclotron. Further, 82Rb is produced from 82Sr in a generator, but since the generator is expensive, there is a limitation on the use of the generator for high-throughput applications. For these reasons, active research and development have in recent years been conducted on 18F-labeled PET imaging agents having a longer half-life (110 minutes) than the aforementioned nuclides (Patent Literatures 1 to 3, and Non-Patent Literatures 5 to 11).

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
In 2004, Ravert, et al. reported the synthesis of 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl-triphenylphosphonium bromide ([18F]FBnTP) (Non-Patent Literature 5). Such phosphonium compounds having three phenyl groups have characteristics as delocalized lipophilic cations (DLCs) which permit intramolecular delocalization of positive charge by resonance stabilization. Due to their lipophilicity, DLCs are capable of easily passing through the lipid bilayer of a cell membrane and preferentially accumulating in the inner mitochondrial membrane which has a very low membrane potential. There are reports on myocardial perfusion imaging performed with [18F]FBnTP, targeting mitochondria abundant in myocardial cells (Non-Patent Literatures 6 to 8).
However, since 18F has a half-life of 110 minutes, there is a need for a synthesis method that enables efficient and short-time production of a compound for use as a PET imaging agent. In the process of synthesis of [18F]FBnTP, the use of a highly corrosive brominating agent is needed at the step of synthesizing benzyl bromide by bromination-this use has caused a problem with automatic synthesis using a synthesizer. Also, [18F]FBnTP has the property of accumulating not only in the myocardium but also in the liver adjacent to the myocardium to the same extent, and so there is concern that [18F]FBnTP has a negative effect on myocardial perfusion imaging.
Shoup, et al. also reported PET myocardial imaging using (4-[18F]fluorophenyOtriphenylphosphonium (FTPP) (Non-Patent Literature 9). However, the synthesis of FTPP has some problems in that a high temperature of 200° C. is required for labeling with 18F, and the radiochemical yield of [18F]FTPP is as low as about 10%. Likewise, (6-[18F]fluorohexyl)triphenylphosphonium reported by Kim, et al. (Non-Patent Literature 10) is problematic in practical use because the temperature condition of 220° C. is used for its synthesis.
An object of the present invention is to provide a production method that enables effective and short-time production of a quaternary phosphonium compound labeled with a radionuclide, in particular a positron emitting nuclide such as 18F. Another object of this invention is to provide a quaternary phosphonium compound labeled with a radionuclide, in particular a positron emitting nuclide such as 18F, and especially to provide a quaternary phosphonium compound that is suitable as a PET imaging agent useful for imaging of the myocardium and the like.

[As used in this scheme, Ar1, Ar2, Ar3, X1, A1, X− are as defined hereinabove.]
The aforementioned reaction can be effected by performing heating (at a temperature of, for example, 50-150° C., specifically 90-120° C., more specifically 105-115° C.) in the presence of an appropriate solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, DMSO, DMF, toluene, xylene). The reaction period can be set to be in the range of, for example, 5-60 minutes. This reaction can be performed, for example, under pressure by heating in a sealed container.
The production method of the present invention, together with preparation of a labeled precursor, can be performed according to the scheme given below.
[As used in this scheme, Ar2, Ar3, X1, A1 and X− are as defined hereinabove; n is an integer selected from 1 to 4; R1 is a group selected from B2 defined above; A2 is selected from -(C1-6alkylene)-, -(C1-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-, -(C1-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-, -O-(C2-6alkylene)-, -O-(C2-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-, and -O-(C2-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-O-(C2-6alkylene)-; X2 is a leaving group.]
As [18F]KF used at the first step of fluorination, there can be used an aqueous solution of [18F]KF/K2CO3 which is obtained by, for example, irradiating [18O]H2O with a proton beam using a cyclotron to thereby generate 18F− and reacting 18F− with K2CO3. The [18F] fluorination reaction can be effected by performing heating (at a temperature of, for example, 80-150° C., specifically 100-120° C., more specifically 110° C.) in the presence of an appropriate solvent (e.g., acetonitrile, DMSO, DMF, DMA). The reaction period can be set to be in the range of, for example, 5-60 minutes, specifically 5-20 minutes, and more specifically set to 10 minutes. This reaction can be performed, for example, under pressure by heating in a sealed container. At the fluorination step, an additive like [2,2,2] cryptand (1,10-diaza-4,7,13,16,24,24-hexaoxabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane, Kryptofix® [2,2,2]) can be used to improve reaction efficiency. The aforementioned fluorination step can be performed by, for example, the following procedure: an aqueous solution of [18F]KF/K2CO3 and [2,2,2]cryptand are azeotropically dried to give solids, a solution of phosphine serving as a substrate is added to the solids, and then the contents are heated under sealing.
The leaving group (X2) used at the aforementioned step is a halogen atom, optionally substituted C1-6alkylsulfonyloxy, or optionally substituted phenylsulfonyloxy, and preferred examples include, but are not limited to, bromine atom, iodine atom, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, methanesulfonyloxy, chloromethanesulfonyloxy, and trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy.
The second step can be performed by the same procedure as scheme A. The two steps of scheme B can be performed in a one-pot reaction: for example, after completion of the fluorination reaction, an electrophilic reagent is added to the reaction system without posttreatment and the contents are heated under sealing to obtain a product of interest.
Purification of a product of interest can be conducted by a common method: for example, purification can be done using preparative HPLC based on radiation intensity. Alternatively, purification can also be done easily using a small disposable column cartridge (Sep-Pak®) or the like.
The imaging agent of the present invention can be prepared by dissolving or suspending the positron emitting nuclide-labeled quaternary phosphonium compound into physiological saline or the like. The imaging agent may contain any additives such as pH adjustor, resolvent, dispersant, solubilizer, and radical scavenger (radiolysis inhibitor) depending on the need.
The dose of the imaging agent of this invention can be selected, as appropriate, depending on various factors including the organ to be imaged and the body shape of a subject (patient). The imaging agent of this invention can comprise a therapeutically and/or prophylactically effective amount of the compound of formula (I) given above. In this invention, the compound of formula (I) can be generally used at a dose of 0.001 mg/body kg.

Procedure for 18F-Labeling Reaction
A 12 MeV proton beam accelerated by the cyclotron Cypris HM12 (produced by Sumitomo Heavy Industries, Ltd.) was irradiated to [18O]H2O with an isotropic purity of 97% or higher (produced by Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation) for 40 minutes, thereby effecting an 18O(p,n)18F nuclear reaction to synthesize 18F−. Then, the solution was passed through a cation exchange resin (AG1-X8) to trap 18F− on the resin. The trapped 18F− was eluted with a 33 mM solution of K2CO3 to give an aqueous solution of [18F]KF/K2CO3. An appropriate amount of radioactivity (55-65 mCi) of the aqueous solution was taken in a volume of about 150-250 μL, and added to a reaction vial containing 800 μL of a Kryptfix® 2.2.2. MeCN solution (20 mg/mL), and the contents were azeotropically dried under stream of helium in an oil bath at 100° C. Then, 600 μL each of the prepared different MeCN solutions of labeling precursor {3 mg (6.30 μmol)/600 μL} was added to the reaction vial, and an 18F fluorination reaction was performed at 100° C. for 10 minutes. Next, to take the second step of phosphonium compound formation, 315 μmol (50 eq. relative to precursor) of the corresponding bromide (alkylating agent) was added to the vial, and a phosphonium compound formation reaction was performed at 100° C. for an appropriate time for each case. After the reaction, the vial was lifted from the oil bath, and 5 mL of water was added to the vial. The solution contained in the vial was introduced into a Sep-Pak® tC18 cartridge which had been activated in advance by introducing 5 mL of ethanol and water (10 mL), and then the Sep-Pak® tC18 cartridge was washed by introducing water (10 mL). After air was introduced to remove water in the cartridge, the solution containing an [18F]-labeled compound was eluted from the cartridge using ethanol (5 mL). The eluate was diluted with water (1 mL) and the resulting solution was introduced into a preparative HPLC column to effect separation and purification (preparative column: Inertsil® ODS-4, 10 mm×250 mm; mobile phase: PBS:MeCN=52:48; flow rate: 5.0 mL/min.; detection UV wavelength: 254 nm). The desired radioactive fraction was fractionated and diluted with pure water (20 mL). The fraction solution was introduced into a Sep-Pak® tC18 cartridge which had been activated in advance by introducing ethanol (5 mL) and water (10 mL), and then the Sep-Pak® tC18 cartridge was washed by introducing water (10 mL). After air was introduced to remove water in the cartridge, the [18F]-labeled compound was eluted from the cartridge into a vial using ethanol (5 mL). The eluate was azeotropically dried under stream of helium in an oil bath at 100° C. Thereafter, an appropriate amount of physiological saline was added to the reaction vial, and the resulting solution was used as a chemical solution for use in biological analysis.
The compounds of working examples as shown below were synthesized by the same procedure as mentioned above.

In the process of the synthesis of the labeled compound [18F]TAP-006, 3-iodopropylbenzene was used as an alkylating agent. Since 3-iodopropylbenzene is solid, after the first step of fluorination reaction, acetonitrile was once distilled away and then a solution of the reagent in acetonitrile (78 mg (50 eq.)/600 μL) was added again, and thereafter the second reaction step was performed. The other synthesis operations were done by the same procedure as the aforementioned procedure for 18F-labeling reaction. The total label synthesis time taken until the completion of preparing the formulation was about 1.5 hours, the radiochemical yield was 21% (corrected for attenuation), and the radiochemical purity was at least 99%.

Test Example 1
Mouse PET/CT Imaging
The animals used in this measurement were 6-10-week-old male Slc:ICR mice (from Japan SLC, Inc.). Each of different physiological saline solutions of the [18F]-labeled compounds (200 μL, 1.94-14.7 MBq) used in this measurement was administered via the caudal vein to the awake mice, and the mice were left to settle for 50 minutes. Then, the mice were fixed under isoflurane anesthesia (2%, 1.5 mL/min.), and after 60 minutes of the administration, the whole bodies of the mice were imaged by small-animal PET (ClairvivoPET produced by Shimadzu Corporation) for 10 minutes. Subsequently, while the mice were kept fixed, their whole bodies were imaged by small-animal CT (ClairvivoCT produced by Shimadzu Corporation). The PET data were reconstructed by 3D-DRAMA, and the pixel values of the obtained PET images were converted to SUV to generate SUV images. These images were fused with CT images to produce fused images. The results are shown in FIG. 2.
The accumulation of radioactivity in the myocardium was observed in all the cases of using [18F]TAP-001, −018, −019, and −022 -this confirmed that these compounds are usable for myocardial imaging. In particular, high-contrast myocardial images were obtained in the cases of using [18F]TAP-018, −019, and −022.
Test Example 2
Mouse Biodistribution Study
The animals used in this measurement were 6-8-week-old male Slc:ICR mice (from Japan SLC, Inc.) (n=4). Each of different physiological saline solutions of the [18F]-labeled compounds (200 μL, 370-740 kBq) used in this measurement was administered to the awake mice via the caudal vein, and after 60 or 120 minutes of the administration, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anesthesia. After blood was sampled from the heart immediately, the heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, thigh muscle, thigh bone, and brain were excised and measured for amount of radioactivity by a γ counter. The weights of the excised organs were measured, and on that basis, the accumulation rates per gram of the organs with respect to dose (% dose/g of organ, % ID/g) were calculated as indicators for accumulation of the chemical compounds used (n=4). The results are shown in FIG. 3.
The accumulation of labeled compound in the myocardium was observed in all the cases of using [18F]TAP-001, −018, −019, and −022 -this confirmed that the radioactivity more highly accumulates in the myocardium than in other adjacent organs. In particular, the ratio of radioactivity accumulations in the myocardium and liver (heart/liver ratio)-those accumulations were considered most likely to affect imaging-was calculated and found to be 2.70 for [18F]TAP-001, 9.40 for [18F]TAP-018, 4.56 for [18F]TAP-019, or 4.98 for [18F]TAP-022, at the time point of 60 minutes. This demonstrated that all the compounds accumulate in a heart-specific manner.
Test Example 3
Rat Biodistribution Study
The biodistribution study of [18F]TAP-018 in rats was conducted by the same procedure as in Test Example 2 using 6-week-old male Wistar rats (from Japan SLC, Inc.) (n=4). The results are summarized in a bar graph (FIG. 4). [18F]TAP-018 highly accumulated in the heart, and the heart/liver ratio was found to be about 15.5 at the time point of 60 minutes. This value is about ten times higher than the value of 1.5 for [18F]FBnTP which has been used as a gold standard, and is sufficiently higher than the value of 9.2 for [18F]FTPP which is currently under clinical study. This demonstrates that [18F]TAP-018 is useful as a myocardial perfusion imaging agent.
Test Example 4
Small-Animal PET Study in Rats
The myocardial imaging study of [18F]TAP-018 in rats was conducted using 6-week-old male Wistar rats. 200 μL (7.83-9.66 MBq) of a physiological saline solution of the test compound [18F]TAP-018 was administered via the caudal vein to the rats fixed under isoflurane anesthesia (2%, 1.5 mL/min.), and then the whole bodies of the rats were imaged by small-animal PET at time points from 0 to 120 minutes after the administration. Subsequently, while the rats were kept fixed, their whole bodies were imaged by small-animal CT. The PET data were reconstructed by 3D-DRAMA, and the pixel values of the obtained PET images were converted to SUV to generate SUV images. These images were fused with CT images to produce fused images. Further, the locations of the myocardium, lung and liver were identified based on the fused images, and regions of interest (ROI) were drawn to calculate respective SUVavg values. FIG. 5A shows the PET images taken until 60 minutes after the administration. FIG. 5B shows the radioactivity-time curves in the heart, liver and lung. As evident, radioactivity disappeared rapidly from the liver until 10 minutes after the administration, whereas a high level of radioactivity accumulated in the heart immediately after the administration. These results of PET imaging demonstrated that [18F]TAP-018 is useful as a myocardial perfusion agent.
