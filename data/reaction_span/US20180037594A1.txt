FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel oxadiazolopyridine derivatives, that are inhibitors of the ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT), to processes for their preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and to their medical use for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases which can be influenced by the modulation of the function of the ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT). Particularly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and/or therapy of metabolic diseases, such as obesity, including, but not limited to obesity in patients suffering from Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS), insulin resistance and diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Ghrelin O-Acyltransferase (GOAT) is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) protein family, and the only enzyme in humans capable of promoting an acylation reaction on the peptide hormone ghrelin. By linking a medium-chain fatty acid to the Serine-3 position of the 28-amino acid peptide, GOAT converts unacylated ghrelin (UAG) to acylated ghrelin (AG) which is the natural ligand of the ghrelin receptor GHSR1a (growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a). The ghrelin receptor is expressed in various areas of the brain involved in energy homeostasis. Activation of the receptor by AG results in stimulation of neuronal pathways leading to increased food intake, fat deposition and weight gain thus linking the ghrelin system to obesity. In humans, AG in plasma peaks immediately before mealtimes and drops in response to food intake (D. E. Cummings et al., Diabetes (2001) 50(8), 1714-1719). Infusion of AG has been shown to increase food intake in lean and obese subjects (M. R. Druce et al., Int. J. Obes. (2005), 29(9), 1130-1136). So far no receptor has been identified for UAG, but it has been shown to have functional antagonistic effects to AG at least with respect to its metabolic properties (W. Zhang et al., Endocrinology (2008) 149 (9), 4710-4716). Since an inhibitor of GOAT would substantially diminish the level of the GHSR1a ligand AG and concomitantly increase the functional antagonist UAG, it would be useful for the treatment of obesity as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management.
Insatiable hunger and severe obesity are characteristic features of the Prader-Willi-Syndrome (PWS), a genetically caused orphan disease with a complex pathology. AG levels in plasma of PWS subjects are elevated and AG/UAG ratios are increased suggesting a causal relationship (N. Wierup et al., Regulatory Peptides (2002) 107, 63-69; R. J. Kuppens et al., Endocrine (2015) 50(3), 633-642). Therefore GOAT inhibitors may be effective in reducing food craving behavior and body weight in PWS patients ameliorating one major burden affecting the patients and their families.
Furthermore the ghrelin system seems to play a major role in glucose homeostasis. Administration of AG to human subjects leads to suppression of glucose-induced insulin secretion and an increase in plasma glucose. Infusion of UAG is able to counteract the hyperglycemic effect of AG (F. Broglio et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. (2004) 89, 3062-3065). The expression of GOAT, ghrelin and GHSR1a in human pancreatic islets suggests a paracrine role on insulin secretion (A. DelParigi et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. (2002) 87(12), 5461-5464). In addition UAG promotes pancreatic 3-cell and human islet cell survival in vitro (R. Granata et al., Endocrinology (2007) 148(2), 512-529) and prevents diabetes in streptozotocin treated rats (R. Granata et al., J. Med. Chem. (2012) 55(6), 2585-2596). Thus treatment with a GOAT inhibitor is expected to improve glucose homeostasis in patients with type 2 diabetes or obese with impaired glucose tolerance.
OBJECT OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
The object of the present invention is to provide new compounds, hereinafter described as compounds of formula I, in particular new oxadiazolopyridine derivatives, which are active with regard to the ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT), notably they are ghrelin O-acyl transferase (GOAT) inhibitors.

As illustrated in Scheme 1 reacting of the acetylacetone with an alkylating agent of Formula II (Y═Cl, Br, I, OMs, OTs) in the presence of a suitable base such as potassium, sodium or caesium carbonate, in a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethanol, provides a compound of Formula III.
Reacting of the compound of Formula III with the 4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazole-3-carbonitrile (Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds (New York, N.Y., United States), 1994, vol. 30, #5 p. 608-611) in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as tin (IV) chloride, in a suitable solvent such as toluene or benzene, provides a compound of Formula I.
As illustrated in Scheme 2 reacting of the ethyl acetoacetate with the 4-amino-1,2,5-oxadiazole-3-carbonitrile (Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds (New York, N.Y., United States), 1994, vol. 30, #5 p. 608-611) in the presence of a suitable Lewis acid such as tin (IV) chloride, in a suitable solvent such as toluene or benzene, provides ester IV.
Reduction of the esther IV with the reducing agent such as sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminiumhydride (Red-Al®) or lithium aluminium hydride, in a suitable solvent such as toluene/tetrahydrofuran mixture, provides alcohol V. Alcohol V can be converted into the corresponding derivatives VI using suitable reagents and solvents, such as: thionylchloride in dimethylformamide (to prepare VIa); phosphorus tribromide in dichloromethane (to prepare VIb); glacial acetic acid (to prepare VIc).
Iodide of formula VII can be converted into the corresponding hetarylmagnesium chloride of formula VIII using suitable reagent such as isopropylmagnesium chloride lithium chloride complex, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. Reacting of hetarylmagnesium chloride of formula VIII with the compound of formula VI in the presence of copper(I)cyanide di(lithium chloride) complex, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, provides a compound of formula I.
As illustrated in Scheme 3 saponification of the ester of formula IV, using a suitable reagent such as lithium, sodium or potassium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, methanol or ethanol, provides an acid of formula IX. Reacting of the acid of formula IX with N-iodosuccinimide, in the presence of a suitable base such as sodium hydrogen carbonate, in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile, provides a compound of formula X. The protection and deprotection of functional groups is described in ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’, T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, Wiley-Interscience. For example, for the protection of an amine of Formula X, N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal may be used in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide to provide a compound of Formula XI.
Zincation of a compound of formula XI may be carried out in situ using a suitable reagent such as diisopropylzinc, in the presence of lithium acetylacetonate, in a suitable solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone. These can be coupled in a (transition) metal catalyzed reaction with a compound of formula II (Y═Br, I) using a suitable catalyst such as [1,1'-bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloro-palladium(II), in a suitable solvent such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone to provide a compound of formula XII. Deprotection a compound of formula XII with concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid, in a suitable solvent such as methanol or ethanol, provides a compound of formula I.
Further modifications of compounds of formula I by methods known in the art and illustrated in the Examples below, may be used to prepare additional compounds of the invention.
The synthetic routes presented may rely on the use of protecting groups. For example, potentially reactive groups present, such as hydroxy, carbonyl, carboxy, amino, alkylamino, or imino, may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction. Suitable protecting groups for the respective functionalities and their removal are well known to the one skilled in the art and are described in the literature of organic synthesis for example in “Protecting Groups, 3rd Edition”, Philip J. Kocienski, Theime, 2005 or “Greene's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Edition”, Peter G. M. Wuts, Theadora W. Greene, John Wiley and Sons, 2007.
The compounds of general formula I may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers as mentioned below. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their cis and trans isomers and racemic compounds may be separated into their enantiomers.
The cis/trans mixtures may be resolved, for example, by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof. The compounds of general formula I which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se into their optical antipodes and diastereomeric mixtures of compounds of general formula I may be resolved into their diastereomers by taking advantage of their different physico-chemical properties using methods known per se, e.g. chromatography and/or fractional crystallization; if the compounds obtained thereafter are racemates, they may be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned below.
The racemates are preferably resolved by column chromatography on chiral phases or by crystallization from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as esters or amides with the racemic compound. Salts may be formed with enantiomerically pure acids for basic compounds and with enantiomerically pure bases for acidic compounds. Diastereomeric derivatives are formed with enantiomerically pure auxiliary compounds, e.g. acids, their activated derivatives, or alcohols. Separation of the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained may be achieved by taking advantage of their different physico-chemical properties, e.g. differences in solubility; the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids commonly used for such a purpose as well as optically active alcohols applicable as auxiliary residues are known to those skilled in the art.
As mentioned above, the compounds of formula I may be converted into salts, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like.
For example, such salts include salts from benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, gentisic acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, 4-methyl-benzenesulfonic acid, phosphoric acid, salicylic acid, succinic acid, sulfuric acid and tartaric acid.
Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be formed with cations from ammonia, L-arginine, calcium, 2,2'-iminobisethanol, L-lysine, magnesium, N-methyl-D-glucamine, potassium, sodium and tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane.
The compounds according to the invention are advantageously also obtainable using the methods described in the examples that follow, which may also be combined for this purpose with methods known to the skilled man from the literature.

Pharmacological Activity
Determination of hGOAT Activity in HEK293 Cells after Incubation with Test Compound
Principle:
HEK293 cells stably transfected with two expression vectors, one coding for preproghrelin cDNA and a second for the expression of human GOATcDNA are used as a cellular model. After feeding the cells with octanoic acid for 5 hours, acyl-ghrelin is measured in cell culture medium by an ELISA procedure.
Materials:
Cellline: Hek293 hGOAT/PPGhrl Clone #1B8Sodium octanoate, Sigma, Cat.-No. C5038
BSA: Sigma, Cat.-No. A8806
BD Poly-D-Lysin 384-well Plates, black-clear polystyrene BD Bioscience Cat.-No. 356697348-well ELISA human acylated Ghrelin Kit purchased from Bertin Pharman (detailed composition of buffers e.g. wash-puffer, ELISA buffer not known)
All further reagents used were of highest analytical grade available.
Method:
Cells are plated with a density of 5000 cells/well in 384-well poly-D-lysin plates and incubated for 1 day at 37° C., 5% CO2 in DMEM medium, 10% FCS, 1×NEAA, Puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) and G418 (1 mg/ml). Then the medium is changed to a identical medium without FCS and containing Octanoate-BSA (final concentration 100 μM each) and compound in DMSO (final DMSO concentration 0.3%). After incubation for 5 hours acylghrelin in the medium is measured by ELISA
The medium sample is diluted 1:25 in Elisa buffer, A 25 ul aliquot is transferred to a 384-well ELISA plate previously washed 4 times with 100 μL wash buffer, and 25 μl tracer-solution is added. After incubation overnight (˜20 h) at 4° C. temperature the plate is washed 4 times with 100 μl wash-buffer per well. Finally 50 μl Ellman's reagent is added to each well and the plate is incubated in the dark for 20 minutes. The absorbance is measured at 405 nm in an Envision multilabel reader and the amount of acylated ghrelin is calculated according to a acylated ghrelin standard curve provided in the same plate.
Each assay plate contains wells with vehicle controls (1% DMSO) for the measurement of non-inhibited transfer reaction (=100% Ctl) and wells with 10 μM ([Dap3]-Ghrelin) as controls for fully inhibited GOAT enzyme
The analysis of the data is performed by calculation of the percentage of acyl-ghrelin produced in the presence of test compound compared to the amount of acyl-ghrelin produced in the vehicle control samples. An inhibitor of the GOAT enzyme will give values between 100% CTL (no inhibition) and 0% CTL (complete inhibition).
IC50 values are calculated with Assay Explorer or other suited software based on curve fitting of results of 8 different compound concentrations.
