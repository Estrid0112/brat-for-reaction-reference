Prior arts
Phosphodiesterase (PDE) catalyzes the hydrolization of cyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP, and regulates various physiological responses by controlling the intramolecular concentrations of these two important second messengers. The abnormal intramolecular regulation of the cyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP is the cause of many diseases, there are already a number of drugs that can improve and treat diseases by inhibiting the PDE activity, such as PDE5 inhibitors for pulmonary hypertension and PDE4 inhibitors for arthritis caused by psoriasis. There are eleven categories of the currently known phosphodiesterase genes, each category can be expressed in several subtypes, with a total of more than 100 PDE subtypes. Different subtypes have different structure and different tissue distribution, the activity of cyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP and the physiological function of regulation are also very different.
PDE2 phosphodiesterase can catalyze the hydrolization of cyclic nucleotides cGMP and cAMP, meanwhile cAMP activity is regulated by cGMP, which plays a key role in intracellular balance of cGMP and cAMP function. PDE2 is widely expressed in human tissues, mainly distributed in the heart, central nervous system, liver, adrenal gland, endothelial cells, and platelets and so on. PDE2 is involved in regulating various physiological activities, such as learning, memory and cognitive processes of the maincenter, the maintenance of the basic rhythm of the heart, smooth muscle and endothelial cells, the maintenance of the permeability of endothelial cells, the regulation of inflammatory response. The knockout of the PDE2 gene will lead to the death of mouse embryos. Inhibition of PDE2 activity may be used for a variety of maincenter diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and controlling inflammation.
The non-selective PDE inhibitory activity of a variety of natural and synthetic purine compounds has been found very early, such as caffeine, theophylline, pentoxifylline and so on. Pentoxifylline (PDE2 activity) has been approved for clinical use in lower limbs claudication caused by peripheral vascular occlusion, the main functions of which are reducing blood viscosity, improving erythrocyte deformation, inhibiting platelet aggregation, etc. Novel high-selectivitive PDE2 inhibitors have also been reported to control the division of endothelial cells and the regeneration of blood vessels, and to improve maincenter disgnosia. However, overall, the development and application of novel selectivitive PDE2 inhibitors are still very limited, and the discovery and application of novel PDE2 inhibitors has broad prospects.
Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a cytokine with multiple biological activities, which has a significant impact on the occurrence, development and prognosis of multiple diseases. TNFα is mainly produced by monocytes and macrophage cells, which is involved in the immunomodulation and the cytokine network coordination. Under normal circumstances, TNFα plays an important role in immune defense and immune surveillance, but in some cases it has adverse effects. Research shows that the overexpression of TNFα can induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukon 1 (IL-1) and IL-6, increase the permeability of endothelial cells and up-regulate the expression of adhesion molecules and activate neutrophils and eosinophils, and induce bone synovial cells and cartilage cells to secrete acute phase substances and tissue-degrading enzymes and the like to promote the occurrence of inflammation. These pathologic reactions play a very important role in occurrence and development of many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA) and vasculitis, etc. Studies have shown that TNFα is an ideal target for above multiple IMIDs, and the use of TNFα antagonists (TNFα inhibitors) to neutralize excess TNFα is an ideal way to effectively prevent chronic inflammatory diseases due to TNFα overexpression. PDE2 regulates the expression of TNFα according to the mechanism, therefor the level of TNFα can be controlled by regulating the PDE2 activity, so as to control the inflammation.

The present invention envisages all of this class of compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (-)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and - enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomer, (L)-isomer, as well as racemic mixtures and other mixtures, such as enantiomers- or diastereoisomers-enriched mixtures, all of these mixtures are within the scope of the present invention. Other asymmetric carbon atoms may exist in substituents such as in an alkyl. All of these isomers and their mixtures are included within the scope of the present invention.
Optically active (R)- and -isomers, (D)- and (L)-isomers can be prepared by chiral synthesis or chiral reagents or other conventional techniques. If an enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is wanted, asymmetric synthesis or derivatization action of the chiral auxiliaries can be employed in preparation, in which the resulting diastereomer mixtures are isolated, and the auxiliary groups are cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomer. Alternatively, when a molecule contains an alkaline functional group (such as amino) or an acidic functional groups (such as carboxyl), a salt of diastereomer is formed with an appropriate optical active acid or alkali, and then the pure enantiomer can be recycled after resolution on the salt of diastereomer by common methods which is known in the art. In addition, the separation of an enantiomer and a diastereomer is usually realized by the chromatographic method, the chromatography method employs a chiral stationary phase, and optionally combined with the chemical derivatization method (e.g. an amine generates a carbamate).

The term "a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any formulation or carrier medium which is capable of delivering effective amount of the active substance disclosed in the present invention, does not interfere with the biological activity of the active substance, and is with no toxic side-effects on host or patient, representative carrier includes water, oil, vegetables and minerals, cream base, lotion matrix, ointment matrix etc. The matrix comprises a suspension, a viscosity increaser, transdermal enhancers etc. Their formulation are well known to the person in cosmetic or topical drug art. For additional information about the carrier, reference can be made to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005), the content of which is incorporated into this article as reference.
The term "excipient" usually refers to a carrier, diluent and/or medium required for the preparation of an effective pharmaceutical composition.
In terms of drug or pharmacological active agent, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to enough quantity of the drug or formulation that can achieve desired effects but is with no toxicity. For the oral formulation of the present invention, "an effective amount" of one active substance in the composition is the amount required to achieve desired effects in combination with another active substance in the composition. The determination of the effective amount varies from person to person, which depends on the age and the general situation of the recipient, also on the specific active substance. In one case, an appropriate effective amount can be determined by the person skilled in the art according to conventional tests.
The term "active ingredient", "therapeutic agent", "active substance" or "active agent" refers to a chemical entity, which can effectively treat disorder, illness or disease of a target subject.
The term "substituted" refers to one or more hydrogen atoms in a specific atom optionally substituted by a substituent, including a deuterium and a variant of hydrogen, as long as the valence state of the specific atom is normal and the compound obtained after substitution is stable. When the substituent is a ketone group (i.e. =O), it means that two hydrogen atoms are substituted. A substitution of ketone group does not occur in an aryl. The term "optionally substituted" means that it may be substituted or not be substituted, unless otherwise specified, the type and number of substituents can be arbitrary under the premise of stability available in chemistry.
When any parameter (e.g. R) shows an occurrence for more than one time in the composition or structure of the compound, the definition of each occurrence is independent. Therefore, for example, if a group is substituted by 0-2 of R, the group may optionally be substituted by at most two R, and R has an independent option in each case. In addition, the combination of substituents and/or their variants is allowed only if such a combination will lead to a stable compound.
When one of the parameters is selected from a single bond, it indicates that the two groups to which it is attached are directly connected, for example, when the L in A-L-Z represents a single bond, it indicates that the structure actually is A-Z.
When bonds of a substituent can be crossly connected to two atoms of a ring, the substituent can be bonded to arbitrary atoms in the ring. When the listed substituent does not specify through which atom it is connected to the compound included in the general structure formula but not specifically mentioned, the substituent can be bonded through any of its atoms. The combination of substituents and/or their variants is allowed only if such a combination will lead to a stable compound. For example, the moietyrepresents that the substituent can be connected on any atom in the cyclohexyl or cyclohexadiene.

The ring includes a single ring, a joint ring, a spiro ring, a fused ring or a bridged ring. A number of the atoms in the ring is usually defined as the member of the ring, for example, "5- to 7- membered ring" is a ring looped with 5 to 7 atoms. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally contains 1-3 of heteroatoms. Therefore, "5- to 7- membered ring" includes, for example, phenyl pyridine and piperidinyl; on the other hand, the term "5- to 7- membered heterocycloalkyl ring" includes pyridyl and piperidinyl, but does not include phenyl. The term "ring" also includes a ring system containing at least one ring, wherein each ring is of the above definition independently.
Unless otherwise specified, the term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclyl" refers to a stable monocyclic, bicyclic or tricyclic ring containing a heteroatom and a heteroatomic group, they can be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated (aromatic), they contain carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3 or 4 of heteroatom in the ring which is independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S, wherein any of the heterocycle can be fused to a benzene ring to form a bicyclic ring. Nitrogen and sulfur atoms can be optionally oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O)p). The nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e. N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituent that has been defined herein). The heterocycle can be attached to the side group of any heteroatom or carbon atom to form a stable structure. If the formed compound is stable, the heterocycle described herein can be substituted on its carbon or nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom in the heterocycle is optionally quaternized. As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the total number of S and O atoms contained in the heterocycle exceeds 1, these heteroatoms are not adjacent to each other. As another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is no more than 1. As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocyclic group" or "heteroaryl" refers to a stable 5-, 6-, 7-membered monocycle or bicycle or 7-, 8-, 9- or 10-membered bicyclic heteroaromatic ring, which contains carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3 or 4 of heteroatom in the ring which independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. The nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e. N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituent that has been defined herein). Nitrogen and sulfur atoms can be optionally oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O)p). It is worth noting that, the total number of S and O atoms in the heteroaromatic ring is no more than 1.

The 48-well plate was placed in a cell incubator, incubated for 30 minutes and then removed, added with 40 µL LPS solution (100 µg/mL), mixed and placed in the incubator to continue the incubation. 5 hours later, the 48-well plate was removed and the blood sample was transferred to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged in a centrifuge (4,500 rpm, 4°C, 5 minutes). The plasma was separated from the supernatant, frozen quickly after packing and stored in -80°C refrigerator. The next day the R&D ELISA kit was used to measure TNF-α levels in plasma samples according to the instructions of the kit.
