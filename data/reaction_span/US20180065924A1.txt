To the organic layer, 25 parts of ion-exchanged water were added and stirred at 23° C. for 30 minutes for washing, followed by separating an organic layer: The organic layer was washed five times with ion-exchanged water in this manner.
Then the resultant mixture was concentrated. To the obtained residue, 20 parts of tert-butylmethylether was added and the resultant mixture was stirred, and then its supernatant was removed therefrom.
The obtained residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and then concentrated to obtain 4.26 parts of the salt represented by formula (I-16).

Those monomers are sometimes referred to as “Monomer (X)” in which (X) represents the sign of the formula corresponding to the monomer. For example, the monomer represented by formula (a1-1-2) is referred to as “Monomer (a1-1-2)”.
Resin Synthesis Example 1
The monomers (a1-1-2), (a1-2-9), (a2-1-1) and (a3-4-2) were mixed in a molar ratio of 35/24/2.5/38.5 (monomer (a1-1-2)/monomer (a1-2-9)/monomer (a2-1-1)/monomer (a3-4-2)), and propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate was added in 1.5 times parts based on total parts of all monomers to prepare a mixture. To the mixture, azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator in a ratio of 1 mol % based on all monomer molar amount and azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) as an initiator in a ratio of 3 mol % based on all monomer molar amount were added, and the obtained mixture was heated at 73° C. for about 5 hours. The reaction mixture obtained was poured into a large amount of a mixture of methanol and water to cause precipitation, followed by being filtrated. The collected precipitate was dissolved in propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate, and then a large amount of the mixture of methanol and water was added thereto to cause precipitation, followed by being filtrated: This reprecipitation step was conducted twice. As a result, a polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of about 8,600 was obtained in a yield of 78%. The polymer had the following structural units. That resin is referred to as polymer A1.

<Evaluation>
Silicon wafers were each coated with “ARC-29”, which is an organic anti-reflective coating composition available from Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd., and then baked at 205° C. for 60 seconds, to form a 78 nm-thick organic anti-reflective coating. Each of the photoresist compositions prepared as above was spin-coated over the anti-reflective coating so that the thickness of the resulting film became 100 nm after drying. The silicon wafers thus coated with the respective photoresist compositions were each prebaked on a direct hotplate at the temperature as listed in the column “PB” of Table 5 for 60 seconds. Using an ArF excimer stepper (XT:1900G1 manufactured by ASML INC., NA=1.35, Annular σout=0.85 σin=0.65, X-Y polarization) and a mask for forming trench pattern (pitch: 120 nm, trench width: 40 nm), each wafer having the respective resist film was subjected to exposure, with the exposure quantity being varied stepwise.
After the exposure, each wafer was subjected to post-exposure baking on a hotplate at the temperature as listed in the column “PEB” of Table 5 for 60 seconds and then to development for 20 seconds at 23° C. with butyl acetate (Tokyo Chemical Industries, Co., Ltd.) in the manner of dynamic dispense method to produce a negative photoresist pattern.
In the following evaluation, effective sensitivity (ES) means the exposure quantity with which exposure using the above-mentioned mask provides a pattern with 40 nm of the trench width after development.
<Evaluation of Focus Margin [DOF]>
Negative photoresist patterns were produced in the same manner as described above except that exposure was conducted at the effective sensitivity with the focus point distance being varied stepwise.
The focus range where the resulting photoresist patterns exhibited a trench pattern width of 40 nm±5% (between 38 nm and 42 nm) was taken as DOF (nm). The results were listed in Table 6.
