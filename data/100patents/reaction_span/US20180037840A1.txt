FIELD
The present invention relates to lubricating oil compositions comprising a lubricating oil base stock and a compound of formula (I), or a salt thereof. The lubricating oil compositions of this disclosure may be used to reduce friction in engines or other mechanical components, which may be lubricated with a lubricating oil. For example, the lubricating oil compositions of this disclosure may be used in automotive, marine, aviation, industrial engine and machine component applications, and the like.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Improving frictional properties in lubricant compositions has been an objective of the industry. Friction between two surfaces will increase the power required to effect movement, and where the movement is an integral part of an energy conversion system, it is most desirable to effect lubrication in a manner that will minimize this friction. By minimizing friction in a lubricant system, fuel economy and energy efficiency are maximized. Friction modifiers have been used to promote such friction-reducing properties in lubricant systems.
A variety of friction modifiers are known in the art and include both ash and ashless modifiers. Recent emission concerns have resulted in a preference for ashless friction modifiers, such as fatty acid esters and amides. While efficacious, fatty acids tend to have a low solubility in base oil, decompose over time, and increase the acidity of the formulation.
Currently, there is a need for ashless additives that effectively reduce the friction coefficient of oil-based lubricants, but have improved solubility in base oil and/or sustained performance over time.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Friction modifiers, which provide thermally triggered, controlled release performance overtime, are described herein. These modifiers may have improved solubility in base oil, improve the fuel economy of, and/or reduce the emission from, engines or other mechanical components, which may be lubricated with a lubricating oil. The lubricating oil compositions of this disclosure may be used in, e.g., in automotive, marine, aviation, industrial engine and machine component applications, and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Described herein are friction modifiers that provide thermally triggered, controlled release performance overtime and that are simple to synthesize and formulate. As used herein, the term friction modifier refers to any material or materials that can alter the coefficient of friction of a surface lubricated by any lubricant or fluid containing such material(s). For both engine and industrial lubricant applications, it is important to have a lubricant formulation with a low friction coefficient. Fluids with low friction coefficients exhibit low frictional loss during lubrication, and therefore, provide improved energy and/or fuel efficiency of such formulated lubricants.
As discussed in the Examples, fatty acids (e.g., stearic acid) were incorporated into themocleavable systems; these compounds showed useful friction modifying performance over a prolonged timeframe. Specifically, experiments measuring the friction modifying capabilities in high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) analyses were performed using the compounds and compositions described herein. Certain compounds (e.g., compound (5) and compound (6)) showed friction modifying capabilities superior to a substantial majority of other additives. For example, compound (6) was shown by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy coupled with thermogravimetric analysis to thermally degrade step-wise into a compound (5) intermediate, and subsequently stearic acid, upon being exposed to temperatures greater than or equal to 200° C. within the envelope. Moreover, both compound (5) and stearic acid have been shown to possess friction modifying capabilities, as exhibited by low friction coefficients, whereas compound (6) reduces friction only after exposure to test temperatures greater than 150° C. The friction coefficient obtained for compound (5) is significantly lower than values obtained by most commercially available additives.
The lubricating oil compositions described herein, which comprise a friction modifier of the invention, may provide enhanced engine protection. Additionally, these compositions may reduce consumer costs with improved lubricant lifetime and fuel economy.

Lubricating Oil Base Stocks
As described below, lubricating base oils are known in the art. Lubricating base oils that are useful in the present disclosure include, but are not limited to, natural oils, synthetic oils, unconventional oils, and mixtures thereof. Unconventional oils may be unrefined, refined or rerefined (i.e., reclaimed or reprocessed oil). Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source and used without added purification. These include shale oil obtained directly from retorting operations, petroleum oil obtained directly from primary distillation, and ester oil obtained directly from an esterification process. Refined oils are similar to the oils discussed for unrefined oils except refined oils are subjected to one or more purification steps to improve at least one lubricating oil property. One skilled in the art is familiar with many purification processes. These processes include solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid extraction, base extraction, filtration, and percolation. Rerefined oils are obtained by processes analogous to refined oils but using an oil that has been previously used as a feed stock.
Groups I, II, III, IV and V are broad base oil stock categories developed and defined by the American Petroleum Institute (API Publication 1509; www.API.org) to create guidelines for lubricant base oils. Group I base stocks have a viscosity index of between about 80 to 120 and contain greater than about 0.03% sulfur and/or less than about 90% saturates. Group II base stocks have a viscosity index of between about 80 to 120, and contain less than or equal to about 0.03% sulfur and greater than or equal to about 90% saturates. Group III stocks have a viscosity index greater than about 120 and contain less than or equal to about 0.03% sulfur and greater than about 90% saturates. Group IV includes polyalphaolefins (PAO).

Mineral oil is a specific example of a natural oil. Mineral oils vary widely as to their crude source, for example, as to whether they are paraffinic, naphthenic, or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic. Oils derived from coal or shale are also useful. Natural oils vary also as to the method used for their production and purification, for example, their distillation range and whether they are straight run or cracked, hydrorefined, or solvent extracted.
Group II and/or Group III hydroprocessed or hydrocracked basestocks, including synthetic oils such as polyalphaolefins, alkyl aromatics and synthetic esters are also well known basestock oils.
Synthetic oils include hydrocarbon oil. Hydrocarbon oils include oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins (polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propylene isobutylene copolymers, ethylene-olefin copolymers, and ethylene-alphaolefin copolymers, for example). Polyalphaolefin (PAO) oil base stocks are commonly used synthetic hydrocarbon oil. By way of example, PAOs derived from C8, C10, C12, C14 olefins or mixtures thereof may be utilized. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,956,122; 4,827,064; and 4,827,073.
The number average molecular weights of the PAOs, which are known materials and generally available on a major commercial scale from suppliers such as ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, BP, and others, typically vary from about 250 to about 3,000, although PAO's may be made in viscosities up to about 150 cSt (100° C.). The PAOs are typically comprised of relatively low molecular weight hydrogenated polymers or oligomers of alphaolefins which include, but are not limited to, C2 to about C32 alphaolefins with the C8 to about C16 alphaolefins, such as 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene and the like, being specific alphaolefins. In certain embodiments, a polyalphaolefin may be poly-1-octene, poly-1-decene and poly-1-dodecene and mixtures thereof and mixed olefin-derived polyolefins. However, the dimers of higher olefins in the range of C14 to C18 may be used to provide low viscosity base stocks of acceptably low volatility. Depending on the viscosity grade and the starting oligomer, the PAOs may be predominantly trimers and tetramers of the starting olefins, with minor amounts of the higher oligomers, having a viscosity range of 1.5 to 12 cSt. PAO fluids of particular use may include 3.0 cSt, 3.4 cSt, and/or 3.6 cSt and combinations thereof. Mixtures of PAO fluids having a viscosity range of 1.5 to approximately 150 cSt or more may be used if desired.
The PAO fluids may be conveniently made by the polymerization of an alphaolefin in the presence of a polymerization catalyst such as the Friedel-Crafts catalysts including, for example, aluminum trichloride, boron trifluoride or complexes of boron trifluoride with water, alcohols such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, carboxylic acids or esters such as ethyl acetate or ethyl propionate. For example the methods disclosed by U.S. Pat. No. 4,149,178 or 3,382,291 may be conveniently used herein. Other descriptions of PAO synthesis are found in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,742,082; 3,769,363; 3,876,720; 4,239,930; 4,367,352; 4,413,156; 4,434,408; 4,910,355; 4,956,122; and 5,068,487. The dimers of the C14 to C18 olefins are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,218,330.
Other useful lubricant oil base stocks include wax isomerate base stocks and base oils, comprising hydroisomerized waxy stocks (e.g. waxy stocks such as gas oils, slack waxes, fuels hydrocracker bottoms, etc.), hydroisomerized Fischer-Tropsch waxes, Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) base stocks and base oils, and other wax isomerate hydroisomerized base stocks and base oils, or mixtures thereof Fischer-Tropsch waxes, the high boiling point residues of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, are highly paraffinic hydrocarbons with very low sulfur content. The hydroprocessing used for the production of such base stocks may use an amorphous hydrocracking/hydroisomerization catalyst, such as one of the specialized lube hydrocracking (LHDC) catalysts or a crystalline hydrocracking/hydroisomerization catalyst, e.g., a zeolitic catalyst. For example, one useful catalyst is ZSM-48 as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,075,269, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Processes for making hydrocracked/hydroisomerized distillates and hydrocracked/hydroisomerized waxes are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,817,693; 4,975,177; 4,921,594 and 4,897,178 as well as in British Patent Nos. 1,429,494; 1,350,257; 1,440,230 and 1,390,359. Each of the aforementioned patents is incorporated herein in their entirety. Particularly favorable processes are described in European Patent Application Nos. 464546 and 464547, also incorporated herein by reference. Processes using Fischer-Tropsch wax feeds are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,594,172 and 4,943,672, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.
Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) base oils, Fischer-Tropsch wax derived base oils, and other wax-derived hydroisomerized (wax isomerate) base oils may be advantageously used in the instant disclosure, and may have useful kinematic viscosities at 100° C. of about 3 cSt to about 50 cSt, specifically about 3 cSt to about 30 cSt, more specifically about 3.5 cSt to about 25 cSt, as exemplified by GTL 4 with kinematic viscosity of about 4.0 cSt at 100° C. and a viscosity index of about 141. These Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) base oils, Fischer-Tropsch wax derived base oils, and other wax-derived hydroisomerized base oils may have useful pour points of about −20° C. or lower, and under some conditions may have advantageous pour points of about −25° C. or lower, with useful pour points of about −30° C. to about −40° C. or lower. Useful compositions of Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) base oils, Fischer-Tropsch wax derived base oils, and wax-derived hydroisomerized base oils are recited in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,080,301; 6,090,989, and 6,165,949 for example, and are incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.
The hydrocarbyl aromatics can be used as base oil or base oil component and can be any hydrocarbyl molecule that contains at least about 5% of its weight derived from an aromatic moiety such as a benzenoid moiety or naphthenoid moiety, or their derivatives. These hydrocarbyl aromatics include alkyl benzenes, alkyl naphthalenes, alkyl diphenyl oxides, alkyl naphthols, alkyl diphenyl sulfides, alkylated bis-phenol A, alkylated thiodiphenol, and the like. The aromatic can be mono-alkylated, dialkylated, polyalkylated, and the like. The aromatic can be mono- or poly-functionalized. The hydrocarbyl groups can also be comprised of mixtures of alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl, cycloalkyl groups, cycloalkenyl groups and other related hydrocarbyl groups. The hydrocarbyl groups can range from about C6 up to about C60, with a specific range of about C8 to about C20 often being used. A mixture of hydrocarbyl groups is typical, and up to about three such substituents may be present. The hydrocarbyl group can optionally contain sulfur, oxygen, and/or nitrogen containing substituents. The aromatic group can also be derived from natural (petroleum) sources, provided at least about 5% of the molecule is comprised of an above-type aromatic moiety. Viscosities at 100° C. of approximately 3 cSt to about 50 cSt are typical, with viscosities of approximately 3.4 cSt to about 20 cSt often being used for the hydrocarbyl aromatic component. In one embodiment, an alkyl naphthalene where the alkyl group is primarily comprised of 1-hexadecene is used. Other alkylates of aromatics can be advantageously used. Naphthalene or methyl naphthalene, for example, can be alkylated with olefins such as octene, decene, dodecene, tetradecene or higher, mixtures of similar olefins, and the like. Useful concentrations of hydrocarbyl aromatic in a lubricant oil composition can be about 2% to about 25%, specifically about 4% to about 20%, and more specifically about 4% to about 15%, depending on the application.
Alkylated aromatics such as the hydrocarbyl aromatics of the present disclosure may be produced by well-known Friedel-Crafts alkylation of aromatic compounds. See Friedel-Crafts and Related Reactions, Olah, G. A. (ed.), Inter-science Publishers, New York, 1963. For example, an aromatic compound, such as benzene or naphthalene, is alkylated by an olefin, alkyl halide or alcohol in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst. See Friedel-Crafts and Related Reactions, Vol. 2, part 1, chapters 14, 17, and 18, See Olah, G. A. (ed.), Inter-science Publishers, New York, 1964. Many homogeneous or heterogeneous, solid catalysts are known to one skilled in the art. The choice of catalyst depends on the reactivity of the starting materials and product quality requirements. For example, strong acids such as AlCl3, BF3, or HF may be used.
In some cases, milder catalysts such as FeCl3 or SnCl4 are used. Newer alkylation technology uses zeolites or solid super acids.
Esters comprise a useful base stock. Additive solvency and seal compatibility characteristics may be secured by the use of esters such as the esters of dibasic acids with monoalkanols and the polyol esters of monocarboxylic acids. Esters of the former type include, for example, the esters of dicarboxylic acids such as phthalic acid, succinic acid, alkyl succinic acid, alkenyl succinic acid, maleic acid, azelaic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, fumaric acid, adipic acid, linoleic acid dimer, malonic acid, alkyl malonic acid, alkenyl malonic acid, etc., with a variety of alcohols such as butyl alcohol, hexyl alcohol, dodecyl alcohol, 2-ethylhexyl alcohol, etc. Specific examples of these types of esters include dibutyl adipate, di(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate, di-n-hexyl fumarate, dioctyl sebacate, diisooctyl azelate, diisodecyl azelate, dioctyl phthalate, didecyl phthalate, dieicosyl sebacate, etc.
Particularly useful synthetic esters are those which are obtained by reacting one or more polyhydric alcohols, specifically the hindered polyols (such as the neopentyl polyols, e.g., neopentyl glycol, trimethylol ethane, 2-methyl-2-propyl-1,3-propanediol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol) with alkanoic acids containing at least about 4 carbon atoms, specifically C5 to C30 acids such as saturated straight chain fatty acids including caprylic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, arachic acid, and behenic acid, or the corresponding branched chain fatty acids or unsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid, or mixtures of any of these materials.
Suitable synthetic ester components include the esters of trimethylol propane, trimethylol butane, trimethylol ethane, pentaerythritol and/or dipentaerythritol with one or more monocarboxylic acids containing from about 5 to about 10 carbon atoms. These esters are widely available commercially, for example, the Mobil P-41 and P-51 esters of ExxonMobil Chemical Company.
Also useful are esters derived from renewable material such as coconut, palm, rapeseed, soy, sunflower and the like. These esters may be monoesters, di-esters, polyol esters, complex esters, or mixtures thereof. These esters are widely available commercially, for example, the Mobil P-51 ester of ExxonMobil Chemical Company.
Engine oil formulations containing renewable esters are included in this disclosure. For such formulations, the renewable content of the ester is typically greater than about 70 weight percent, specifically more than about 80 weight percent and most specifically more than about 90 weight percent.
Other useful fluids of lubricating viscosity include non-conventional or unconventional base stocks that have been processed, typically catalytically, or synthesized to provide high performance lubrication characteristics.
Non-conventional or unconventional base stocks/base oils include one or more of a mixture of base stock(s) derived from one or more Gas-to-Liquids (GTL) materials, as well as isomerate/isodewaxate base stock(s) derived from natural wax or waxy feeds, mineral and or non-mineral oil waxy feed stocks such as slack waxes, natural waxes, and waxy stocks such as gas oils, waxy fuels hydrocracker bottoms, waxy raffinate, hydrocrackate, thermal crackates, or other mineral, mineral oil, or even non-petroleum oil derived waxy materials such as waxy materials received from coal liquefaction or shale oil, and mixtures of such base stocks.
GTL materials are materials that are derived via one or more synthesis, combination, transformation, rearrangement, and/or degradation/deconstructive processes from gaseous carbon-containing compounds, hydrogen-containing compounds and/or elements as feed stocks such as hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water, methane, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propane, propylene, propyne, butane, butylenes, and butynes. GTL base stocks and/or base oils are GTL materials of lubricating viscosity that are generally derived from hydrocarbons; for example, waxy synthesized hydrocarbons, that are themselves derived from simpler gaseous carbon-containing compounds, hydrogen-containing compounds and/or elements as feed stocks. GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) include oils boiling in the lube oil boiling range (1) separated/fractionated from synthesized GTL materials such as, for example, by distillation and subsequently subjected to a final wax processing step which involves either or both of a catalytic dewaxing process, or a solvent dewaxing process, to produce lube oils of reduced/low pour point; (2) synthesized wax isomerates, comprising, for example, hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized cat and/or solvent dewaxed synthesized wax or waxy hydrocarbons; (3) hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized cat and/or solvent dewaxed Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) material (i.e., hydrocarbons, waxy hydrocarbons, waxes and possible analogous oxygenates); specifically hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized/followed by cat and/or solvent dewaxing dewaxed F-T waxy hydrocarbons, or hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized/followed by cat (or solvent) dewaxing dewaxed, F-T waxes, or mixtures thereof.
GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) derived from GTL materials, especially, hydrodewaxed or hydroisomerized/followed by cat and/or solvent dewaxed wax or waxy feed, specifically F-T material derived base stock(s) and/or base oil(s), are characterized typically as having kinematic viscosities at 100° C. of from about 2 mm2/s to about 50 mm2/s (ASTM D445). They are further characterized typically as having pour points of −5° C. to about −40° C. or lower (ASTM D97). They are also characterized typically as having viscosity indices of about 80 to about 140 or greater (ASTM D2270).
In addition, the GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) are typically highly paraffinic (>90% saturates), and may contain mixtures of monocycloparaffins and multicycloparaffins in combination with non-cyclic isoparaffins. The ratio of the naphthenic (i.e., cycloparaffin) content in such combinations varies with the catalyst and temperature used. Further, GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) typically have very low sulfur and nitrogen content, generally containing less than about 10 ppm, and more typically less than about 5 ppm of each of these elements. The sulfur and nitrogen content of GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) obtained from F-T material, especially F-T wax, is essentially nil. In addition, the absence of phosphorous and aromatics make this materially especially suitable for the formulation of low SAP products.
The term GTL base stock and/or base oil and/or wax isomerate base stock and/or base oil is to be understood as embracing individual fractions of such materials of wide viscosity range as recovered in the production process, mixtures of two or more of such fractions, as well as mixtures of one or two or more low viscosity fractions with one, two or more higher viscosity fractions to produce a blend wherein the blend exhibits a target kinematic viscosity.
The GTL material, from which the GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) is/are derived is typically an F-T material (i.e., hydrocarbons, waxy hydrocarbons, wax).
In addition, the GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) are typically highly paraffinic (>90% saturates), and may contain mixtures of monocycloparaffins and multicycloparaffins in combination with non-cyclic isoparaffins. The ratio of the naphthenic (i.e., cycloparaffin) content in such combinations varies with the catalyst and temperature used. Further, GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) and hydrodewaxed, or hydroisomerized/cat (and/or solvent) dewaxed base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) typically have very low sulfur and nitrogen content, generally containing less than about 10 ppm, and more typically less than about 5 ppm of each of these elements. The sulfur and nitrogen content of GTL base stock(s) and/or base oil(s) obtained from F-T material, especially F-T wax, is essentially nil. In addition, the absence of phosphorous and aromatics make this material especially suitable for the formulation of low sulfur, sulfated ash, and phosphorus (low SAP) products.
Base oils for use in the formulated lubricating oils useful in the present disclosure are any of the variety of oils corresponding to API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V oils and mixtures thereof, specifically API Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V oils and mixtures thereof, more specifically the Group III to Group V base oils due to their exceptional volatility, stability, viscometric and cleanliness features. Minor quantities of Group I stock, such as the amount used to dilute additives for blending into formulated lube oil products, can be tolerated but should typically be kept to a minimum, i.e. amounts only associated with their use as diluent/carrier oil for additives used on an “as-received” basis. Even in regard to the Group II stocks, stocks in the higher quality range associated with that stock, i.e. a Group II stock having a viscosity index in the range 100<VI<120, may be particularly useful.
The base oil typically constitutes the major component of the engine oil lubricant composition of the present disclosure and typically is present in an amount ranging from about 50 to about 99 weight percent, specifically from about 70 to about 95 weight percent, and more specifically from about 85 to about 95 weight percent, based on the total weight of the composition. The base oil may be selected from any of the synthetic or natural oils typically used as crankcase lubricating oils for spark-ignited and compression-ignited engines. The base oil conveniently may have a kinematic viscosity, according to ASTM standards, of about 2.5 cSt to about 12 cSt (or mm2/s) at 100° C. In one embodiment the base oil may have a kinetic viscosity of about 2.5 cSt to about 9 cSt (or mm2/s) at 100° C. Mixtures of synthetic and natural base oils may be used. Bi-modal mixtures of Group I, II, III, IV, and/or V base stocks may also be used.
Other Additives
The formulated lubricating oil useful in the present disclosure may additionally contain one or more lubricating oil performance additives, which may include, but are not limited to, anti-wear additives, viscosity modifiers, antioxidants, detergents, dispersants, pour point depressants, corrosion inhibitors, metal deactivators, seal compatibility additives, anti-foam agents, other friction modifiers, anti-rust additives/inhibitors, extreme pressure additives, anti-seizure agents, wax modifiers, fluid-loss additives, lubricity agents, anti-staining agents, chromophoric agents, demulsifiers, emulsifiers, densifiers, wetting agents, gelling agents, tackiness agents, colorants, and others. For a review of many commonly used additives, see Klamann in Lubricants and Related Products, Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, Fla.; ISBN 0-89573-177-0. Reference is also made to “Lubricant Additives” by M. W. Ranney, published by Noyes Data Corporation of Parkridge, N J (1973); see also U.S. Pat. No. 7,704,930 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2015-0344805, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety. These additives are commonly delivered with varying amounts of diluent oil, that may range from 5 weight percent to 50 weight percent.
The types and quantities of performance additives used in combination with the instant disclosure in lubricant compositions are not limited by the examples shown herein as illustrations.
Dispersants
During engine operation, oil-insoluble oxidation byproducts are produced. Dispersants help keep these byproducts in solution, thus diminishing their deposition on metal surfaces. Thus, in certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more dispersants.
Dispersants used in the formulation of the lubricating oil composition may be ashless or ash-forming in nature. One particular dispersant is ashless. So called ashless dispersants are organic materials that form substantially no ash upon combustion. For example, non-metal-containing or borated metal-free dispersants are considered ashless. In contrast, metal-containing detergents discussed above form ash upon combustion.
Suitable dispersants typically contain a polar group attached to a relatively high molecular weight hydrocarbon chain. The polar group typically contains at least one element of nitrogen, oxygen, or phosphorus. Typical hydrocarbon chains contain 50 to 400 carbon atoms.
A particularly useful class of dispersants are the (poly)alkenylsuccinic derivatives, typically produced by the reaction of a long chain hydrocarbyl substituted succinic compound, usually a hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydride, with a polyhydroxy or polyamino compound. The long chain hydrocarbyl group constituting the oleophilic portion of the molecule which confers solubility in the oil, is normally a polyisobutylene group. Many examples of this type of dispersant are well known commercially and in the literature. Exemplary U.S. patents describing such dispersants are U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,172,892; 3,2145,707; 3,219,666; 3,316,177; 3,341,542; 3,444,170; 3,454,607; 3,541,012; 3,630,904; 3,632,511; 3,787,374 and 4,234,435. Other types of dispersant are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,036,003; 3,200,107; 3,254,025; 3,275,554; 3,438,757; 3,454,555; 3,565,804; 3,413,347; 3,697,574; 3,725,277; 3,725,480; 3,726,882; 4,454,059; 3,329,658; 3,449,250; 3,519,565; 3,666,730; 3,687,849; 3,702,300; 4,100,082; 5,705,458. A further description of dispersants may be found, for example, in European Patent Application No. 471 071, to which reference is made for this purpose.
Hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic acid and hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic anhydride derivatives are useful dispersants. In particular, succinimide, succinate esters, or succinate ester amides prepared by the reaction of a hydrocarbon-substituted succinic acid compound typically having at least 50 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon substituent, with at least one equivalent of an alkylene amine are particularly useful.
Succinimides are formed by the condensation reaction between hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydrides and amines. Molar ratios can vary depending on the polyamine. For example, the molar ratio of hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydride to TEPA can vary from about 1:1 to about 5:1. Representative examples are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,087,936; 3,172,892; 3,219,666; 3,272,746; 3,322,670; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,652,616, 3,948,800; and Canada Patent No. 1,094,044.
Succinate esters are formed by the condensation reaction between hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydrides and alcohols or polyols. Molar ratios can vary depending on the alcohol or polyol used. For example, the condensation product of a hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydride and pentaerythritol is a useful dispersant.
Succinate ester amides are formed by condensation reaction between hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydrides and alkanol amines. For example, suitable alkanol amines include ethoxylated polyalkylpolyamines, propoxylated polyalkylpolyamines and polyalkenylpolyamines such as polyethylene polyamines. One example is propoxylated hexamethylenediamine. Representative examples are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,305.
The molecular weight of the hydrocarbyl substituted succinic anhydrides used in the preceding paragraphs will typically range between 800 and 2,500 or more. The above products can be post-reacted with various reagents such as sulfur, oxygen, formaldehyde, carboxylic acids such as oleic acid. The above products can also be post reacted with boron compounds such as boric acid, borate esters or highly borated dispersants, to form borated dispersants generally having from about 0.1 to about 5 moles of boron per mole of dispersant reaction product.
Mannich base dispersants are made from the reaction of alkylphenols, formaldehyde, and amines. See U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,551, which is incorporated herein by reference. Process aids and catalysts, such as oleic acid and sulfonic acids, can also be part of the reaction mixture. Molecular weights of the alkylphenols range from 800 to 2,500. Representative examples are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,697,574; 3,703,536; 3,704,308; 3,751,365; 3,756,953; 3,798,165; and 3,803,039.
Typical high molecular weight aliphatic acid modified Mannich condensation products useful in this disclosure can be prepared from high molecular weight alkyl-substituted hydroxyaromatics or HNR2 group-containing reactants.
Hydrocarbyl substituted amine ashless dispersant additives are well known to one skilled in the art; see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,275,554; 3,438,757; 3,565,804; 3,755,433, 3,822,209, and 5,084,197.
Typical dispersants include borated and non-borated succinimides, including those derivatives from mono-succinimides, bis-succinimides, and/or mixtures of mono- and bis-succinimides, wherein the hydrocarbyl succinimide is derived from a hydrocarbylene group such as polyisobutylene having a Mn of from about 500 to about 5000, or from about 1000 to about 3000, or about 1000 to about 2000, or a mixture of such hydrocarbylene groups, often with high terminal vinylic groups. Other specific dispersants include succinic acid-esters and amides, alkylphenol-polyamine-coupled Mannich adducts, their capped derivatives, and other related components.
Polymethacrylate or polyacrylate derivatives are another class of dispersants. These dispersants are typically prepared by reacting a nitrogen containing monomer and a methacrylic or acrylic acid esters containing 5-25 carbon atoms in the ester group. Representative examples are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,100,993, and 6,323,164. Polymethacrylate and polyacrylate dispersants are normally used as multifunctional viscosity modifiers. The lower molecular weight versions can be used as lubricant dispersants or fuel detergents.
Illustrative dispersants particularly useful in this disclosure include those derived from polyalkenyl-substituted mono- or dicarboxylic acid, anhydride or ester, which dispersant has a polyalkenyl moiety with a number average molecular weight of at least 900 and from greater than 1.3 to 1.7, specifically from greater than 1.3 to 1.6, most specifically from greater than 1.3 to 1.5, functional groups (mono- or dicarboxylic acid producing moieties) per polyalkenyl moiety (a medium functionality dispersant). Functionality (F) can be determined according to the following formula:
<in-line-formulae>F=(SAP×Mn)/((112,200×A.I.)−(SAP×98))</in-line-formulae>
wherein SAP is the saponification number (i.e., the number of milligrams of KOH consumed in the complete neutralization of the acid groups in one gram of the succinic-containing reaction product, as determined according to ASTM D94); Mn is the number average molecular weight of the starting olefin polymer; and A.I. is the percent active ingredient of the succinic-containing reaction product (the remainder being unreacted olefin polymer, succinic anhydride and diluent).
The polyalkenyl moiety of the dispersant may have a number average molecular weight of at least 900, suitably at least 1500, specifically between 1800 and 3000, such as between 2000 and 2800, more specifically from about 2100 to 2500, and most specifically from about 2200 to about 2400. The molecular weight of a dispersant is generally expressed in terms of the molecular weight of the polyalkenyl moiety. This is because the precise molecular weight range of the dispersant depends on numerous parameters including the type of polymer used to derive the dispersant, the number of functional groups, and the type of nucleophilic group employed.
Polymer molecular weight, specifically Mn, can be determined by various known techniques. One convenient method is gel permeation chromatography (GPC), which additionally provides molecular weight distribution information (see W. W. Yau, J. J. Kirkland and D. D. Bly, “Modern Size Exclusion Liquid Chromatography”, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1979). Another useful method for determining molecular weight, particularly for lower molecular weight polymers, is vapor pressure osmometry (e.g., ASTM D3592).
The polyalkenyl moiety in a dispersant typically has a narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD), also referred to as polydispersity, as determined by the ratio of weight average molecular weight (Mw) to number average molecular weight (Mn). Polymers having a Mw/Mn of less than 2.2, specifically less than 2.0, are most desirable. Suitable polymers have a polydispersity of from about 1.5 to 2.1, specifically from about 1.6 to about 1.8.
Suitable polyalkenes employed in the formation of the dispersants include homopolymers, interpolymers or lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. One family of such polymers comprise polymers of ethylene and/or at least one C3 to C2 alpha-olefin having the formula H2C═CHR1 wherein R1 is a straight or branched chain alkyl radical comprising 1 to 26 carbon atoms and wherein the polymer contains carbon-to-carbon unsaturation, and a high degree of terminal ethenylidene unsaturation. Typically, such polymers comprise interpolymers of ethylene and at least one alpha-olefin of the above formula, wherein R1 is alkyl of from 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and more specifically is alkyl of from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and more specifically still of from 1 to 2 carbon atoms.
Another useful class of polymers is polymers prepared by cationic polymerization of monomers such as isobutene and styrene. Common polymers from this class include polyisobutenes obtained by polymerization of a C4 refinery stream having a butene content of 35 to 75% by wt., and an isobutene content of 30 to 60% by wt. A typical source of monomer for making poly-n-butenes is petroleum feedstreams such as Raffinate II. These feedstocks are disclosed in the art such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,739. A specific embodiment utilizes polyisobutylene prepared from a pure isobutylene stream or a Raffinate I stream to prepare reactive isobutylene polymers with terminal vinylidene olefins. Polyisobutene polymers that may be employed are generally based on a polymer chain of from 1500 to 3000.
The dispersant(s) are typically non-polymeric (e.g., mono- or bis-succinimides). Such dispersants can be prepared by conventional processes such as disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/0020950, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
The dispersant(s) can be borated by conventional means, as generally disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,087,936, 3,254,025 and 5,430,105.
Such dispersants may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 20 weight percent or 0.01 to 10 weight percent, specifically about 0.5 to 8 weight percent, or more specifically 0.5 to 6 weight percent. Or such dispersants may be used in an amount of about 2 to 12 weight percent, specifically about 4 to 10 weight percent, or more specifically 6 to 9 weight percent. On an active ingredient basis, such additives may be used in an amount of about 0.06 to 14 weight percent, specifically about 0.3 to 6 weight percent. The hydrocarbon portion of the dispersant atoms can range from C60 to C1000, or from C70 to C300, or from C70 to C200. These dispersants may contain both neutral and basic nitrogen, and mixtures of both. Dispersants can be end-capped by borates and/or cyclic carbonates.
As used herein, the dispersant concentrations are given on an “as delivered” basis. Typically, the active dispersant is delivered with a process oil. The “as delivered” dispersant typically contains from about 20 weight percent to about 80 weight percent, or from about 40 weight percent to about 60 weight percent, of active dispersant in the “as delivered” dispersant product.
Viscosity Modifiers
In certain embodiments of the invention, viscosity modifiers (also known as viscosity index improvers (VI improvers), and viscosity improvers) may also be included in the lubricant compositions of this disclosure.
Viscosity modifiers provide lubricants with high and low temperature operability. These additives impart shear stability at elevated temperatures and acceptable viscosity at low temperatures.
Suitable viscosity modifiers include high molecular weight hydrocarbons, polyesters and viscosity modifier dispersants that function as both a viscosity modifier and a dispersant. Typical molecular weights of these polymers are between about 10,000 to 1,500,000, more typically about 20,000 to 1,200,000, and even more typically between about 50,000 and 1,000,000.
Examples of suitable viscosity modifiers are linear or star-shaped polymers and copolymers of methacrylate, butadiene, olefins, or alkylated styrenes. Polyisobutylene is a commonly used viscosity modifier. Another suitable viscosity modifier is polymethacrylate (copolymers of various chain length alkyl methacrylates, for example), some formulations of which also serve as pour point depressants. Other suitable viscosity modifiers include copolymers of ethylene and propylene, hydrogenated block copolymers of styrene and isoprene, and polyacrylates (copolymers of various chain length acrylates, for example). Specific examples include styrene-isoprene or styrene-butadiene based polymers of 50,000 to 200,000 molecular weight.

Antiwear Additives
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more other antiwear agents. A metal alkylthiophosphate, and more particularly a metal dialkyl dithio phosphate in which the metal constituent is zinc, or zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate (ZDDP), is a useful component of the lubricating oils of this disclosure. ZDDP can be derived from primary alcohols, secondary alcohols or mixtures thereof. ZDDP compounds generally are of the formula:
<in-line-formulae>Zn[SP(S)(OR1)(OR2)]2 </in-line-formulae>
where R1 and R2 are C1-C18 alkyl groups, specifically C2-C12 alkyl groups. These alkyl groups may be straight chain or branched. Alcohols used in the ZDDP can be 2-propanol, butanol, secondary butanol, pentanols, hexanols such as 4-methyl-2-pentanol, n-hexanol, n-octanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, alkylated phenols, and the like. Mixtures of secondary alcohols or of primary and secondary alcohol can be used. Alkyl aryl groups may also be used.
Zinc dithiophosphates which are commercially available include secondary zinc dithiophosphates such as those available from for example, The Lubrizol Corporation under the trade designations “LZ 677A”, “LZ 1095” and “LZ 1371”, from for example Chevron Oronite under the trade designation “OLOA 262” and from for example Afton Chemical under the trade designation “HITEC 7169”.
The ZDDP is typically used in amounts of from about 0.4 weight percent to about 1.2 weight percent, specifically from about 0.5 weight percent to about 1.0 weight percent, and more specifically from about 0.6 weight percent to about 0.8 weight percent, based on the total weight of the lubricating oil composition, although more or less can often be used advantageously. Typically, the ZDDP is a secondary ZDDP and present in an amount of from about 0.6 to 1.0 weight percent of the total weight of the lubricating oil composition.
Low phosphorus engine oil formulations are included in this disclosure. For such formulations, the phosphorus content is typically less than about 0.12 weight percent specifically less than about 0.10 weight percent and most specifically less than about 0.085 weight percent.
Detergents
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more detergents. Illustrative detergents useful in this disclosure include, for example, alkali metal detergents, alkaline earth metal detergents, or mixtures of one or more alkali metal detergents and one or more alkaline earth metal detergents. A typical detergent is an anionic material that contains a long chain hydrophobic portion of the molecule and a smaller anionic or oleophobic hydrophilic portion of the molecule. The anionic portion of the detergent is typically derived from an organic acid such as a sulfur acid, carboxylic acid, phosphorous acid, phenol, or mixtures thereof. The counterion is typically an alkaline earth or alkali metal.
Salts that contain a substantially stochiometric amount of the metal are described as neutral salts and have a total base number (TBN, as measured by ASTM D2896) of from 0 to 80. Many compositions are overbased, containing large amounts of a metal base that is achieved by reacting an excess of a metal compound (a metal hydroxide or oxide, for example) with an acidic gas (such as carbon dioxide). Useful detergents can be neutral, mildly overbased, or highly overbased. These detergents can be used in mixtures of neutral, overbased, highly overbased calcium salicylate, sulfonates, phenates and/or magnesium salicylate, sulfonates, phenates. The TBN ranges can vary from low, medium to high TBN products, including as low as 0 to as high as 600. Mixtures of low, medium, high TBN can be used, along with mixtures of calcium and magnesium metal based detergents, and including sulfonates, phenates, salicylates, and carboxylates. A detergent mixture with a metal ratio of 1, in conjunction of a detergent with a metal ratio of 2, and as high as a detergent with a metal ratio of 5, can be used. Borated detergents can also be used.
Alkaline earth phenates are another useful class of detergent. These detergents can be made by reacting alkaline earth metal hydroxide or oxide (CaO, Ca(OH)2, BaO, Ba(OH)2, MgO, Mg(OH)2, for example) with an alkyl phenol or sulfurized alkylphenol. Useful alkyl groups include straight chain or branched C1-C30 alkyl groups, specifically, C4-C20 or mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable phenols include isobutylphenol, 2-ethylhexylphenol, nonylphenol, dodecyl phenol, and the like. It should be noted that starting alkylphenols may contain more than one alkyl substituent that are each independently straight chain or branched and can be used from 0.5 to 6 weight percent. When a non-sulfurized alkylphenol is used, the sulfurized product may be obtained by methods well known in the art. These methods include heating a mixture of alkylphenol and sulfurizing agent (including elemental sulfur, sulfur halides such as sulfur dichloride, and the like) and then reacting the sulfurized phenol with an alkaline earth metal base.
Metal salts of carboxylic acids are also useful as detergents. These carboxylic acid detergents may be prepared by reacting a basic metal compound with at least one carboxylic acid and removing free water from the reaction product. These compounds may be overbased to produce the desired TBN level. Detergents made from salicylic acid are one useful class of detergents derived from carboxylic acids. Useful salicylates include long chain alkyl salicylates. One useful family of compositions is of the formula
<img> id-US20180037840A1-20180208-C00021.TIF </img>
where Rs is an alkyl group having 1 to about 30 carbon atoms, n is an integer from 1 to 4, and M is an alkaline earth metal. Typical Rs groups are alkyl chains of at least C11, specifically C13 or greater. Rs may be optionally substituted with substituents that do not interfere with the detergent's function. In a specific embodiment, M is calcium, magnesium, or barium. In a more specific embodiment, M is calcium.
Hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylic acids may be prepared from phenols by the Kolbe reaction (see U.S. Pat. No. 3,595,791). The metal salts of the hydrocarbyl-substituted salicylic acids may be prepared by double decomposition of a metal salt in a polar solvent such as water or alcohol.
Alkaline earth metal phosphates are also used as detergents and are known in the art.
Detergents may be simple detergents or what is known as hybrid or complex detergents. The latter detergents can provide the properties of two detergents without the need to blend separate materials. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,039.
Typical detergents include calcium phenates, calcium sulfonates, calcium salicylates, magnesium phenates, magnesium sulfonates, magnesium salicylates and other related components (including borated detergents), and mixtures thereof. Typical mixtures of detergents include magnesium sulfonate and calcium salicylate, magnesium sulfonate and calcium sulfonate, magnesium sulfonate and calcium phenate, calcium phenate and calcium salicylate, calcium phenate and calcium sulfonate, calcium phenate and magnesium salicylate, calcium phenate and magnesium phenate.
The lubricating oils of this disclosure exhibit desired properties, e.g., wear control and fuel efficiency, in the presence or absence of a detergent, in particular, the presence or absence of a salicylate detergent or a sulfonate detergent.
The detergent concentration in the lubricating oils of this disclosure can range from about 0.5 to about 6.0 weight percent, specifically about 0.6 to 5.0 weight percent, and more specifically from about 0.8 weight percent to about 4.0 weight percent, based on the total weight of the lubricating oil composition.
As used herein, the detergent concentrations are given on an “as delivered” basis. Typically, the active detergent is delivered with a process oil. The “as delivered” detergent typically contains from about 20 weight percent to about 100 weight percent, or from about 40 weight percent to about 60 weight percent, of active detergent in the “as delivered” detergent product.
Antioxidants
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more antioxidants. Antioxidants retard the oxidative degradation of base oils during service. Such degradation may result in deposits on metal surfaces, the presence of sludge, or a viscosity increase in the lubricant. One skilled in the art knows a wide variety of oxidation inhibitors that are useful in lubricating oil compositions. See, Klamann in Lubricants and Related Products, op cite, and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,798,684 and 5,084,197, for example.
Useful antioxidants include hindered phenols. These phenolic antioxidants may be ashless (metal-free) phenolic compounds or neutral or basic metal salts of certain phenolic compounds. Typical phenolic antioxidant compounds are the hindered phenolics which are the ones which contain a sterically hindered hydroxyl group, and these include those derivatives of dihydroxy aryl compounds in which the hydroxyl groups are in the o- or p-position to each other. Typical phenolic antioxidants include the hindered phenols substituted with C6+ alkyl groups and the alkylene coupled derivatives of these hindered phenols. Examples of phenolic materials of this type 2-t-butyl-4-heptyl phenol; 2-t-butyl-4-octyl phenol; 2-t-butyl-4-dodecyl phenol; 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-heptyl phenol; 2,6-di-t-butyl-4-dodecyl phenol; 2-methyl-6-t-butyl-4-heptyl phenol; and 2-methyl-6-t-butyl-4-dodecyl phenol. Other useful hindered mono-phenolic antioxidants may include for example hindered 2,6-di-alkyl-phenolic proprionic ester derivatives. Bis-phenolic antioxidants may also be advantageously used in combination with the instant disclosure. Examples of ortho-coupled phenols include: 2,2'-bis(4-heptyl-6-t-butyl-phenol); 2,2'-bis(4-octyl-6-t-butyl-phenol); and 2,2'-bis(4-dodecyl-6-t-butyl-phenol). Para-coupled bisphenols include for example 4,4'-bis(2,6-di-t-butyl phenol) and 4,4'-methylene-bis(2,6-di-t-butyl phenol).
Effective amounts of one or more catalytic antioxidants may also be used. The catalytic antioxidants comprise an effective amount of a) one or more oil soluble polymetal organic compounds; and, effective amounts of b) one or more substituted N,N'-diaryl-o-phenylenediamine compounds or c) one or more hindered phenol compounds; or a combination of both b) and c). Catalytic antioxidants are more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 8,048,833, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.
Non-phenolic oxidation inhibitors which may be used include aromatic amine antioxidants and these may be used either as such or in combination with phenolics. Typical examples of non-phenolic antioxidants include: alkylated and non-alkylated aromatic amines such as aromatic monoamines of the formula R8R9R10N where R8 is an aliphatic, aromatic or substituted aromatic group, R9 is an aromatic or a substituted aromatic group, and R10 is H, alkyl, aryl or R11S(O)XR12 where R11 is an alkylene, alkenylene, or aralkylene group, R12 is a higher alkyl group, or an alkenyl, aryl, or alkaryl group, and x is 0, 1 or 2. The aliphatic group R8 may contain from 1 to about 20 carbon atoms, and in certain embodiments, contains from about 6 to 12 carbon atoms. The aliphatic group is a saturated aliphatic group. In one embodiment, both R8 and R9 are aromatic or substituted aromatic groups, and the aromatic group may be a fused ring aromatic group such as naphthyl. Aromatic groups R8 and R9 may be joined together with other groups such as S.
Typical aromatic amines antioxidants have alkyl substituent groups of at least about 6 carbon atoms. Examples of aliphatic groups include hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, and decyl. Generally, the aliphatic groups will not contain more than about 14 carbon atoms. The general types of amine antioxidants useful in the present compositions include diphenylamines, phenyl naphthylamines, phenothiazines, imidodibenzyls and diphenyl phenylene diamines. Mixtures of two or more aromatic amines are also useful. Polymeric amine antioxidants can also be used. Particular examples of aromatic amine antioxidants useful in the present disclosure include: p,p'-dioctyldiphenylamine; t-octylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine; phenyl-alphanaphthylamine; and p-octylphenyl-alpha-naphthylamine.
Sulfurized alkyl phenols and alkali or alkaline earth metal salts thereof also are useful antioxidants.
Typical antioxidants include hindered phenols, arylamines. These antioxidants may be used individually by type or in combination with one another. Such additives may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 5 weight percent, specifically about 0.01 to 1.5 weight percent, more specifically zero to less than 1.5 weight percent, more specifically zero to less than 1 weight percent.
Pour Point Depressants (PPDs)
Conventional pour point depressants (also known as lube oil flow improvers) may be added to the compositions of the present disclosure if desired. These pour point depressant may be added to lubricating compositions of the present disclosure to lower the minimum temperature at which the fluid will flow or can be poured. Examples of suitable pour point depressants include polymethacrylates, polyacrylates, polyarylamides, condensation products of haloparaffin waxes and aromatic compounds, vinyl carboxylate polymers, and terpolymers of dialkylfumarates, vinyl esters of fatty acids and allyl vinyl ethers. U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,815,022; 2,015,748; 2,191,498; 2,387,501; 2,655, 479; 2,666,746; 2,721,877; 2,721,878; and 3,250,715 describe useful pour point depressants and/or the preparation thereof. Such additives may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 5 weight percent, specifically about 0.01 to 1.5 weight percent.
Seal Compatibility Agents
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more seal compatibility agents. Seal compatibility agents help to swell elastomeric seals by causing a chemical reaction in the fluid or physical change in the elastomer. Suitable seal compatibility agents for lubricating oils include organic phosphates, aromatic esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters (butylbenzyl phthalate, for example), and polybutenyl succinic anhydride. Such additives may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 3 weight percent, specifically about 0.01 to 2 weight percent.
Antifoam Agents
Anti-foam agents may advantageously be added to lubricant compositions. These agents retard the formation of stable foams. Silicones and organic polymers are typical anti-foam agents. For example, polysiloxanes, such as silicon oil or polydimethyl siloxane, provide antifoam properties. Anti-foam agents are commercially available and may be used in conventional minor amounts along with other additives such as demulsifiers; usually the amount of these additives combined is less than 1 weight percent and often less than 0.1 weight percent.
Inhibitors and Antirust Additives
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more inhibitor/antirust additives. Antirust additives (or corrosion inhibitors) are additives that protect lubricated metal surfaces against chemical attack by water or other contaminants. A wide variety of these are commercially available.
One type of antirust additive is a polar compound that wets the metal surface, and in certain embodiments, protects it with a film of oil. Another type of antirust additive absorbs water by incorporating it in a water-in-oil emulsion so that only the oil touches the metal surface. Yet another type of antirust additive chemically adheres to the metal to produce a non-reactive surface. Examples of suitable additives include zinc dithiophosphates, metal phenolates, basic metal sulfonates, fatty acids and amines. Such additives may be used in an amount of about 0.01 to 5 weight percent, specifically about 0.01 to 1.5 weight percent.
Friction Modifiers
In certain embodiments of the invention, the lubricating oil composition further comprises one or more additional friction modifiers. (e.g., a mixture a compound of formula (I) and one or more other friction modifier(s)). As discussed herein, a friction modifier (also known as a friction reducer, or lubricity agent or oiliness agent) is any material or materials that can alter the coefficient of friction of a surface lubricated by any lubricant or fluid containing such material(s) (e.g., base oils, formulated lubricant compositions or functional fluids). As described herein, compounds of formula (I) may thermally degrade step-wise (i.e., a degradation product may function as a friction modifier). Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a friction modifier may be a thermally activated friction modifier.
Illustrative friction modifiers may include, for example, organometallic compounds or materials, or mixtures thereof. Illustrative organometallic friction modifiers useful in the lubricating oil formulations of this disclosure include, for example, molybdenum amine, molybdenum diamine, an organotungstenate, a molybdenum dithiocarbamate, molybdenum dithiophosphates, molybdenum amine complexes, molybdenum carboxylates, and the like, and mixtures thereof.

In addition to glycerol polyols, these can include trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, sorbitan, and the like. These esters can be polyol monocarboxylate esters, polyol dicarboxylate esters, and on occasion polyoltricarboxylate esters. Specific embodiments can be the glycerol mono-oleates, glycerol dioleates, glycerol trioleates, glycerol monostearates, glycerol distearates, and glycerol tristearates and the corresponding glycerol monopalmitates, glycerol dipalmitates, and glycerol tripalmitates, and the respective isostearates, linoleates, and the like. On occasion the glycerol esters can be particularly useful, as well as mixtures containing any of these. Ethoxylated, propoxylated, butoxylated fatty acid esters of polyols, especially using glycerol as underlying polyol, can be particularly useful.
Illustrative fatty alcohol ethers include, for example, stearyl ether, myristyl ether, and the like. Alcohols, including those that have carbon numbers from C3 to C50, can be ethoxylated, propoxylated, or butoxylated to form the corresponding fatty alkyl ethers. The underlying alcohol portion can specifically be stearyl, myristyl, C11-C13 hydrocarbon, oleyl, isosteryl, and the like.
The lubricating oils of this disclosure exhibit desired properties, e.g., wear control, in the presence or absence of additional friction modifiers.
Useful concentrations of friction modifiers may typically range from 0.01 weight percent to 5 weight percent, or about 0.1 weight percent to about 2.5 weight percent, or about 0.1 weight percent to about 1.5 weight percent, or about 0.1 weight percent to about 1 weight percent.

Advantageous concentrations of Mo may range from 25 ppm to 700 ppm or more, and often with a range of 50-200 ppm. Friction modifiers of all types may be used alone or in mixtures with the materials of this disclosure. Often mixtures of two or more friction modifiers, or mixtures of friction modifier(s) with alternate surface active material(s), are also desirable.
When lubricating oil compositions contain one or more of the additives discussed above, the additive(s) are blended into the composition in an amount sufficient for it to perform its intended function. Typical amounts of such additives useful in the present disclosure are shown in Table A below.
It is noted that many of the additives are shipped from the additive manufacturer as a concentrate, containing one or more additives together, with a certain amount of base oil diluents. Accordingly, the weight amounts in Table A below, as well as other amounts mentioned herein, are directed to the amount of active ingredient (that is the non-diluent portion of the ingredient).

EXAMPLES
Motivated by growing environmental concerns regarding climate change and greenhouse emissions, many industries have sought to reduce CO2 emissions. This interest has resulted in increased research efforts to improve energy efficiency, particularly in the petrochemical and automobile industries, as an increase in fuel economy correlates to a decrease in vehicle emissions (Remmert, et al., SAE International Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2013, 6, (3), 677-690). Extensive research has focused on improving fuel economy through the use of friction modifiers (FMs) as both a cost-effective and robust means to curtail vehicle emissions (Tang, Z.; Li, S., Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 2014, 18, (3), 119-139).
FMs are lubricant additives that improve lubricity of base oil friction profiles to enhance fuel economy (Tang, Z.; Li, S., Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 2014, 18, (3), 119-139). These additives are commonly used when boundary and mixed lubrication regimes exist (e.g., engines, gears). Boundary lubrication describes a system in which fluid films are unable to form between metal surfaces resulting in high friction, wear, and energy efficiency losses. These losses in efficiency increase both fuel consumption and emissions (Remmert, et al., SAE International Journal of Fuels and Lubricants 2013, 6, (3), 677-690). Low viscosity lubricants have been shown to improve fuel efficiency through reduced fluid friction, but detrimentally impact both boundary and mixed lubrication regimes. The debits from low viscosity basestocks can be offset through the use of more efficacious FMs (Phillips, et al., SAE Technical Paper 2007-01-4143 2007).
FMs are divided into two classes, organo-molybdenum and organic molecules, the latter receiving considerable attention due to their more environmentally friendly nature (e.g., sulfur-free, ashless) (Tang, Z.; Li, S., Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 2014, 18, (3), 119-139). Organic FMs are typically surface-active molecules, possessing long-chain aliphatic tails with a polar head group (e.g., carboxylic acid, alcohol, amine, and phosphate) that physically adsorb or chemically interact with a metallic surface. Upon interacting with a metal surface, the aliphatic chains can orient themselves to maximize van der Waals interactions between adjacent hydrocarbons. While different modes of action for organic FMs boundary lubrication have been suggested (i.e., thick film model (Allen, C. M.; Drauglis, E., Wear 1969, 14, 363), liquid slip (Hersey, M. D., Journal of American Society of Mechanical Engineers 1933, 55, 561)), the most commonly described mechanism is the monolayer model (FIG. 1). FMs interact with a metal substrate, physically and/or chemically, to provide effective lubricity and prevent direct metal/metal contact. Extensive research has demonstrated that systems with organic FM monolayers have a lower coefficient of friction (COF) and are sufficient to prevent direct metal/metal contact. Research has also established that the extent of friction reduction may be influenced by both the polar head group and aliphatic chain length (Jahanmir, S., Wear 1985, 102, (4), 331; Jahanmir, S.; Beltzer, M., Journal Of Tribology 1986, 108, 109-116). The former impacts the method of interaction (physical vs. chemical) and adsorption strength onto the metal surface, whereas the increasing carbon chain length of the latter improves lubricity through increased cohesive energy between adjacent aliphatic chains.
Although straight-chained fatty acids offer the advantage of being biorenewable (Tang, Z.; Li, S., Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science 2014, 18, (3), 119-139) and their mechanism-of-action has been well-established in boundary film models (Bowden, et al., Nature 1945, 156, 97-101), notable disadvantages hinder their efficacy. Fatty acids such as stearic acid are particularly effective in reducing the COF, but exhibit poor solubility in common synthetic oils. Furthermore, Minami et al. noted that while linear fatty acids are effective in reducing friction in mineral oil, this effect is not consistent in more polar synthetic oils (e.g., polyesters and polyethers) (Minami, I.; Mori, S., Lubrication Science 2007, 19, (2), 127-149). Lastly, while only monolayers are needed to reduce friction, it is necessary to replenish organic FMs as their degradation reduces the friction performance with time. To enhance efficacy, overcome poor solubility, and provide sustained release of organic FMs, thermocleavable esters that undergo a β-ester pyrolysis to generate carboxylic acids were investigated (FIG. 2) (Helgesen, M.; Krebs, F. C., Macromolecules 2010, 43, (3), 1253-1260; Peterson, et al., Macromolecules 2008, 41, 8986-8994), which improved upon traditional FMs.
As described herein, to replenish organic friction modifier stocks in base oil lubricants, tertiary ester derivatives of fatty acid-containing dicarboxylic acids were investigated. Specifically, as described in Examples 1-14 below, a series of fatty acid containing dicarboxylic acids and diesters were synthesized and characterized (see, FIG. 12 showing processes and intermediates for preparing compounds of the invention). A series of fatty acid-containing dicarboxylic acids were first developed based on a tartaric acid backbone and their friction modifying capabilities assessed. Coefficient of friction studies illustrated that friction-modifying capabilities were heavily influenced by polar head group type (i.e., carboxylic acid, ester) and chemical bond to tartaric acid (i.e., ester, ether). Thermogravimetric analysis coupled gasphase Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that fatty acid-containing dicarboxylic acids degraded into their respective fatty acids at elevated temperatures. Controlled release studies were conducted on a compound modified with thermocleavable esters, and showed sustained friction modifying activity through the course of the entire study. These systems are ideal candidates for the controlled delivery of friction modifiers, which can increase engine efficiency and reduce fuel consumption, effectively reducing vehicle emissions.
Materials.
Stearic acid was acquired from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, N.J.) and subsequently recrystallized with dichloromethane (DCM) and ethanol. 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) was purchased from AK Scientific (Union City, Calif.). Diacetyl L-tartaric acid and dibenzyl L-tartrate were obtained from TCI (Portland, Oreg.). Di-tert-butyl L-tartrate was prepared as previously published (Uray, et al., Tetrahedron 1988, 44, (14), 4357-4362). Standard ball and disk specimens for High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR) experiments were purchased from PCS Instruments (London, UK). All other reagents, solvents, and fine chemicals were purchased from Aldrich (Milwaukee, Wis.) and used as received.
1H and 13C NMR and FT-IR Spectroscopies.
Proton (1H) and carbon (13C) nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained with Varian 400 or 500 MHz using deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6) as an internal reference and solvent or deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) with tetramethylsilane as an internal reference. A Thermo Nicolet/Avatar 360 spectrometer was used to obtain Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra. Samples were prepared by either grinding sample (1-3 wt %) with potassium bromide (KBr) and pressing into a disc using an IR pellet die (International Crystal Laboratories, Garfield, N.J.) or solvent casting via dichloromethane (DCM) or chloroform (CHCl3) to acquire a thin film on sodium chloride (NaCl) plates. Each spectrum was an average of 32 scans.
Molecular Weight.
Small molecule molecular weights were analyzed via mass spectrometry (MS). A Finnigan LCQ-DUO running on Xcalibur software and an adjustable atmospheric pressure ionization electrospray ion source (API-ESI Ion Source) was used with a pressure of 0.8×10−5 Torr and 150° C. API temperature. Samples dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (<10 μg/mL) were injected via a glass syringe.
Thermal Properties.
Melting (Tm) temperatures were obtained using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). DSC measurements were conducted on a TA Instrument Q200 and analyzed via TA Instruments Universal Analysis 2000 version 4.5A software. Samples (4-6 mg) were heated under nitrogen atmosphere from ambient to 200° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Thermal stability at 200° C. was determined using Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 TGA system equipped with TAC 7/DX instrument controller and Perkin-Elmer Pyris software for data collection. Samples (5-10 mg) were heated under air (20 mL/min) at 200° C. isothermally for 2 hours and the mass loss was monitored.

After stirring overnight, excess DMF was removed using a rotary evaporator and the resulting white paste dissolved in 200 mL 1:1 ethyl acteate:saturated aquoues NaHCO3. The organic layer was washed 3×100 mL sat. aq. NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, isolated via vacuum filtration and concentration in vacuo. The resulting oil was redissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL) and washed 3×50 mL hexanes. The acetonitrile layer was then concentrated in vacuo to acquire pure dibenzyl malate (DBM). Yield: 6.33 g 90% (clear oil). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.32 (m, 10H), 5.16 (split, 4H), 4.52 (s, 1H), 3.21 (s, 1H), 2.87 (split, 2H).
Stearic acid was then coupled to dibenzyl malate using previously developed methods. In short, Dibenzyl malate (2.00 g, 6.37 mmol), stearic acid (1.99 g, 7.00 mmol), EDCI (1.84 g, 9.55 mmol), and DMAP (856 mg, 7.00 mmol) were dissolved in 20 mL anhydrous DCM under argon. Following Dibenzyl malate consumption, as indicated by TLC (4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate), the reaction was stopped and washed 3×100 mL 10% KHSO4. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, isolated via vacuum filtration, and concentrated in vacuo. Crude DBM18 was then purified via silica gel column chromatography using 4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate eluent to acquire pure product. Yield: 2.68 g, 72% (white powder). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 7.29 (m, 10H), 5.54 (t, 1H), 5.14 (m, 4H), 2.93 (d, 2H), 2.30 (m, 2H), 1.58 (quint, 2H), 1.26 (br, 28H), 0.88 (t, 3H).
Finally, DBM18 was selectively deprotected at its benzyl position. To do so, DBM18 (2.68 g, 4.62 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL, 9:1 anhydrous DCM:methanol and Pd/C (10 wt %) was added. The atmosphere was evacuated and charged with hydrogen. Following DBM18 consumption, as indicated by TLC (4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate eluent), the reaction was filtered through a celite-packed fritted funnel and wash 3×100 mL 95:5 DCM:methanol. The filtrate was then concentrated in vacuo and the resulting pale yellow solid subsequently triturated in 100 mL DCM. Pure 10 was isolated via vacuum filtration and dried under vacuum overnight. Yield: 1.80 g, 67% (white powder). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.57 (t, 1H), 2.95 (d, 2H), 2.31 (m, 2H), 1.56 (quint, 2H), 1.26 (br, 28H), 0.88 (t, 3H).

Synthesis of Compound (11, Mono-Oleic T18)
Compound 11 was synthesized following a three-step approach. First, mono-conjugation of Di-t-butyl tartrate with stearic acid occurred using carbodiimide-coupling. To do so, Di-t-butyl tartrate (2.68 g, 10.2 mmol), EDCI (586 mg, 3.07 mmol), and DMAP (275 mg, 2.25 mmol) were dissolved in 35 mL anhydrous DCM under argon. Stearic acid, dissolved in 12 mL, 5:1 anhydrous DCM:DMF, was added drop-wise over 6 h. After stirring overnight, the reaction was washed 3×50 mL 10% KHSO4. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, isolated via vacuum filtration, and concentrated in vacuo. Silica gel column chromatography with a 9:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate eluent was used to acquire pure mono-stearic di-t-butyl tartrate. Yield: 486 mg, 45% (white powder). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.52 (s, 1H), 4.78 (d, 1H), 3.08 (d, 1H) 2.21 (split m, 2H), 1.52 (quint, 2H), 1.44 (s, 18H), 1.26 (br, 28H), 0.88 (t, 3H).
Oleic acid (270 μL, 0.823 mmol) was then conjugated to mono-stearic di-t-butyl tartrate (400 mg, 0.757 mmol) by dissolving in 20 mL anhydrous DCM under argon in the presence of EDCI (217 mg, 1.14 mmol) and DMAP (102 mg, 0.833 mmol). Upon mono-stearic di-t-butyl tartrate consumption, as indicated by TLC (9:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate), the reaction was washed 3×50 mL 10% KHSO4 and 2×50 mL brine. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, isolated via vacuum filtration, and concentrated in vacuo. Crude product was further purified by silica gel column chromatography using 95:5 hexanes:ethyl acetate eluent to acquire mono-oleic-mono-stearic di-t-butyl tartrate. Yield: 522 mg, 87% (white powder). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.61 (s, 2H), 5.34 (br, 2H), 2.41 (m, 4H), 2.00 (m, 4H), 1.65 (quint, 4H), 1.44 (s, 18H), 1.26 (br, 48H), 0.88 (t, 6H).
Mono-oleic-mono-stearic di-t-butyl tartrate (522 mg, 0.659 mmol) was then dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous DCM and TFA (2.32 mL, 26.34 mmol) added drop-wise over 15 minutes. The reaction was stirred overnight and the following morning concentrated in vacuo to acquire a brown paste. The paste was dissolved in 50 mL acetonitrile and washed 3×50 mL hexanes. The acetonitrile layer was concentrated in vacuo to acquire a beige paste. The beige paste was purified using chilled hexanes (40 mL, −20° C.) and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 3 minutes to acquire pure 11. Yield: 401 mg, 89% (off-white powder). 1H-NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.63 (s, 2H), 5.33 (br, 2H), 2.40 (m, 4H), 2.05 (m, 4H), 1.66 (quint, 4H), 1.26 (br, 48H), 0.88 (t, 6H).

The thermal and friction modifying properties of a compound described herein may be evaluated using techniques which are well known in the art, e.g., using techniques described in Example 14.
Example 14
The thermal and friction modifying properties of the representative compounds were evaluated as described below.
Methods
Thermal Stability.
Thermal stability at 200° C. was determined using Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) system equipped with TAC 7/DX instrument controller and Perkin-Elmer Pyris software for data collection. Samples (5-10 mg) were heated under air (20 mL/min) at 200° C. isothermally for 2 hours and monitoring mass loss.
Coefficient of Friction.
The friction performance of each test oil, containing 1 wt % additive, was evaluated using a High Frequency Reciprocating Rig (HFRR, PCS Instruments, London, UK) under boundary conditions. A reference oil comprising a polyalphaolefin (PAO) blend without additives unless noted otherwise was subjected to identical test conditions to determine the COF in the absence of FMs. The HFRR testing was conducted with an oscillating ball-on-disk with the ball and disk contact immersed in test oil. The ball and disk hardware were purchased from PCS Instruments, London, UK. The ball was an AISI 52100 steel with a typical hardness of 800 Hv. The disk was an AISI 52100 steel with a typical hardness of 200 Hv. Tests were conducted under isothermal conditions at predetermined temperatures (e.g., 100 or 200° C.) for 2 hours. The HFRR parameters were a 400 g load (translates to a peak Hertzian contact pressure of about 1 GPa), 60 Hz reciprocating frequency, and 1.0 mm stroke length. A load cell was utilized to determine friction and film thickness between the ball and disk surfaces was inferred from electrical resistance measurements.
Thermal Decomposition Studies.
Thermogravimetric analysis coupled with FTIR (TGA-FTIR) experiments were conducted using a TA instruments Q5000 with an external TGA Module (TA Instruments, Newcastle, Del.) interfaced with a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer. An adjustable-flow chemical metering pump (0.5 inches water, McMaster-Carr, Robbinsville, N.J.) was used to draw evolved gas through the transferline towards the IR gas cell. All samples (20-30 mg) were heated in a platinum HT pan in a flowing atmosphere of air. Sample scans were heated from 25 to 400° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Isothermal experiments were conducted at predetermined temperatures (i.e., 100, 150, and 200° C.). Sample decomposition temperatures (Td) and mass loss were analyzed via TA Instruments Universal Analysis 2000 version 4.5A software, while the IR spectra of evolved gases were examined using Omnic 8.0 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Walthan, Mass.).
FM Controlled Release.
The controlled release of 5 from 6 was monitored using a controlled release unit (CRU) with a high temperature flow loop. Test oil was pumped repeatedly through a heated zone for a fixed amount of time. Bulk test oil, PAO-containing 1 wt % of 6 held at 130° C., was passed through a block heater at 215° C. at 4 mL/min. Aliquots of the bulk testing oil were removed at predetermined time points and subjected to HFRR analysis for 2 hours at 100° C.
Results
Synthesis and Characterization.
Fatty acid-containing dicarboxylic acids were synthesized to assess the influence of incorporating long-chain aliphatic chains, capable of cohesive interactions between adjacent chains, on dicarboxylic acid motifs. A series of fatty acids (lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic) were conjugated to tartaric acid via either direct conjugation or a two-step method (FIGS. 12A-D). Following previously established methods (Faig, et al., Biomacromolecules 2014, 15, (9), 3328-37), tartaric acid was acylated at the vicinal hydroxyl groups by refluxing neat in alkanoyl chloride (i.e., lauroyl, myristoyl chloride) with ZnCl2 as a catalyst to acquire 1 and 13 in high yield. Owing to the poor reactivity of longer chain alkanoyl chlorides (i.e., palmitoyl and stearoyl chlorides) towards tartaric acid in the aforementioned methodology, 12 and 3 were synthesized from dibenzyl L-tartrate (150). Compound 150 was first esterified with the respective fatty acid (i.e., palmitic or stearic acid) via carbodiimide coupling using EDCI and DMAP to acquire 12 and 3. The esterified derivative was subsequently selectively deprotected via hydrogenolysis using 10 wt % Pd/C to acquire 7 and 5.
Additional 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acid derivatives were synthesized to investigate how structural modifications would influence both thermal stability and friction modifying properties. 2,3-Bis(dodecyl) tartaric acid (2) was synthesized to compare ether vs. ester (1) linkages, as ethers would function as more robust linkages owing to their poor leaving group ability. Thus, di-tert-butyl L-tartrate (152) was first synthesized following previous established methods (Uray, G.; Lindner, W., Tetrahedron 1988, 44, (14), 4357-4362), and subsequently alkylated using Williamson ether synthesis with 1-bromododecane in the presence of sodium hydride (NaH) to acquire di-t-butyl 2, 3-bis(dodecyloxyl) tartrate (153). Di-tert-butyl 2,3-bis(dodecyloxyl) tartrate was then selectively deprotected at the t-butyl ester with TFA to acquire 2 (Zhang, et al., Biomaterials 2016, 84, 230-40).
Literature has suggested improved thermal stability at higher temperatures of esters when comparing carboxylic acids vs. simple ester (i.e., Me-, Et-) derivatives (Moldovneanu, S. C., Pyrolysis of Organic Molecules: Applications to Health and Environmental Issues. 1st ed.; Elsevier: Oxford, U K, 2010; p 744). Two tartrate derivatives, diethyl (4) and di-tert-butyl 2,3-bis(stearoyl) tartrate (6), were also synthesized. The former, diethyl 2,3-bis(stearoyl) tartrate (4), was synthesized using an identical method to the 5 synthesis to elucidate the impact of free carboxylic acids vs. esters on thermal robustness. Since research has demonstrated t-butyl esters to be capable of undergoing β-ester pyrolysis and generating carboxylic acid derivatives, di-tertbutyl 2,3-bis(stearoyl) tartaric acid (6) was investigated as a 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acid (5) delivery vehicle (Helgesen, M.; Krebs, F. C., Macromolecules 2010, 43, (3), 1253-1260; Peterson, et al., Macromolecules 2008, 41, 8986-8994).
Successful synthesis of 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acids (1 and 13) and their precursors (12 and 3) in addition to ether (2), ethyl ester (4), and tertiary ester (6) derivatives was evident from 1H NMR spectroscopy. Using 3 as an example, successful product formation was evident by the downfield shift in the tartaric acid methine peak (5.76 ppm), the splitting of the methylene protons adjacent to stearic acid's carbonyl group (2.28 and 2.13 ppm), in addition to the introduction of fatty acid peaks. Subsequent 3 deprotection was corroborated by the absence of aromatic and benzyl protons in 5, in conjunction with accurate fatty acid: methine peak integration. Ester analogs (4 and 6) were corroborated by the appearance of fatty acid resonances in conjunction with the maintenance of ethyl (4) and tert-butyl (6) esters.
Coefficient of Friction and Thermal Robustness.
The coefficients of friction of 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acids and their derivatives were determined using HFRR with oscillating ball-on-disk under boundary conditions at 100 and 200° C. A series of 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acids (1, 13, 7 and 5) was investigated, owing to their design incorporating two carboxylic acid moieties in close proximity. Research has suggested nearby carboxylic acids can improve friction modifier capabilities, specifically in more polar base stocks, due to enhanced polarity of the head group (Minami, I.; Mori, S., Lubrication Science 2007, 19, (2), 127-149). The enhanced polarity of the head group can help overcome solute-solvent interactions with polar base oils and assist in driving FMs towards metal surfaces. Multiple head groups increase the energetic gain of FM surface adhesion because of multiple favorable attachments to metal. Surface adsorption also increases entropy due to the transfer of multiple solvent molecules at the surface into the bulk solution. Furthermore, two adjacent longchain fatty acids may promote enhanced cohesive energy (van der Waals interactions) between chains when they are close in proximity and chemically conjugated compared to their respective fatty acid (i.e., lauric, myristic, palmitic, or stearic acid) alone.

Initial studies focused on 1, a molecule previously synthesized, and its ether-modified derivative (2). At 100° C., 1 displayed superior performance, possessing an average COF of 0.035, approximately half that of the lauric acid (0.067, Table 1). Compound 2 unexpectedly experienced approximately a doubling in the COF (0.115, Table 1) compared to 1 at 100° C. and was appreciably higher than lauric acid itself. These results suggested that 2 either had poor adsorption onto the steel surface and/or weak cohesive energy between the hydrophobic aliphatic ether chains. When testing at 200° C., 2 exhibited similar results, whereas 1 initially reduced friction followed by a drastic increase in the COF to a level comparable to lauric acid. 1H NMR analysis following HFRR showed 1 to be stable at 100° C. (FIG. 3B), however, at 200° C. structural changes occurred, with 1's methine peak absent (FIG. 3C).
These results led to speculation that 1 could be undergoing decarboxylate elimination, releasing lauric acid in the process, as such decomposition reactions are common at elevated temperatures (Moldovneanu, S. C., Pyrolysis of Organic Molecules: Applications to Health and Environmental Issues. 1st ed.; Elsevier: Oxford, U K, 2010; p 744). To investigate this possibility, thermal stability tests at 200° C. were conducted on 1 and 2. The former compound exhibited weight loss >70% within the first ten minutes, whereas the latter lost ˜20 wt. % within the same time frame. While thermal stability at 200° C. increased when transitioning from ester to ether arms, the onset of decomposition remained largely unchanged. Thus, it was speculated that the tartaric acid backbone with free carboxylic acids initiated the thermal decomposition pathway. Moreover, that the decomposition by-product generated with ether side chains, as oppose to ester side chains, was less volatile, accounting for these for the similar onset of decomposition but difference in mass loss under isothermal conditions.
TGA-FTIR scans were used to investigate the decomposition pathway, by analyzing the evolved gas with increasing temperatures. 1 and 2 TGA-FTIR scans displayed Td values at 183 and 193° C., respectively. Moreover, both compounds possessed Td values above lauric acid, which begins to thermally decompose at 163° C. Further analysis of lauric acid revealed the evolved gas during TGA-FTIR scans to be volatilized lauric acid. Volatilized lauric acid FTIR spectra was dominated by symmetric and asymmetric sp3 C-H stretching modes at 2933 and 2865 cm−1, the C═O carbonyl stretching band at 1778 cm−1, in addition to -OH stretching at 3576 cm−1 (FIG. 4). These features are a signature profile of volatilized fatty acids and consistent with TGA-FTIR spectra of similar molecules (Rudolph, et al., Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects 2012, 397, 16-23; Zhang, et al., Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A 2009, 41, (2), 532-541). This finding was promising as one of the by-products from 1 decarboxylative elimination was anticipated to be lauric acid, which could be confirmed by TGA-FTIR spectroscopy. More importantly, should 1 release lauric acid at elevated temperatures, this compound would offer a two-pronged system in which both the parent compound and decomposition product could effectively lower friction.
While 1's TGA-FTIR scan possessed a two-step mass loss (FIG. 5A), neither correlated to decarboxylative elimination (i.e., weight loss was greater than that associated with carboxylic acid functionalities ˜28 wt. %). The FTIR spectra displayed signature asymmetric stretching and degenerative bending CO2 peaks at 2356 and 666 cm−1, correlating to the expected by-product from decarboxylation. 1's FTIR spectra also contained multiple carbonyl stretches (1777 and 1797 cm−1), broader hydroxyl stretches (3581 cm−1), and a prominent C-O stretch (1183 cm−1) indicating a much more complex degradation pathway than initially anticipated (FIG. 5B). While it possessed carbonyl and hydroxyl stretches, suggesting possible formation of a carboxylic acid, it interestingly lacked aliphatic C-H stretching absorbances. Although the mechanism of thermal decomposition was inconclusive, 1 demonstrated promising friction modifying capabilities resulting in the development of additional derivatives to further explore the decomposition pathway and optimize the FM properties of the system.
To determine whether increasing the carbon chain length of the arms in 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acid would further improve friction modifier capabilities, dicarboxylic acid derivatives with myristic (13), palmitic (7), and stearic acid (5) were evaluated using HFRR. Whereas 13 and 7 were found to possess a similar COF to 1 (0.038±0.002, Table 1) at 100° C., 5 displayed a considerably lower value (0.025, Table 1) than all other 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acids and approximately one-third of stearic acid. The dicarboxylic acid moiety of 5 enabled enhanced surface activity relative to mono-carboxylic acids (i.e., stearic acid), while the longer aliphatic chains of the compound facilitated increased cohesive energy between hydrocarbon chains. Similar to 1, all analogues experienced significant increase in COF at 200° C., presumably due to decomposition.
Consistent with 1 and 2, compounds 13, 7 and 5 all exhibited Td values below 200° C., 185±10° C., suggesting similar degradation pathways. Whereas, 13 and 7 displayed near-identical TGA-FTIR thermograms and gas phase spectra, 5 possessed a distinct, two-step decomposition pathway (FIG. 7). In the first decomposition step, an initial weight loss of ˜13% is evident, correlating to the mass of the tartaric acid backbone. This loss is followed by a prolonged weight loss, accounting for ˜80 wt. %, with residual mass remaining as organic char. As expected, the FTIR spectra of the first decomposition step contained a significant amount of CO2, evident by the large absorbances at 2354 and 664 cm−1 (FIG. 7A). Moreover, peaks at 3850, 1797, 1776, 1386, 1182, and 999 cm−1 were also present. These absorbances are consistent with the initial decomposition step of each 2,3-bis(alkanoyl) tartaric acid (1, 13, 7 and 5), corroborating a similar decomposition pathway. Following the initial decomposition cascade, volatilized stearic acid was evident (FIG. 7B) with asymmetric and symmetric C-H sp3 hybridized stretches at 2932 and 2838 cm−1, the C═O carbonyl stretch at 1778 cm−1, and -O-H gas phase stretch at 3576 cm−1 (Zhang, et al., Metallurgical and Materials Transactions A 2009, 41, (2), 532-541). These findings coupled with the COF above 5's Td, demonstrate that 5 not only possesses friction modifying capabilities, but also decomposes to release stearic acid, an established FM. Consequently, 5 functions as both a potent FM and a delivery vehicle for stearic acid, offering a means to replenish in situ FM quantities.
The difference in decomposition of 5 when compared to shorter chain fatty acid derivatives (1, 13 and 7) is likely due to the higher volatilization temperature of stearic acid. For example, lauric acid volatilizes at 163° C., whereas stearic acid volatilizes at 208° C. This finding coupled with the similar COF results between 5 and stearic acid at 200° C. confirms that 5 does release stearic acid. The consistent Td onset of (1, 13, 7 and 5), regardless of the conjugated fatty acids, suggests that the free carboxylic acid of the tartaric acid backbone is likely the driving force for thermal degradation. Given the enhanced potency of 5 relative to its decomposition product (i.e., stearic acid), thermal stability improvement was sought.
To further test the thermal decomposition hypothesis and enhance small molecule additive thermal robustness, diesters of 5, specifically 3 and 4, were analyzed. 5 and diester derivative Td's decreased in the order of 4>3>5 (227, 215, and 183° C., respectively) with thermal stability following a similar trend. These findings corroborated that the presence of carboxylic acids in the tartrate backbone were responsible for the initial thermal decomposition of compound 5 and its shorter aliphatic-linked derivatives (1, 13 and 7). Moreover, TGA-FTIR analysis of 3 and 4 displayed broad, mono-modal weight losses with distinctly different evolved gases (FIG. 8). While diester derivatives enhanced thermal stability relative to 5, the COF was considerably higher at 100° C. and lacked improvement at 200° C. (Table 1). This effect is may be due to decreased adsorption to the surface owing to the less polar head group of the ester vs. carboxylic acid (Jahanmir, S.; Beltzer, M., Journal Of Tribology 1986, 108, 109-116; Jahanmir, S.; Beltzer, M., et al., Tribology Transactions 1986, 29, 423-430).
More importantly, by esterifying the carboxylic acid head groups it altered the degradation pathway, as stearic acid release was not evident. Thus, it became apparent that dicarboxylic acid head groups were necessary for both superior COF properties and releasing desired decomposition product stearic acid. It was hypothesized that the esterification of the carboxylic acid end groups transitioned the initial thermal decomposition pathway from that of decarboxylative elimination, which would release stearic acid. Moreover, that the benzyl (3) and ethyl (4) esters were too thermally robust to undergo β-ester pyrolysis and subsequently generate carboxylic acid end groups. Thus, it is likely that 3 and 4 thermally decomposed via random bond scission, accounting for the worse COF at 200° C. when compared to 5, as stearic acid would not be released.
Controlled FM Release.
Owing to the superior COF of 5, additional modifications were explored to both improve oil solubility and develop a system capable of delivering FMs in a sustained manner. Previous research indicated that tertiary esters in low bandgap polymers were utilized to improve solubility, and were subsequently cleaved at higher temperatures (Helgesen, M.; Krebs, F. C., Macromolecules 2010, 43, (3), 1253-1260; Peterson, et al., Macromolecules 2008, 41, 8986-8994). Therefore, it was hypothesized that di-t-butyl derivatives of 5 (6) could be used to enhance its oil solubility and release the active in a sustained manner when exposed to higher temperature (e.g., an engine piston).
Initial thermal stability screening revealed decomposition of 6 was occurring in three distinct steps (FIG. 9B), ˜15% weight loss in the first step, followed by ˜11 wt. % in the second step, and lastly, sustained weight loss resulting in residual charring. These results were promising as the weight losses in the first and second steps are closely associated with β-ester pyrolysis of 6, releasing isobutylene, followed by subsequent tartaric acid backbone degradation. Further analysis using TGA-FTIR measurements confirmed that the degradation product isobutylene was generated in the initial sequence, as evident by the asymmetric CH2 stretch at 3085 cm−1 and CH3 symmetric and asymmetric stretches at 2965 and 2944 cm−1 (FIG. 10A). Moreover, the C═C stretch at 1653 cm−1, sp3 hybridized C-H stretch at 1395 cm−1, and CH2 wag at 888 cm−1 are consistent with free isobutylene spectra (Storey, et al., Macromolecules 1998, 31, 1523-1526; Dogu, et al., Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2001, 40, 5044-5051). This finding suggested that 6 was decomposing in a controlled manner to release 5. Following β-ester pyrolysis and ensuing isobutylene release, distinct peaks corresponding to CO2 are apparent, in addition the carbonyl (1797 and 1776 cm−1) and hydroxyl stretches (3850 cm−1) (FIG. 10B). These latter peaks are consistent with the initial decomposition cascade of 5, again confirming β-ester pyrolysis, and subsequent 5 release. The final degradation sequence is the volatilization of stearic acid, as evident by the near-identical spectra to that of free stearic acid (FIG. 10C). These analyses corroborated that 6 delivers 5, which at elevated temperatures releases stearic acid.
Supporting our hypothesis, HFRR data showed improved COF values with increasing temperature. Initially, at 100° C. friction-modifying capabilities similar to diester 3 and 4 occurred, whereas at 200° C., the COF decreased to a value similar to that of 5 under similar conditions. As demonstrated by TGA-FTIR and thermal stability studies, 6 decomposes around 200° C. to release 5, which is unstable at higher temperatures and exhibits a COF similar to stearic acid. The impact of 6 under engine mimicking conditions was then investigated.
Under engine mimicking conditions, the temperature and pressure are not constant, as is the case in HFRR, and 6 would be exposed to a temperature capable of facilitating β-ester pyrolysis for a shorter period of time. To investigate this aspect, 6 was exposed to a home-built Controlled Release Unit (CRU), in which the bulk oil with additive was held at 130° C. and briefly exposed to a block heater, mimicking an engine piston, at 215° C. It was expected that the initial COF would be comparable to that of 6 prior to decomposition, and later time-points to show sustained COF values similar to that of 5 and stearic acid. As expected, the COF was 0.109 at time zero and decreased over the first four hours to a COF of 0.042, indicating 5 release (FIG. 11). After four hours the COF became relatively constant at 0.040±0.005. It is likely that 6 is undergoing β-ester pyrolysis over the first four hours, generating 5, faster than 5 is decomposing into stearic acid. As the bulk temperature of the oil (130° C.) is well below the Td of 5 (183° C.) the active is stable and effectively lowers the friction in engine mimicking conditions. Over time, it is possible that more 5 will be exposed to the high temperature block (215° C.), facilitating 5 decomposition into stearic acid.
In summary, a series of fatty acid-containing diacids based on a tartaric acid backbone, in addition to ether and ester analogues, were successfully synthesized and fully characterized. Ether side chains and diester head groups were found to drastically increase the COF, with the former having minimal impact on thermal stability and the latter greatly enhancing it. 5 was identified as a lead compound, effectively reducing friction and releasing stearic acid upon decomposition. Tertiary ester derivatives of 5 (6) were then investigated as a controlled release system to overcome both solubility issues and replenish FMs in solution. TGA-FTIR data demonstrated that 6 underwent a β-ester pyrolysis to release 5, which at elevated temperature degraded further to release stearic acid, allowing for the sustained release of multiple FMs. HFRR corroborated these findings, showing improved COF at higher temperatures. Additionally, CRU analyses, mimicking engine conditions, showed sustained friction reduction over the course of the study, indicating promise for this technology in improving engine efficiency. This novel delivery method, coupled with the potent friction modification of the molecules described here, offer a means to overcome traditional FM consumption.
