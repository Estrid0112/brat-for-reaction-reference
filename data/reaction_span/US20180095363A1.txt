FIELD
The present invention relates to a photoacid-generating compound useful in photoresists compositions for microlithography.
INTRODUCTION
Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) photolithography utilizes radiation at 13.5 nanometer wavelength to create high-resolution features via chemical reactions in a photoresist layer. However, the EUV light source is typically also includes light at higher wavelengths, such as 193 and 248 nanometers. These contaminating wavelengths, sometimes called out-of-band (OOB) radiation, can be absorbed by the photoresist film and cause unwanted chemical changes that degrade image resolution.
There is therefore a desire for photoresist components, particularly photoacid generators, that are good absorbers of 13.5 nanometer radiation and are chemically sensitive to 13.5 nanometer radiation, while also absorbing OOB radiation and minimizing accompanying chemical sensitivity.

Example 1
This example describes the synthesis of a photoacid-generating (PAG) compound designated PAG A. PAG A was synthesized in two steps as depicted in FIG. 1. The procedure for first step was adapted from the procedure reported by Aoyama et al., Synthesis, 2008, volume 13, pages 2089-2099. Thus, a mixture of 3-chlorobutan-2-one (1, 10.0 grams, 93.3 millimoles), naphthalene-2-thiol (2, 15.0 grams, 93.8 millimoles), 5.0 grams of silica gel supported sodium carbonate (Na2CO3/SiO2, 1.0:5.3 weight/weight) and 5.0 grams of silica gel-supported polyphosphoric acid (PPA/SiO2, 1:9 weight/weight) in 60 milliliters of chlorobenzene was stirred at 120° C. for 16 hours. The silica supported reagents were removed by filtration and the filtrate was evaporated to produce crude product 1,2-dimethylnaphtho[2,1-b]thiophene (3), which was purified by flash column chromatography using CH2Cl2 as a solvent. To the resulting CH2Cl2 solution was added 5.0 g of activated carbon and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. The activated carbon was removed by filtration and the CH2Cl2 was completely removed under reduced pressure to produce the pure product 3.

The mixture was stirred and heated at reflux for 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured slowly into 100 milliliters of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE). The resulting crude product was filtered off and dried. The crude product was dissolved in 100 milliliters of CH2Cl2 and treated with activated carbon. The solution was further washed with deionized water (5×100 milliliters) and the organic phase was concentrated to one-third the initial volume, poured into 300 milliliters methyl t-butyl ether, and the resulting pure PAG A was filtered and dried.

The mixture was stirred and heated at reflux for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and poured slowly into 2.0 liters of methyl t-butyl ether. The resulting crude product was filtered off and dried. The crude product 6 was dissolved in 200 milliliters of CH2Cl2 and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium iodide (8×50 milliliters). The organic phase was separated, the solvent volume reduced to 30 milliliters and the concentrated solution was poured slowly into 2.5 liters of methyl t-butyl ether to precipitate compound 7, which was filtered and dried. The amount of the crude product 7 was 18.6 grams. This product was used in the next step without further purification. Compound 7 (15.0 grams, 32.75 millimoles) and AdOH-TFBS (salt 8, 15.0 grams, 35.20 millimoles) were mixed in 100 milliliters water and 100 milliliters CH2Cl2 and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. The organic phase was washed with deionized water (5×100 mL) and then was concentrated to one-third the initial volume, poured into 1.0 liter methyl t-butyl ether and the resulting pure product PAG B was filtered and dried. Yield 23.4 grams (yield of the last ion exchange reaction was 85%). 1H NMR (acetone-d6) δ: 1.36 (s, 9H), 1.79-1.53 (m, 12H), 2.18 (s, 2H), 2.57 (s, 3H), 2.70 (m, 2H), 3.08 (s, 3H), 4.35 (t, 2H), 7.84 (m, 6H), 8.2 (m, 3H), 9.05 (s, 1H). 19F NMR (acetone-d6) δ: −119.15 (2F, CF2SO3), 112.67 (2F, CH2CF2CF2SO3). Positive liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) traces indicate 98% purity of the cation, and negative LC-MS traces indicate 98% purity of the anion.

The photoresist coating had a target thickness of 60 nanometers. A post-application bake (PAB; also known as soft bake) was conducted at 130° C. for 90 seconds, and a post-exposure bake (PEB) was conducted at a temperature of 100° C. for 60 seconds. The wafers were exposed in a 10×10 E0 array ArF tool (193 nm radiation). The wafers were then developed with 0.26 Normal aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and E0 values were extracted from the contrast curve of each wafer. Similar experiments were performed for an E0 array using an EUV-ES 9000 LTJ tool (EUV radiation, 13.4 nm), and a Canon ES4 KrF tool (248 nm radiation). Table 2 summarizes the clearing doses (E0) at 193 nm, 248 nm, and 13.4 nm radiation for three formulations that are similar except for the PAG additive. The Clearing Dose E0 (mJ/cm2) is defined as the amount of exposure energy required to clear the resist. E0 is determined from the resist contrast curve, which is a plot of the film thickness of resist remaining after exposure and development, as a function of exposure energy. The exposure at which the film clears completely is the clearing dose, E0, expressed in units of millijoules per square-centimeter. The E0 results in Table 2 indicate slower photospeed or lower sensitivity for formulations that contain formulation C compared to the comparative formulations A and B. Furthermore, the ratio of 13.4 nm E0/248 nm E0 is the smallest for formulation C, indicating that PAG C possess the lowest sensitivity at 248 nm radiation. Similarly, the ratio of 13.4 nm E0/193 nm E0 is the smallest for formulation C, indicating that PAG C possess the lowest sensitivity at 193 nm radiation.
These results demonstrate that photoacid generator compound PAG A is less sensitive to deep-ultraviolet out-of-band radiation compared to comparative photoacid generator compounds TPS PFBuS and TBPDBT PFBuS.

Example 4
This example describes evaluation of photoresist compositions formulated for EUV exposure. Table 3 summarizes the components and proportions of photoresist E and comparative photoresist D. In Table 3, “PAG wt %” is the weight percent of photoacid-generating compound, based on the total weight of solids, “wt % PDBT AdCA” is the weight percent of PDBT AdCA, based on the total weight of solids, and “wt % THIPDA” is the weight percent of THIPDA, based on the total weight of solids. In addition to base THIPDA, PAG-containing polymer A3, PAG B, comparative PAG C, and the base PDBT AdCA were used in the two formulations (see FIG. 4 for structures). The percent solids for the two formulations was 2.5% and the solvent was a blend of ethyl lactate/methyl 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, 7:3 weight/weight. Lithographic evaluations at EUV wavelengths were obtained using the AMET tool at the SEMATECH facility in Albany, N.Y., USA. Each photoresist solution was coated onto a silicon wafer that had been pre-coated with an organic bottom anti-reflective coating, at a thickness of 25 nanometers. The photoresist coating had target thickness of 50 nanometers. Post-application bake was conducted at 110° C. for 90 seconds, and post-exposure bake was conducted at 100° C. for 60 seconds. Illumination conditions were: numerical aperture=0.30; Quad; 0.36σ/0.93σ; PhotoMask; Subfield H/V; Cleave LS. Wafers were then developed with 0.26 Normal aqueous TMAH for 30 seconds.

Photolithographic results are summarized in Table 4, where “Esize” is sizing energy expressed in units of millijoules per square-centimeter, “PCM” is pattern collapse margin expressed in units of nanometers, “LWR” is line width roughness expressed in units of nanometers, “Exposure Latitude” is expressed in units of percent and is defined as a difference in exposure energy to print +/−10% of the target diameter normalized by the sizing energy, and Focus Latitude (FL) is the range of focus that keeps the linewidth within 10% of the critical dimension (CD). The results in Table 4 show that Photoresist E, comprising the photoacid-generating compound of this invention, demonstrates resolution of features as small as 26 nanometer half pitch (hp) line/space at an acceptable photospeed, good pattern collapse margin and exposure latitude, as well as acceptable LWR. The inventive example also shows a clear focus latitude advantage.
