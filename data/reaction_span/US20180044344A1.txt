FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to compounds of Formulae (I) to (VII), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and salts, and to the uses thereof. The compounds, salts and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating or ameliorating abnormal cell proliferative disorders, such as cancer.
BACKGROUND
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are important cellular enzymes that perform essential functions in regulating eukaryotic cell division and proliferation. The cyclin-dependent kinase catalytic units are activated by regulatory subunits known as cyclins. At least sixteen mammalian cyclins have been identified (Johnson D G, Walker C L. Cyclins and Cell Cycle Checkpoints. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. (1999) 39:295-312). Cyclin B/CDK1, cyclin A/CDK2, cyclin E/CDK2, cyclin D/CDK4, cyclin D/CDK6, and likely other heterodynes are important regulators of cell cycle progression. Additional functions of cyclin/CDK heterodynes include regulation of transcription, DNA repair, differentiation and apoptosis (Morgan D O. Cyclin-dependent kinases: engines, clocks, and microprocessors. Annu. Rev. Cell. Dev. Biol. (1997) 13:261-291). Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors have been demonstrated to be useful in treating cancer. Increased activity or temporally abnormal activation of cyclin-dependent kinases has been shown to result in the development of human tumors, and human tumor development is commonly associated with alterations in either the CDK proteins themselves or their regulators (Cordon-Cardo C. Mutations of cell cycle regulators: biological and clinical implications for human neoplasia. Am. J. Pathol. (1995) 147:545-560; Karp J E, Broder S. Molecular foundations of cancer: new targets for intervention. Nat. Med. (1995) 1:309-320; Hall M, Peters G. Genetic alterations of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and Cdk inhibitors in human cancer. Adv. Cancer Res. (1996) 68:67-108). Amplifications of the regulatory subunits of CDKs and cyclins, and mutation, gene deletion, or transcriptional silencing of endogenous CDK inhibitors have also been reported (Smalley et al. Identification of a novel subgroup of melanomas with KIT/cyclin-dependent kinase-4 overexpression. Cancer Res (2008) 68: 5743-52).
Clinical trials for the CDK4/6 inhibitors palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib are ongoing for breast and other cancers, as single agents or in combination with other therapeutics. Palbociclib and ribociclib have been approved for treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with aromatase inhibitors in post-menopausal women, and for palbociclib, in combination with fulvestrant after disease progression following endocrine therapy, (O'Leary et al. Treating cancer with selective CDK4/6 inhbitors. Nature Reviews (2016) 13:417-430). While CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown significant clinical efficacy in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer, as with other kinases their effects may be limited over time by the development of primary or acquired resistance.
Overexpression of CDK2 is associated with abnormal regulation of cell-cycle. The cyclin E/CDK2 complex plays and important role in regulation of the G1/S transition, histone biosynthesis and centrosome duplication. Progressive phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin D/Cdk4/6 and cyclin E/Cdk2 releases the G1 transcription factor, E2F, and promotes S-phase entry. Activation of cyclin A/CDK2 during early S-phase promotes phosphorylation of endogenous substrates that permit DNA replication and inactivation of E2F, for S-phase completion. (Asghar et al. The history and future of targeting cyclin-dependent kinases in cancer therapy, Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2015; 14(2): 130-146).
Cyclin E, the regulatory cyclin for CDK2, is frequently overexpressed in cancer. Cyclin E amplification or overexpression has long been associated with poor outcomes in breast cancer. (Keyomarsi et al., Cyclin E and survival in patients with breast cancer. N Engl J Med. (2002) 347:1566-75). Cyclin E2 (CCNE2) overexpression is associated with endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells and CDK2 inhibition has been reported to restore sensitivity to tamoxifen or CDK4 inhibitors in tamoxifen-resistant and CCNE2 overexpressing cells. (Caldon et al., Cyclin E2 overexpression is associated with endocrine resistance but not insensitivity to CDK2 inhibition in human breast cancer cells. Mol Cancer Ther. (2012) 11:1488-99; Herrera-Abreu et al., Early Adaptation and Acquired Resistance to CDK4/6 Inhibition in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer, Cancer Res. (2016) 76: 2301-2313). Cyclin E amplification also reportedly contributes to trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer. (Scaltriti et al. Cyclin E amplification/overexpression is a mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients, Proc Natl Acad Sci. (2011) 108: 3761-6). Cyclin E overexpression has also been reported to play a role in basal-like and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as inflammatory breast cancer. (Elsawaf & Sinn, Triple Negative Breast Cancer: Clinical and Histological Correlations, Breast Care (2011) 6:273-278; Alexander et al., Cyclin E overexpression as a biomarker for combination treatment strategies in inflammatory breast cancer, Oncotarget (2017) 8: 14897-14911.)
Amplification or overexpression of cyclin E1 (CCNE1) is also associated with poor outcomes in ovarian, gastric, endometrial and other cancers. (Nakayama et al., Gene amplification CCNE1 is related to poor survival and potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer, Cancer (2010) 116: 2621-34; Etemadmoghadam et al., Resistance to CDK2 Inhibitors Is Associated with Selection of Polyploid Cells in CCNE1-Amplified Ovarian Cancer, Clin Cancer Res (2013) 19: 5960-71; Au-Yeung et al., Selective Targeting of Cyclin E1-Amplified High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 and AKT Inhibition, Clin. Cancer Res. (2017) 23:1862-1874; Ayhan et al., CCNE1 copy-number gain and overexpression identify ovarian clear cell carcinoma with a poor prognosis, Modern Pathology (2017) 30: 297-303; Ooi et al., Gene amplification of CCNE1, CCND1, and CDK6 in gastric cancers detected by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and fluorescence in situ hybridization, Hum Pathol. (2017) 61: 58-67; Noske et al., Detection of CCNE1/URI (19q12) amplification by in situ hybridisation is common in high grade and type II endometrial cancer, Oncotarget (2017) 8: 14794-14805).
The small molecule inhibitor, dinaciclib (MK-7965) inhibits CDK1, CDK2, CDK5 and CDK9 and is currently in clinical development for breast and hematological cancers. Seliciclib (roscovitine or CYC202), which inhibits CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9, is being investigated for treatment of advanced solid tumors in conjunction with chemotherapy.
Despite significant efforts, there are no approved agents targeting CDK2 to date. Cicenas et al. Highlights of the Latest Advances in Research on CDK Inhibitors. Cancers, (2014) 6:2224-2242. There remains a need to discover CDK inhibitors having novel activity profiles, in particular those targeting CDK2.

More specifically, fluorinated alkyl groups may be specifically referred to as fluoroalkyl groups, e.g., C1-C6, C1-C4 or C1-C2 fluoroalkyl groups, which are typically substituted by 1, 2 or 3 fluoro atoms. Thus, a C1-C4 fluoroalkyl includes trifluoromethyl (-CF3), difluoromethyl (-CF2H), fluoromethyl (-CFH2), difluoroethyl (-CH2CF2H), and the like.
Similarly, “hydroxyalkyl” refers to an alkyl group having the specified number of carbon atoms that is substituted by one or more hydroxy substituents, and typically contain 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms, and 1, 2 or 3 hydroxy (i.e., “C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl”). Thus, C1-C6 hydroxyalkyl includes hydroxymethyl (-CH2OH) and 2-hydroxyethyl (-CH2CH2OH).
“Alkoxyalkyl” refers to an alkyl group having the specified number of carbon atoms that is substituted by one or more alkoxy substituents. Alkoxyalkyl groups typically contain 1-6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion and are substituted by 1, 2 or 3 C1-C4 alkyoxy substituents.

“Aminoalkyl” refers to alkyl group having the specified number of carbon atoms that is substituted by one or more substituted or unsubstituted amino groups, as such groups are further defined herein. Aminoalkyl groups typically contain 1-6 carbon atoms in the alkyl portion and are substituted by 1, 2 or 3 amino substituents.

Representative examples include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, 1-, 2-, or 3-butenyl, and the like. Alkenyl groups are unsubstituted or substituted by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl.

“Alkylene” as used herein refers to a divalent hydrocarbyl group having the specified number of carbon atoms which can link two other groups together. Sometimes it refers to a group -(CH2)t- where t is 1-8, and preferably t is 1-4. Where specified, an alkylene can also be substituted by other groups and may include one or more degrees of unsaturation (i.e., an alkenylene or alkynlene moiety) or rings. The open valences of an alkylene need not be at opposite ends of the chain. Thus branched alkylene groups such as -CH(Me)-, -CH2CH(Me)- and -C(Me)2- are also included within the scope of the term ‘alkylenes’, as are cyclic groups such as cyclopropan-1,1-diyl and unsaturated groups such as ethylene (-CH═CH-) or propylene (-CH2-CH═CH-). Where an alkylene group is described as optionally substituted, the substituents include those typically present on alkyl groups as described herein.
“Heteroalkylene” refers to an alkylene group as described above, wherein one or more non-contiguous carbon atoms of the alkylene chain are replaced by -N(R)-, -O- or -S(O)x-, where R is H or a suitable substituent group (e.g., R6) and x is 0-2. For example, the group -O-(CH2)1-4- is a ‘C2-C5’-heteroalkylene group, where one of the carbon atoms of the corresponding alkylene is replaced by O.
“Alkoxy” refers to a monovalent -O-alkyl group, wherein the alkyl portion has the specified number of carbon atoms. Alkoxy groups typically contain 1 to 8 carbon atoms (“C1-C8 alkoxy”), or 1 to 6 carbon atoms (“C1-C6 alkoxy”), or 1 to 4 carbon atoms (“C1-C4 alkoxy”). For example, C1-C4 alkoxy includes methoxy, ethoxy, isopropoxy, tert-butyloxy (i.e., -OCH3, -OCH2CH3, -OCH(CH3)2, -OC(CH3)3), and the like. Alkoxy groups are unsubstituted or substituted on the alkyl portion by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl. In particular, alkoxy groups may be optionally substituted by one or more halo atoms, and in particular one or more fluoro atoms, up to the total number of hydrogen atoms present on the alkyl portion. Such groups are referred to as “haloalkoxy” (or, where fluorinated, more specifically as “fluoroalkoxy”) groups having the specified number of carbon atoms and substituted by one or more halo substituents, Typically such groups contain from 1-6 carbon atoms, preferably 1-4 carbon atoms, and sometimes 1-2 carbon atoms, and 1, 2 or 3 halo atoms (i.e., “C1-C6 haloalkoxy”, “C1-C4 haloalkoxy” or “C1-C2 haloalkoxy”). More specifically, fluorinated alkyl groups may be specifically referred to as fluoroalkoxy groups, e.g., C1-C6, C1-C4 or C1-C2 fluoroalkoxy groups, which are typically substituted by 1, 2 or 3 fluoro atoms. Thus, a C1-C4 fluoroalkoxy includes trifluoromethyloxy (-OCF3), difluoromethyloxy (-OCF2H), fluoromethyloxy (-OCFH2), difluoroethyloxy (-OCH2CF2H), and the like.
Similarly, “thioalkoxy” refers to a monovalent -S-alkyl group, wherein the alkyl portion has the specified number of carbon atoms, and is optionally substituted on the alkyl portion by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl. For example, a C1-C4 thioalkoxy includes -SCH3 and -SCH2CH3.
“Cycloalkyl” refers to a non-aromatic, saturated or partially unsaturated carbocyclic ring system containing the specified number of carbon atoms, which may be a monocyclic, spirocyclic, bridged or fused bicyclic or polycyclic ring system that is connected to the base molecule through a carbon atom of the cycloalkyl ring. Typically, the cycloalkyl groups of the invention contain 3 to 12 carbon atoms (“C3-C12 cycloalkyl”), preferably 3 to 8 carbon atoms (“C3-C8 cycloalkyl”). Representative examples include, e.g., cyclopropane, cyclobutane, cyclopentane, cyclopentene, cyclohexane, cyclohexene, cyclohexadiene, cycloheptane, cycloheptatriene, adamantane, and the like. Cycloalkyl groups are unsubstituted or substituted by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl.

“Cycloalkylalkyl” is used to describe a cycloalkyl ring, typically a C3-C8 cycloalkyl, which is connected to the base molecule through an alkylene linker, typically a C1-C4 alkylene. Cycloalkylalkyl groups are sometimes described by the total number of carbon atoms in the carbocyclic ring and linker, and typically contain from 4-12 carbon atoms (“C4-C12 cycloalkylalkyl”). Thus a cyclopropylmethyl group is a C4-cycloalkylalkyl group and a cyclohexylethyl is a C8-cycloalkylalkyl. Cycloalkylalkyl groups are unsubstituted or substituted on the cycloalkyl and/or alkylene portions by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl groups. Sometimes cycloalkylalkyl groups are described herein, as -L-C3-C8-cycloalkyl, where the cycloalkyl group has the number of carbon atoms indicated and -L-refers to an alkylene linker. It will be understood that when -L-is a bond, the group is cycloalkyl.
The terms “heterocyclyl”, “heterocyclic” or “heteroalicyclic” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a non-aromatic, saturated or partially unsaturated ring system containing the specified number of ring atoms, including at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S as a ring member, where ring S atoms are optionally substituted by one or two oxo groups (i.e., S(O)x, where x is 0, 1 or 2) and where the heterocyclic ring is connected to the base molecule via a ring atom, which may be C or N. Heterocyclic rings include rings which are spirocyclic, bridged, or fused to one or more other heterocyclic or carbocyclic rings, where such spirocyclic, bridged, or fused rings may themselves be saturated, partially unsaturated or aromatic to the extent unsaturation or aromaticity makes chemical sense, provided the point of attachment to the base molecule is an atom of the heterocyclic portion of the ring system. Preferably, heterocyclic rings contain 1 to 4 heteroatoms selected from N, O, and S(O)q as ring members, and more preferably 1 to 2 ring heteroatoms, provided that such heterocyclic rings do not contain two contiguous oxygen atoms. Heterocyclyl groups are unsubstituted or substituted by suitable substituent groups, for example the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl. Such substituents may be present on the heterocyclic ring attached to the base molecule, or on a spirocyclic, bridged or fused ring attached thereto. In addition, ring N atoms are optionally substituted by groups suitable for an amine, e.g., alkyl, acyl, carbamoyl, sulfonyl substituents, and the like.
Heterocycles typically include 3-12 membered heterocyclyl groups, preferably 3-10 membered heterocyclyl groups, and more preferably 5-6 membered heterocyclyl groups, in accordance with the definition herein.
Illustrative examples of saturated heterocycles include, but are not limited to:

Illustrative examples o bridged, use and spiro heterocycles include, but are not limited to:
<img> id-US20180044344A1-20180215-C00006.TIF </img>
In frequent embodiments, heterocyclic groups contain 3-12 ring members, including both carbon and non-carbon heteroatoms, and preferably 4-7 ring members.
In certain preferred embodiments, substituent groups comprising 3-12 membered heterocycles are selected from azetidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, azepanyl, diazepanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiophenyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, morpholinyl and thiomorpholinyl rings, each of which are optionally substituted as described for the particular substituent group, to the extent such substitution makes chemical sense.
It is understood that no more than two N, O or S atoms are ordinarily connected sequentially, except where an oxo group is attached to N or S to form a nitro or sulfonyl group, or in the case of certain heteroaromatic rings, such as triazine, triazole, tetrazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, and the like.
The term “heterocyclylalkyl” may be used to describe a heterocyclic group of the specified size that is connected to the base molecule through an alkylene linker of the specified length. Typically, such groups contain an optionally substituted 3-12 membered heterocycle attached to the base molecule through a C1-C4 alkylene linker.
Where so indicated, such groups are optionally substituted on the alkylene portion by the same groups that are described herein as suitable for alkyl groups and on the heterocyclic portion by groups described as suitable for heterocyclic rings. Sometimes heterocyclylalkyl groups are described herein as -L-heterocyclylalkyl, where the heterocyclylalkyl group has the number of ring atoms indicated and -L-refers to an alkylene linker. It will be understood that when -L-is a bond, the group is heterocyclyl.
“Aryl” or “aromatic” refer to an optionally substituted monocyclic or fused bicyclic or polycyclic ring system having the well-known characteristics of aromaticity, wherein at least one ring contains a completely conjugated pi-electron system. Typically, aryl groups contain 6 to 20 carbon atoms (“C6-C20 aryl”) as ring members, preferably 6 to 14 carbon atoms (“C6-C14 aryl”) or more preferably, 6 to 12 carbon atoms (“C6-C12 aryl”). Fused aryl groups may include an aryl ring (e.g., a phenyl ring) fused to another aryl or heteroaryl ring, or fused to a saturated or partially unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, provided the point of attachment to the base molecule on such fused ring systems is an atom of the aromatic portion of the ring system. Examples, without limitation, of aryl groups include phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, indanyl, indenyl, and tetrahydronaphthyl. The aryl group is unsubstituted or substituted as further described herein.
Similarly, “heteroaryl” or “heteroaromatic” refer to monocyclic or fused bicyclic or polycyclic ring systems having the well-known characteristics of aromaticity that contain the specified number of ring atoms and include at least one heteroatom selected from N, O and S as a ring member in an aromatic ring. The inclusion of a heteroatom permits aromaticity in 5-membered rings as well as 6-membered rings. Typically, heteroaryl groups contain 5 to 20 ring atoms (“5-20 membered heteroaryl”), preferably 5 to 14 ring atoms (“5-14 membered heteroaryl”), and more preferably 5 to 12 ring atoms (“5-12 membered heteroaryl”). Heteroaryl rings are attached to the base molecule via a ring atom of the heteroaromatic ring, such that aromaticity is maintained. Thus, 6-membered heteroaryl rings may be attached to the base molecule via a ring C atom, while 5-membered heteroaryl rings may be attached to the base molecule via a ring C or N atom. Heteroaryl groups may also be fused to another aryl or heteroaryl ring, or fused to a saturated or partially unsaturated carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, provided the point of attachment to the base molecule on such fused ring systems is an atom of the heteroaromatic portion of the ring system. Examples of unsubstituted heteroaryl groups often include, but are not limited to, pyrrole, furan, thiophene, pyrazole, imidazole, isoxazole, oxazole, isothiazole, thiazole, triazole, oxadiazole, thiadiazole, tetrazole, pyridine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, pyrazine, benzofuran, benzothiophene, indole, benzimidazole, indazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, purine, triazine, naphthryidine and carbazole. In frequent preferred embodiments, 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl groups are selected from the group consisting of pyrrolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxazolyl, isothiazolyl, thiazolyl, triazolyl, pyridinyl and pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl or pyridazinyl rings. The heteroaryl group is unsubstituted or substituted as further described herein.
Aryl, heteroaryl and heterocyclyl moieties described herein as optionally substituted may be substituted by one or more substituent groups, which are selected independently unless otherwise indicated. The total number of substituent groups may equal the total number of hydrogen atoms on the aryl, heteroaryl or heterocyclyl moiety, to the extent such substitution makes chemical sense and aromaticity is maintained in the case of aryl and heteroaryl rings. Optionally substituted aryl, heteroaryl or heterocyclyl groups typically contain from 1 to 5 optional substituents, sometimes 1 to 4 optional substituents, preferably 1 to 3 optional substituents, or more preferably from 1-2 optional substituents.
Optional substituent groups suitable for aryl, heteroaryl and heterocyclyl rings include, but are not limited to: C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, 3-12 membered heterocyclyl, C6-C12 aryl and 5-12 membered heteroaryl; and halo, ═O, -CN, -C(O)Rx, -CO2Rx, -C(O)NRxRy, -SRx, -SORx, -SO2Rx, -SO2NRxRy, -NO2, -NRxRy, -NRxC(O)Ry, -NRxC(O)NRxRy, -NRxC(O)ORx, -NRxSO2Ry, -NRxSO2NRxRy, -ORx, -OC(O)Rx and -OC(O)NRxRy; where each Rx and Ry is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, 3-12 membered heterocyclyl, C6-C12 aryl, or 5-12 membered heteroaryl, or Rx and Ry may be taken together with the N atom to which they are attached to form a 3-12 membered heterocyclyl or 5-12 membered heteroaryl, each optionally containing 1, 2 or 3 additional heteroatoms selected from O, N and S(O)q where q is 0-2; each Rx and Ry is optionally substituted with 1 to 3 substituents independently selected from the group consisting of halo, ═O, ═S, ═N-CN, ═N-OR', ═NR', -CN, -C(O)R', -CO2R', -C(O)NR'2, -SR', -SOR', -SO2R', -SO2NR'2, -NO2, -NR'2, -NR'C(O)R', -NR'C(O)NR'2, -NR'C(O)OR', -NR'SO2R', -NR'SO2NR'2, -OR', -OC(O)R' and -OC(O)NR'2, wherein each R' is independently H, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 acyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, 3-12 membered heterocyclyl, C6-C12 aryl, or 5-12 membered heteroaryl; and each said C1-C8 alkyl, C2-C8 alkenyl, C2-C8 alkynyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, 3-12 membered heterocyclyl, C6-C12 aryl and 5-12 membered heteroaryl is optionally substituted as further defined herein.

Illustrative examples of fused ring heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to:

An “arylalkyl” group refers to an aryl group as described herein which is linked to the base molecule through an alkylene or similar linker. Arylalkyl groups are described by the total number of carbon atoms in the ring and linker. Thus a benzyl group is a C7-arylalkyl group and a phenylethyl is a C8-arylalkyl. Typically, arylalkyl groups contain 7-16 carbon atoms (“C7-C16 arylalkyl”), wherein the aryl portion contains 6-12 carbon atoms and the alkylene portion contains 1-4 carbon atoms. Such groups may also be represented as -C1-C4 alkylene-C6-C12 aryl.
“Heteroarylalkyl” refers to a heteroaryl group as described above that is attached to the base molecule through an alkylene linker, and differs from “arylalkyl” in that at least one ring atom of the aromatic moiety is a heteroatom selected from N, O and S.
Heteroarylalkyl groups are sometimes described herein according to the total number of non-hydrogen atoms (i.e., C, N, S and O atoms) in the ring and linker combined, excluding substituent groups. Thus, for example, pyridinylmethyl may be referred to as a “C7”-heteroarylalkyl. Typically, unsubstituted heteroarylalkyl groups contain 6-20 non-hydrogen atoms (including C, N, S and O atoms), wherein the heteroaryl portion typically contains 5-12 atoms and the alkylene portion typically contains 1-4 carbon atoms. Such groups may also be represented as -C1-C4 alkylene-5-12 membered heteroaryl. Sometimes heteroarylalkyl groups are described herein as -L-heteroarylalkyl, where the heteroarylalkyl group has the number of ring atoms indicated and -L-refers to an alkylene linker. It will be understood that when -L-is a bond, the group is heteroaryl.
Similarly, “arylalkoxy” and “heteroarylalkoxy” refer to aryl and heteroaryl groups, attached to the base molecule through a heteroalkylene linker (i.e., -O-alkylene-), wherein the groups are described according to the total number of non-hydrogen atoms (i.e., C, N, S and O atoms) in the ring and linker combined. Thus, -O-CH2-phenyl and -O-CH2-pyridinyl groups would be referred to as C8-arylalkoxy and C8-heteroarylalkoxy groups, respectively.
Where an arylalkyl, arylalkoxy, heteroarylalkyl or heteroarylalkoxy group is described as optionally substituted, the substituents may be on either the divalent linker portion or on the aryl or heteroaryl portion of the group. The substituents optionally present on the alkylene or heteroalkylene portion are the same as those described above for alkyl or alkoxy groups generally, while the substituents optionally present on the aryl or heteroaryl portion are the same as those described above for aryl or heteroaryl groups generally.
“Hydroxy” refers to an -OH group.
“Acyloxy” refers to a monovalent group -OC(O)alkyl, wherein the alkyl portion has the specified number of carbon atoms (typically C1-C8, preferably C1-C6 or C1-C4) that are optionally substituted by groups suitable for alkyl. Thus, C1-C4 acyloxy includes an -OC(O)C1-C4 alkyl substituent, e.g., -OC(O)CH3.
“Acyl” refers to a monovalent group -C(O)alkyl, wherein the alkyl portion has the specified number of carbon atoms (typically C1-C8, preferably C1-C6 or C1-C4) and may be optionally substituted by groups suitable for alkyl, e.g., by F, OH or alkoxy. Thus, optionally substituted -C(O)C1-C4 alkyl includes unsubstituted acyl groups, such as -C(O)CH3 (i.e., acetyl) and -C(O)CH2CH3 (i.e., propionyl), as well as substituted acyl groups such as -C(O)CF3 (trifluoroacetyl), -C(O)CH2OH (hydroxyacetyl), -C(O)CH2OCH3 (methoxyacetyl), -C(O)CF2H (difluoroacetyl), and the like.
“Acylamino” refers to a monovalent group, -NHC(O)alkyl or -NRC(O)alkyl, wherein the alkyl portion has the specified number of carbon atoms (typically C1-C8, preferably C1-C6 or C1-C4) and is optionally substituted by groups suitable for alkyl. Thus, C1-C4 acylamino includes an -NHC(O)C1-C4 alkyl substituent, e.g., -NHC(O)CH3.
“Aryloxy” or “heteroaryloxy” refer to optionally substituted -O-aryl or -O-heteroaryl, in each case where aryl and heteroaryl are as further defined herein.
“Arylamino” or “heteroarylamino” refer to optionally substituted -NH-aryl, -NR-aryl, -NH-heteroaryl or -NR-heteroaryl, in each case where aryl and heteroaryl are as further defined herein and R represents a substituent suitable for an amine, e.g., an alkyl, acyl, carbamoyl or sulfonyl group, or the like.
“Cyano” refers to a -C≡N group.
“Unsubstituted amino” refers to a group -NH2. Where the amino is described as substituted or optionally substituted, the term includes groups of the form -NRxRy, where each or Rx and Ry is independently H, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, acyl, thioacyl, aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl, in each case having the specified number of atoms and optionally substituted as described herein. For example, “alkylamino” refers to a group -NRxRy, wherein one of Rx and Ry is an alkyl moiety and the other is H, and “dialkylamino” refers to -NRxRy wherein both of Rx and Ry are alkyl moieties, where the alkyl moieties having the specified number of carbon atoms (e.g., -NH-C1-C4 alkyl or -N(C1-C4 alkyl)2). Typically, alkyl substituents on amines contain 1 to 8 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or more preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The term also includes forms wherein Rx and Ry are taken together with the N atom to which they are attached to form a 3-12 membered heterocyclyl or 5-12 membered heteroaryl ring, each of which may itself be optionally substituted as described herein for heterocyclyl or heteroaryl rings, and which may contain 1 to 3 additional heteroatoms selected from N, O and S(O)x where x is 0-2 as ring members, provided that such rings do not contain two contiguous oxygen atoms.
“Halogen” or “halo” refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo (F, Cl, Br, I). Preferably, halo refers to fluoro or chloro (F or Cl).
“Optional” or “optionally” means that the subsequently described event or circumstance may but need not occur, and the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not.
The terms “optionally substituted” and “substituted or unsubstituted” are used interchangeably to indicate that the particular group being described may have no non-hydrogen substituents (i.e., unsubstituted), or the group may have one or more non-hydrogen substituents (i.e., substituted). If not otherwise specified, the total number of substituents that may be present is equal to the number of H atoms present on the unsubstituted form of the group being described. Where an optional substituent is attached via a double bond, such as an oxo (═O) substituent, the group occupies two available valences, so the total number of other substituents that are included is reduced by two. In the case where optional substituents are selected independently from a list of alternatives, the selected groups are the same or different. Throughout the disclosure, it will be understood that the number and nature of optional substituent groups will be limited to the extent that such substitutions make chemical sense.

Unless indicated otherwise, all references herein to the inventive compounds include references to salts, solvates, hydrates and complexes thereof, and to solvates, hydrates and complexes of salts thereof, including polymorphs, stereoisomers, and isotopically labelled versions thereof.
Compounds of the invention may exist in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts such as, e.g., acid addition salts and base addition salts of the compounds of one of the formulae provided herein. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the parent compound. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s)”, as used herein, unless otherwise indicated, includes salts of acidic or basic groups which may be present in the compounds of the formulae disclosed herein.
For example, the compounds of the invention that are basic in nature are capable of forming a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Although such salts must be pharmaceutically acceptable for administration to animals, it is often desirable in practice to initially isolate the compound of the present invention from the reaction mixture as a pharmaceutically unacceptable salt and then simply convert the latter back to the free base compound by treatment with an alkaline reagent and subsequently convert the latter free base to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The acid addition salts of the base compounds of this invention can be prepared by treating the base compound with a substantially equivalent amount of the selected mineral or organic acid in an aqueous solvent medium or in a suitable organic solvent, such as methanol or ethanol. Upon evaporation of the solvent, the desired solid salt is obtained. The desired acid salt can also be precipitated from a solution of the free base in an organic solvent by adding an appropriate mineral or organic acid to the solution.
The acids that may be used to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of such basic compounds of those that form non-toxic acid addition salts, i.e., salts containing pharmacologically acceptable anions, such as the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucuronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate [i.e., 1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] salts.
Examples of salts include, but are not limited to, acetate, acrylate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate (such as chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, and methoxybenzoate), bicarbonate, bisulfate, bisulfite, bitartrate, borate, bromide, butyne-1,4-dioate, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, caproate, caprylate, clavulanate, citrate, decanoate, dihydrochloride, dihydrogenphosphate, edetate, edislyate, estolate, esylate, ethylsuccinate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollate, glycollylarsanilate, heptanoate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, γ-hydroxybutyrate, iodide, isobutyrate, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, metaphosphate, methane-sulfonate, methylsulfate, monohydrogenphosphate, mucate, napsylate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, phenylacetates, phenylbutyrate, phenylpropionate, phthalate, phospate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, propanesulfonate, propionate, propiolate, pyrophosphate, pyrosulfate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, suberate, succinate, sulfate, sulfonate, sulfite, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodode and valerate salts.
Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as glycine and arginine, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and cyclic amines, such as piperidine, morpholine and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum and lithium.
The compounds of the invention that include a basic moiety, such as an amino group, may form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with various amino acids, in addition to the acids mentioned above.
Those compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are capable of forming base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations. Examples of such salts include the alkali metal or alkaline-earth metal salts and particularly, the sodium and potassium salts. These salts are all prepared by conventional techniques.
The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of this invention are those which form non-toxic base salts with the acidic compounds herein. These salts may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide or alkaline earth metal hydroxide, or the like. These salts can also be prepared by treating the corresponding acidic compounds with an aqueous solution containing the desired pharmacologically acceptable cations, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. Alternatively, they may also be prepared by mixing lower alkanolic solutions of the acidic compounds and the desired alkali metal alkoxide together, and then evaporating the resulting solution to dryness in the same manner as before. In either case, stoichiometric quantities of reagents are preferably employed in order to ensure completeness of reaction and maximum yields of the desired final product.
The chemical bases that may be used as reagents to prepare pharmaceutically acceptable base salts of the compounds of the invention that are acidic in nature are those that form non-toxic base salts with such compounds. Such non-toxic base salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from such pharmacologically acceptable cations such as alkali metal cations (e.g., potassium and sodium) and alkaline earth metal cations (e.g., calcium and magnesium), ammonium or water-soluble amine addition salts such as N-methylglucamine-(meglumine), and the lower alkanolammonium and other base salts of pharmaceutically acceptable organic amines.
Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.
For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth (Wiley-VCH, 2002). Methods for making pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of the invention are known to one of skill in the art.
Salts of the present invention can be prepared according to methods known to those of skill in the art. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the inventive compounds can be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of the compound and the desired acid or base, as appropriate. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the salt may vary from completely ionized to almost non-ionized.
It will be understood by those of skill in the art that the compounds of the invention in free base form having a basic functionality may be converted to the acid addition salts by treating with a stoichiometric excess of the appropriate acid. The acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention may be reconverted to the corresponding free base by treating with a stoichiometric excess of a suitable base, such as potassium carbonate or sodium hydroxide, typically in the presence of aqueous solvent, and at a temperature of between about 0° C. and 100° C. The free base form may be isolated by conventional means, such as extraction with an organic solvent. In addition, acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention may be interchanged by taking advantage of differential solubilities of the salts, volatilities or acidities of the acids, or by treating with the appropriately loaded ion exchange resin. For example, the interchange may be affected by the reaction of a salt of the compounds of the invention with a slight stoichiometric excess of an acid of a lower pK than the acid component of the starting salt. This conversion is typically carried out at a temperature between about 0° C. and the boiling point of the solvent being used as the medium for the procedure. Similar exchanges are possible with base addition salts, typically via the intermediacy of the free base form.
The compounds of the invention may exist in both unsolvated and solvated forms. When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm. The term ‘solvate’ is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term ‘hydrate’ is employed when the solvent is water. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in accordance with the invention include hydrates and solvates wherein the solvent of crystallization may be isotopically substituted, e.g. D2O, d6-acetone, d6-DMSO.
Also included within the scope of the invention are complexes such as clathrates, drug-host inclusion complexes wherein, in contrast to the aforementioned solvates, the drug and host are present in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. Also included are complexes of the drug containing two or more organic and/or inorganic components which may be in stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts. The resulting complexes may be ionized, partially ionized, or non-ionized. For a review of such complexes, see J Pharm Sci, 64 (8), 1269-1288 by Haleblian (August 1975), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The invention also relates to prodrugs of the compounds of the formulae provided herein. Thus, certain derivatives of compounds of the invention which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered to a patient, be converted into the inventive compounds, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as ‘prodrugs’. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in ‘Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T Higuchi and W Stella) and ‘Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design’, Pergamon Press, 1987 (ed. E B Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association), the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the inventive compounds with certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as ‘pro-moieties’ as described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs” by H Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Some non-limiting examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include:
(i) where the compound contains a carboxylic acid functionality (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C8)alkyl;
(ii) where the compound contains an alcohol functionality (-OH), an ether thereof, for example, replacement of the hydrogen with (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl, or with a phosphate ether group; and
(iii) where the compound contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R≠H), an amide thereof, for example, replacement of one or both hydrogens with a suitably metabolically labile group, such as an amide, carbamate, urea, phosphonate, sulfonate, etc.
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.
Finally, certain inventive compounds may themselves act as prodrugs of other of the inventive compounds.
Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of the formulae described herein, i.e., compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug.
The compounds of the formulae provided herein may have asymmetric carbon atoms. The carbon-carbon bonds of the compounds of the invention may be depicted herein using a solid line (-), a solid wedge (<img> id-US20180044344A1-20180215-P00001.TIF </img>), or a dotted wedge (<img> id-US20180044344A1-20180215-P00002.TIF </img>). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g. specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of the invention may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included and the attached stereocenter. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of the invention can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of the invention and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.), or a dotted wedge (). The use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers (e.g. specific enantiomers, racemic mixtures, etc.) at that carbon atom are included. The use of either a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that only the stereoisomer shown is meant to be included. It is possible that compounds of the invention may contain more than one asymmetric carbon atom. In those compounds, the use of a solid line to depict bonds to asymmetric carbon atoms is meant to indicate that all possible stereoisomers are meant to be included and the attached stereocenter. For example, unless stated otherwise, it is intended that the compounds of the invention can exist as enantiomers and diastereomers or as racemates and mixtures thereof. The use of a solid line to depict bonds to one or more asymmetric carbon atoms in a compound of the invention and the use of a solid or dotted wedge to depict bonds to other asymmetric carbon atoms in the same compound is meant to indicate that a mixture of diastereomers is present.
Compounds of the invention that have chiral centers may exist as stereoisomers, such as racemates, enantiomers, or diastereomers.
Stereoisomers of the compounds of the formulae herein can include cis and trans isomers, optical isomers such as (R) and (S) enantiomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers, rotational isomers, atropisomers, conformational isomers, and tautomers of the compounds of the invention, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism; and mixtures thereof (such as racemates and diastereomeric pairs).
Also included are acid addition or base addition salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or I-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or dl-arginine.
When any racemate crystallizes, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.
The compounds of the invention may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism and structural isomerism. For example, the compounds may exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol and imine form, and the keto and enamine form and geometric isomers and mixtures thereof. All such tautomeric forms are included within the scope of compounds of the invention. Tautomers exist as mixtures of a tautomeric set in solution. In solid form, usually one tautomer predominates. Even though one tautomer may be described, the present invention includes all tautomers of the compounds of the formulae provided.
In addition, some of the compounds of the invention may form atropisomers (e.g., substituted biaryls). Atropisomers are conformational stereoisomers which occur when rotation about a single bond in the molecule is prevented, or greatly slowed, as a result of steric interactions with other parts of the molecule and the substituents at both ends of the single bond are unsymmetrical. The interconversion of atropisomers is slow enough to allow separation and isolation under predetermined conditions. The energy barrier to thermal racemization may be determined by the steric hindrance to free rotation of one or more bonds forming a chiral axis.
Where a compound of the invention contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cis/trans (or Z/E) isomers are possible. Cis/trans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization.
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) or superfluid critical chromatography (SFC).
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound contains an acidic or basic moiety, an acid or base such as tartaric acid or 1-phenylethylamine. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to one skilled in the art.
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% isopropanol, typically from 2 to 20%, and from 0 to 5% of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.
Stereoisomeric conglomerates may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art; see, for example, “Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds” by E L Eliel (Wiley, New York, 1994), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The enantiomeric purity of compounds described herein may be described in terms of enantiomeric excess (ee), which indicates the degree to which a sample contains one enantiomer in greater amounts than the other. A racemic mixture has an ee of 0%, while a single completely pure enantiomer has an ee of 100%. Similarly, diastereomeric purity may be described in terms of diasteriomeric excess (de).
The present invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in one of the formulae provided, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature.
Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed.
Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, fluorine and chlorine, such as, but not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention may generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting an isotopically-labeled reagent for a non-isotopically-labeled reagent.
Compounds of the invention intended for pharmaceutical use may be administered as crystalline or amorphous products, or mixtures thereof. They may be obtained, for example, as solid plugs, powders, or films by methods such as precipitation, crystallization, freeze drying, spray drying, or evaporative drying. Microwave or radio frequency drying may be used for this purpose.

Dosage Forms and Regimens
Administration of the compounds of the invention may be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration.
Dosage regimens may be adjusted to provide the optimum desired response. For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form, as used herein, refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the chemotherapeutic agent and the particular therapeutic or prophylactic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.
Thus, the skilled artisan would appreciate, based upon the disclosure provided herein, that the dose and dosing regimen is adjusted in accordance with methods well-known in the therapeutic arts. That is, the maximum tolerable dose can be readily established, and the effective amount providing a detectable therapeutic benefit to a patient may also be determined, as can the temporal requirements for administering each agent to provide a detectable therapeutic benefit to the patient. Accordingly, while certain dose and administration regimens are exemplified herein, these examples in no way limit the dose and administration regimen that may be provided to a patient in practicing the present invention.
It is to be noted that dosage values may vary with the type and severity of the condition to be alleviated, and may include single or multiple doses. It is to be further understood that for any particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that dosage ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed composition. For example, doses may be adjusted based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic parameters, which may include clinical effects such as toxic effects and/or laboratory values. Thus, the present invention encompasses intra-patient dose-escalation as determined by the skilled artisan. Determining appropriate dosages and regimens for administration of the chemotherapeutic agent are well-known in the relevant art and would be understood to be encompassed by the skilled artisan once provided the teachings disclosed herein.
The amount of the compound of the invention administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.1 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.
Formulations and Routes of Administration
As used herein, a “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier or diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound.
The pharmaceutical acceptable carrier may comprise any conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. The choice of carrier and/or excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the carrier or excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents (such as hydrates and solvates). The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Non-limiting examples of materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof.
The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository.
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms may be suitably buffered, if desired.
The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages.
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for the delivery of compounds of the invention and methods for their preparation will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Such compositions and methods for their preparation can be found, for example, in ‘Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences’, 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The compounds of the invention may be administered orally. Oral administration may involve swallowing, so that the compound enters the gastrointestinal tract, or buccal or sublingual administration may be employed by which the compound enters the blood stream directly from the mouth.
Formulations suitable for oral administration include solid formulations such as tablets, capsules containing particulates, liquids, or powders, lozenges (including liquid-filled), chews, multi- and nano-particulates, gels, solid solution, liposome, films (including muco-adhesive), ovules, sprays and liquid formulations.
Liquid formulations include suspensions, solutions, syrups and elixirs. Such formulations may be used as fillers in soft or hard capsules and typically include a carrier, for example, water, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, methylcellulose, or a suitable oil, and one or more emulsifying agents and/or suspending agents. Liquid formulations may also be prepared by the reconstitution of a solid, for example, from a sachet.
The compounds of the invention may also be used in fast-dissolving, fast-disintegrating dosage forms such as those described in Expert Opinion in Therapeutic Patents, 11 (6), 981-986 by Liang and Chen (2001), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
For tablet dosage forms, depending on dose, the drug may make up from 1 wt % to 80 wt % of the dosage form, more typically from 5 wt % to 60 wt % of the dosage form. In addition to the drug, tablets generally contain a disintegrant. Examples of disintegrants include sodium starch glycolate, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polyvinylpyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, lower alkyl-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, starch, pregelatinized starch and sodium alginate. Generally, the disintegrant will comprise from 1 wt % to 25 wt %, preferably from 5 wt % to 20 wt % of the dosage form.
Binders are generally used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet formulation. Suitable binders include microcrystalline cellulose, gelatin, sugars, polyethylene glycol, natural and synthetic gums, polyvinylpyrrolidone, pregelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Tablets may also contain diluents, such as lactose (monohydrate, spray-dried monohydrate, anhydrous and the like), mannitol, xylitol, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, microcrystalline cellulose, starch and dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate.
Tablets may also optionally include surface active agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and polysorbate 80, and glidants such as silicon dioxide and talc. When present, surface active agents are typically in amounts of from 0.2 wt % to 5 wt % of the tablet, and glidants typically from 0.2 wt % to 1 wt % of the tablet.
Tablets also generally contain lubricants such as magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, sodium stearyl fumarate, and mixtures of magnesium stearate with sodium lauryl sulphate. Lubricants generally are present in amounts from 0.25 wt % to 10 wt %, preferably from 0.5 wt % to 3 wt % of the tablet.
Other conventional ingredients include anti-oxidants, colorants, flavoring agents, preservatives and taste-masking agents.
Exemplary tablets contain up to about 80 wt % drug, from about 10 wt % to about 90 wt % binder, from about 0 wt % to about 85 wt % diluent, from about 2 wt % to about 10 wt % disintegrant, and from about 0.25 wt % to about 10 wt % lubricant.
Tablet blends may be compressed directly or by roller to form tablets. Tablet blends or portions of blends may alternatively be wet-, dry-, or melt-granulated, melt congealed, or extruded before tableting. The final formulation may include one or more layers and may be coated or uncoated; or encapsulated.
The formulation of tablets is discussed in detail in “Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets, Vol. 1”, by H. Lieberman and L. Lachman, Marcel Dekker, N.Y., N.Y., 1980 (ISBN 0-8247-6918-X), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Solid formulations for oral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.
Suitable modified release formulations are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,864. Details of other suitable release technologies such as high energy dispersions and osmotic and coated particles can be found in Verma et al, Pharmaceutical Technology On-line, 25(2), 1-14 (2001). The use of chewing gum to achieve controlled release is described in WO 00/35298. The disclosures of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
Parenteral Administration
The compounds of the invention may also be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable means for parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intraventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intramuscular and subcutaneous. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include needle (including micro needle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.
Parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water.
The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilization, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art.
The solubility of compounds of the invention used in the preparation of parenteral solutions may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.
Formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release. Thus compounds of the invention may be formulated as a solid, semi-solid, or thixotropic liquid for administration as an implanted depot providing modified release of the active compound. Examples of such formulations include drug-coated stents and PGLA microspheres.
The compounds of the invention may also be administered topically to the skin or mucosa, that is, dermally or transdermally. Typical formulations for this purpose include gels, hydrogels, lotions, solutions, creams, ointments, dusting powders, dressings, foams, films, skin patches, wafers, implants, sponges, fibers, bandages and microemulsions. Liposomes may also be used. Typical carriers include alcohol, water, mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, glycerin, polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol. Penetration enhancers may be incorporated; see, for example, J Pharm Sci, 88 (10), 955-958 by Finnin and Morgan (October 1999). Other means of topical administration include delivery by electroporation, iontophoresis, phonophoresis, sonophoresis and micro needle or needle-free (e.g. Powderject™, Bioject™, etc.) injection. The disclosures of these references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
Formulations for topical administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.
The compounds of the invention can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation, typically in the form of a dry powder (either alone, as a mixture, for example, in a dry blend with lactose, or as a mixed component particle, for example, mixed with phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine) from a dry powder inhaler or as an aerosol spray from a pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer (preferably an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist), or nebulizer, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane. For intranasal use, the powder may include a bioadhesive agent, for example, chitosan or cyclodextrin.
The pressurized container, pump, spray, atomizer, or nebulizer contains a solution or suspension of the compound(s) of the invention comprising, for example, ethanol, aqueous ethanol, or a suitable alternative agent for dispersing, solubilizing, or extending release of the active, a propellant(s) as solvent and an optional surfactant, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, or an oligolactic acid.
Prior to use in a dry powder or suspension formulation, the drug product is micronized to a size suitable for delivery by inhalation (typically less than 5 microns).
This may be achieved by any appropriate comminuting method, such as spiral jet milling, fluid bed jet milling, supercritical fluid processing to form nanoparticles, high pressure homogenization, or spray drying.
Capsules (made, for example, from gelatin or HPMC), blisters and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of the compound of the invention, a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch and a performance modifier such as I-leucine, mannitol, or magnesium stearate. The lactose may be anhydrous or in the form of the monohydrate, preferably the latter. Other suitable excipients include dextran, glucose, maltose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose, sucrose and trehalose.
A suitable solution formulation for use in an atomizer using electrohydrodynamics to produce a fine mist may contain from 1 μg to 20 mg of the compound of the invention per actuation and the actuation volume may vary from 1 μL to 100 μL. A typical formulation includes a compound of the invention, propylene glycol, sterile water, ethanol and sodium chloride. Alternative solvents which may be used instead of propylene glycol include glycerol and polyethylene glycol.
Suitable flavors, such as menthol and levomenthol, or sweeteners, such as saccharin or saccharin sodium, may be added to those formulations of the invention intended for inhaled/intranasal administration.
Formulations for inhaled/intranasal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release using, for example, poly(DL-lactic-coglycolic acid (PGLA). Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.
In the case of dry powder inhalers and aerosols, the dosage unit is determined by means of a valve which delivers a metered amount. Units in accordance with the invention are typically arranged to administer a metered dose or “puff” containing a desired mount of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, as divided doses throughout the day.
Compounds of the invention may be administered rectally or vaginally, for example, in the form of a suppository, pessary, or enema. Cocoa butter is a traditional suppository base, but various alternatives may be used as appropriate.
Formulations for rectal/vaginal administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted and programmed release.
Compounds of the invention may also be administered directly to the eye or ear, typically in the form of drops of a micronized suspension or solution in isotonic, pH-adjusted, sterile saline. Other formulations suitable for ocular and aural administration include ointments, biodegradable (e.g. absorbable gel sponges, collagen) and non-biodegradable (e.g. silicone) implants, wafers, lenses and particulate or vesicular systems, such as niosomes or liposomes. A polymer such as crossed-linked polyacrylic acid, polyvinylalcohol, hyaluronic acid, a cellulosic polymer, for example, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, or methyl cellulose, or a heteropolysaccharide polymer, for example, gelan gum, may be incorporated together with a preservative, such as benzalkonium chloride. Such formulations may also be delivered by iontophoresis.
Formulations for ocular/aural administration may be formulated to be immediate and/or modified release. Modified release formulations include delayed-, sustained-, pulsed-, controlled-, targeted, or programmed release.
Other Technologies
Compounds of the invention may be combined with soluble macromolecular entities, such as cyclodextrin and suitable derivatives thereof or polyethylene glycol-containing polymers, in order to improve their solubility, dissolution rate, taste-masking, bioavailability and/or stability for use in any of the aforementioned modes of administration.
Drug-cyclodextrin complexes, for example, are found to be generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. Both inclusion and non-inclusion complexes may be used. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug, the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, i.e. as a carrier, diluent, or solubilizer. Most commonly used for these purposes are alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins, examples of which may be found in PCT Publication Nos. WO 91/11172, WO 94/02518 and WO 98/55148, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
Dosage
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 mg/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.
Kit-of-Parts
Inasmuch as it may desirable to administer a combination of active compounds, for example, for the purpose of treating a particular disease or condition, it is within the scope of the present invention that two or more pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound in accordance with the invention, may conveniently be combined in the form of a kit suitable for coadministration of the compositions. Thus the kit of the invention includes two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a compound of the invention, and means for separately retaining said compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet.
An example of such a kit is the familiar blister pack used for the packaging of tablets, capsules and the like.
The kit of the invention is particularly suitable for administering different dosage forms, for example, oral and parenteral, for administering the separate compositions at different dosage intervals, or for titrating the separate compositions against one another. To assist compliance, the kit typically includes directions for administration and may be provided with a memory aid.

Sodium hydroxide (287 g, 7.16 mol) and benzyl chloroformate (587 g, 3.44 mol) were added dropwise. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 h, then extracted with DCM (1000 mL×3). The combined organic layers were washed with sat. aq NaCl (500 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 10-33% EtOAc in petroleum ether), to give a yellow solid (550 g, 77% pure by NMR). This solid was washed by petroleum ether/EtOAc (3000 mL/100 mL) and petroleum ether/MTBE (2000 mL/500 mL) to give (±)-benzyl [(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]carbamate (1a, 239 g, 28%, 90% pure by NMR) as a pale yellow solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ=7.37 (t, J=3.9 Hz, 5H), 5.16-4.95 (m, 3H), 4.44 (s, 1H), 3.81-3.68 (m, 1H), 2.15-1.99 (m, 1H), 1.59 (br s, 4H), 1.45-1.31 (m, 1H), 1.19-1.11 (m, 3H).

A 150 mL sealable flask was charged with water (50.9 mL) and benzylamine (10.9 g, 11.1 mL, 102 mmol), then purged with nitrogen for 5 min, before 1-methyl-6-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexane (CAS#16240-42-9, 10 g, 102 mmol) was added. The flask was sealed and heated at 100° C. for 18 h, at which time a biphasic mixture was observed. After cooling to room temperature the flask was further cooled in an ice-water bath. Concentrated aqueous HCl (˜12 M, 13 mL) was added to bring the pH to 1. The organic impurities were extracted with EtOAc (150 mL) and set aside. The acidic aqueous layer was cooled in an ice-water bath and adjusted to pH 10 using 5N aq NaOH. The resulting biphasic mixture was extracted with EtOAc (250 mL×3). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to a brown oil. The remaining benzylamine was evaporated under higher vacuum (˜5 mmHg) at 80° C. for several h, until 1HNMR of a sample showed only ˜20 mole % benzylamine remaining. The residual oil was triturated with heptane (100 mL), causing white crystals to form. The crystals were collected by filtration and dried to give (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2a, 13 g, 62%) as a white crystalline solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ=7.36-7.31 (m, 4H), 7.28-7.23 (m, 1H), 3.91-3.85 (m, 1H), 3.79-3.74 (m, 1H), 2.86 (dd, J=7.8, 8.5 Hz, 1H), 2.12-2.03 (m, 1H), 1.75-1.53 (m, 5H), 1.37-1.27 (m, 1H), 1.22 (s, 3H).
A magnetically-stirred solution of (±)-(1R*,2R*)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2a, 100 g, 487 mmol) and EtOH (700 mL) in a 1 L flask was heated in an 80° C. oil bath for 30 min. A separate 5 L, three-neck flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, internal thermometer, and water-cooled condenser was charged with (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)ethanoic acid (CAS#74927-72-3, 84.1 g, 244 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and EtOH (1.4 L). This flask was also heated in an 80° C. oil bath with stirring until the solid dissolved, ˜15 min, and stirring continued for another 30 min. The hot solution of amine 2a from the first flask was poured via funnel, in a steady flow over 1 min, into the hot, mechanically stirred solution of chiral acid in the second flask. The transfer was quantitated with EtOH (10 mL). The reaction mixture remained clear for about 1 min, then precipitation began. After 5 min, a thick white suspension had formed, but did not hinder mechanical stirring. Stirring was continued at 80° C. for 4 h, then heating was discontinued and the mixture was stirred while gradually cooling to room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOH (350 mL), and dried in a vacuum oven (10 mmHg, 40° C.) for 1.5 days, affording (1R,2R)-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentanaminium (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)acetate (2b-RR, 110.22 g, 82%) as a white solid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ=9.64 (d, J=7.0 Hz, 1H), 9.09 (d, J=2.1 Hz, 2H), 8.96 (t, J=2.1 Hz, 1H), 7.55-7.48 (m, 2H), 7.43-7.23 (m, 8H), 5.47 (d, J=7.1 Hz, 1H), 4.02-3.75 (m, 2H), 2.86 (t, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 2.03-1.87 (m, 1H), 1.66-1.48 (m, 4H), 1.48-1.32 (m, 1H), 1.17 (s, 3H).

The chiral salt (1R,2R)-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentanaminium (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)acetate (2b-RR, 110.22 g, 200.2 mmol) was suspended in water (500 mL) and EtOAc (700 mL) in a 2 L separatory funnel. Aqueous HCl (4 M, 200 mL, 800 mmol) was added and the mixture agitated for ˜30 seconds. A clear biphasic mixture was obtained. The layers were separated, and the organic layer was further washed with aqueous HCl (0.2 M, 125 mL×2). The acidic aqueous layers were combined, split into two portions, and each portion cooled in an ice-water bath. Aqueous NaOH (4 N, 150 mL, 600 mmol) was added to each portion to bring the pH to 10. A white suspension formed at this pH. The two portions were combined, diluted with sat. aq NaCl (150 mL), and extracted with EtOAc (250 mL×4). The combined organic extracts were dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated to give (1R,2R)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2b-00, 41.4 g, 100%, 96% ee). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ=7.36-7.25 (m, 4H), 7.24-7.16 (m, 1H), 4.23 (s, 1H), 3.78-3.65 (m, 2H), 2.70 (t, J=7.5 Hz, 1H), 1.86 (dt, J=3.9, 7.8 Hz, 1H), 1.73 (br s, 1H), 1.62-1.44 (m, 4H), 1.35-1.23 (m, 1H), 1.12 (s, 3H).

A gradient to 50% modifier in 3 min was added to elute any remaining counter ions. The detection was APCI(+)MS monitored from 100-800 Da with single ion monitoring (SIM) at 206 Da. The product peak had a retention time of 1.81 min. Optical rotation of a sample made by this method gave [α]D22 −42.6 (c 1.0, MeOH).

A separate 2 L, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, internal thermometer and water-cooled condenser was charged with (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)ethanoic acid (CAS#74927-72-3, 67 g, 194 mmol, 0.97 equiv; since amine was -96% ee) and EtOH (1.3 L). This flask was stirred and heated at 80° C. (internal) until the solid dissolved (˜15 min) then for 30 min more. The hot amine solution was added to the hot acid solution through a funnel in a steady flow (less than 1 min), and the transfer quantitated with EtOH (10 mL). Precipitation began in about 1 min, and by 5 min a thick white suspension had formed, though stirring was not hindered. Stirring was continued at 80° C. for 4 h, then heating was discontinued and the reaction stirred and allowed to gradually cool to room temperature overnight. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with EtOH (350 mL) and dried (10 mmHg, 40° C.) for 1.5 days to give (1R,2R)-N-benzyl-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentanaminium (2S)-[(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)amino](phenyl)acetate (2b-RR, 106 g, 99%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ=9.66 (d, J=7.0 Hz, 1H), 9.09 (d, J=2.1 Hz, 2H), 8.96 (t, J=2.1 Hz, 1H), 7.55-7.46 (m, 2H), 7.44-7.22 (m, 8H), 5.48 (d, J=7.1 Hz, 1H), 4.63 (br s, 1H), 3.96-3.79 (m, 2H), 3.66-2.97 (m, 2H), 2.84 (t, J=7.9 Hz, 1H), 2.00-1.85 (m, 1H), 1.64-1.48 (m, 4H), 1.45-1.32 (m, 1H), 1.16 (s, 3H).

A solution of (1R,2R)-2-(benzylamino)-1-methylcyclopentanol (2b-00, 38.5 g, 188 mmol, 98% ee) in 2-propanol (1300 mL) was added. The transfer was quantitated with 2-propanol (30 mL). The solution was purged with hydrogen gas for ˜2 min, and then stirred at room temperature under a hydrogen atmosphere (three balloons) for 16 h. The balloons were replenished with hydrogen and stirring continued at room temperature for 6 h, at which time 1H NMR of an aliquot indicated the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was purged with nitrogen, and the catalyst removed by filtration through a Celite® cake. The flask and filter cake were washed with 2-propanol (500 mL). A small aliquot of the combined filtrate was evaporated for analysis. The remainder of the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure (˜10 mmHg, 20° C.) to about 350 mL, and the crude (1R,2R)-2-amino-1-methylcyclopentanol (2c) used directly in the next step without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ=3.03 (t, J=7.4 Hz, 1H), 2.19-2.01 (m, 1H), 1.83-1.58 (m, 4H), 1.42 (s, 3H), 1.35-1.25 (m, 1H), 1.22 (s, 3H).

Hydrogen gas was bubbled through the mixture for about 5 minutes, then the mixture was stirred under 30 psi hydrogen for 48 h. The hydrogen source was removed and the mixture was purged with nitrogen for 5 minutes. The Pd/C was filtered off using a pad of Celite®, which was washed with ethyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated to afford 24 g yellow oil.

A suspension of N-(2-methyl-3-oxocyclopent-1-en-1-yl)acetamide [Huang, K.; Guan, Z.-H.; Zhang, X., Tet. Lett., 2014, 55, 1686-1688] (17.6 g, 115 mmol), 20% Pd(OH)2 (wet) (4.4 g, 28.8 mmol), and DIPEA (37.2 g, 288 mmol) in ethyl acetate (80 mL) was hydrogenated in a stainless steel reactor at 20 Bar and 80° C. for 18 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a bed of Celite®, and the filter cake washed with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and water (100 mL). The biphasic filtrate layers were separated, and the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (3×30 mL). The combined organics were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give a mixture of diastereomers of N-(3-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl)acetamide (20a, 2.32 g), as a yellow oil. A different mixture of 20a diastereomers remained in the aqueous layer, which were not isolated but carried on in solution. Both fractions were taken to the next step without further purification.
Solid potassium hydroxide (8.21 g, 146 mmol) was added portion wise to a solution of N-(3-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl)acetamide (20a, 2.30 g, from the organic extracts above) in water (100 mL). The mixture was heated to 90° C. for 72 h. After cooling the solution to room temperature, di-tert-butyl-dicarbonate (6.39 g, 29.3 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (150.0 mL) were added. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 48 h. After aqueous work-up the products were purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 0-80% ethyl acetate/heptane) to give tert-butyl (3-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl)carbamate (20b, 3.15 g) as a mixture of diastereomers. The aqueous layer from the first step, containing a different mixture of 20a diastereomers, was hydrolyzed and Boc-protected by the same procedure to give a second batch of 20b (10.1 g, mixture of diastereomers).
A solution of tert-butyl (3-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl)carbamate (20b, 9.3 g, 43.2 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (50 mL) was treated with hydrochloric acid (216 mL of a 4M solution in 1,4-dioxane, 864 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The volatiles were evaporated, leaving crude 3-amino-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol hydrochloride (20c, 7.0 g) as a mixture of diastereomers, which was used in the subsequent reaction without further purification. The other batches of 20b were treated similarly to obtain batches of 20c with different mixtures of diastereomers.
A solution of crude 3-amino-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol hydrochloride (20c, 7.0 g, 60.78 mmol, mixture of diastereomers), diisopropylethyl amine (39.3 g, 304 mmol), [4-chloro-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidin-5-yl]methanol (CAS#1044145-59-6) (11.6 g, 60.8 mmol) in DMSO (20 mL) was heated to 50° C. for 48 h. Triethylamine (18.5 g, 182 mmol) was added, and heating continued for 20 h more. The reaction mixture was poured into ice/water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×100 mL). The combined organics were washed with saturated aqueous NaCl (3×100 mL), washed with deionized water (100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to give 3-((5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylthio)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol as a mixture of diastereomers. The other batches of 20c were treated similarly to obtain different mixtures of diastereomers.
The various mixtures of 3-((5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-(methylthio)pyrimidin-4-yl)amino)-2-methylcyclopentan-1-ol diastereomers were resolved into four separate racemic pairs over several steps by crystallization, flash chromatography, and non-chiral preparative HPLC. Stereochemistry of the resulting enantiomeric pairs was determined by 2-D NMR.

Additional compounds of the invention were prepared by modifications of the methods exemplified herein. Except where otherwise indicated, all compounds having chiral centers were prepared and/or isolated as a single enantiomer having a known relative configuration. Compounds marked “absolute stereochemistry unknown” were typically prepared from racemic intermediates and resolved into single enantiomers by an appropriate chiral preparative SFC method before characterization and testing.
Where the absolute stereochemistry is unknown for a pair of enantiomers, the stereochemistry represented in Table 1 is assigned based on the sign of the optical rotation ([α]D20) and the relative biological activity, by analogy to compounds having known absolute configurations. Compounds marked “absolute stereochemistry known” were typically prepared from chiral intermediates having known stereochemistry.
Selected compounds and their corresponding characterization data are presented in Table 1 below.

Biological Assays and Data
CDK2/Cyclin E1 Mobility Shift Assay
The purpose of the CDK2/Cyclin E1 assay is to evaluate the inhibition (% inhibition, Kiapp and Ki values) of small molecule inhibitors by using a fluorescence-based microfluidic mobility shift assay. CDK2/Cyclin E1 catalyzes the production of ADP from ATP that accompanies the phosphoryl transfer to the substrate peptide FL-Peptide-18 (5-FAM-QSPKKG-CONH2) (SEQ ID NO:1). (CPC Scientific, Sunnyvale, Calif.). The mobility shift assay electrophoretically separates the fluorescently labeled peptides (substrate and phosphorylated product) following the kinase reaction. Both substrate and product are measured and the ratio of these values is used to generate % conversion of substrate to product by the LabChip EZ Reader. Wild-type full length CDK2/wild-type full length Cyclin E1 enzyme complex was produced in-house (baculoviral expression, LJIC-2080/LJIC-2103) and phosphorylated by CDK7/Cyclin H1/Mat1 enzyme complex with CDK2:CDK7 ratio of 50:1 (concentration mg/mL) in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2 and 5 mM ATP at room temperature for one hour. Typical reaction solutions (50 μL final reaction volume) contained 2% DMSO (±inhibitor), 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 150 μM ATP (ATP Km=67.4 μM), 0.005% Tween-20, 3 μM FL-Peptide-18, and 0.36 nM (catalytically competent active site) phosphorylated wild-type full length CDK2/Cyclin E1 enzyme complex in 25 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.15. The assay was initiated with the addition of ATP, following a fifteen minutes pre-incubation of enzyme and inhibitor at room temperature in the reaction mixture. The reaction was stopped after 45 minutes at room temperature by the addition of 50 μL of 80 mM EDTA, pH 7.5. The Ki value was determined from the fit of the data to the Morrison tight-binding competitive inhibition equation with the enzyme concentration as a variable.
CDK6/Cyclin D1 Mobility Shift Assay
The purpose of the CDK6/Cyclin D1 assay is to evaluate the inhibition (% inhibition, Kiapp and Ki values) in the presence of small molecule inhibitors by using a fluorescence based microfluidic mobility shift assay. CDK6/Cyclin D1 catalyzes the production of ADP from ATP that accompanies the phosphoryl transfer to the substrate peptide 5-FAM-Dyrktide (5-FAM-RRRFRPASPLRGPPK) (SEQ ID NO:2). The mobility shift assay electrophoretically separates the fluorescently labeled peptides (substrate and phosphorylated product) following the kinase reaction. Both substrate and product are measured and the ratio of these values is used to generate % conversion of substrate to product by the LabChip EZ Reader. Typical reaction solutions contained 2% DMSO (±inhibitor), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 0.005% Tween 20 (TW-20), 3 μM 5-FAM-Dyrktide, 3 nM (active sites) CDK6/Cyclin D1 in 40 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.5.
Inhibitor Ki determinations for non-phosphorylated CDK6/CyclinD1 (LJIC-2003A2/1865) were initiated with the addition of ATP (50 μL final reaction volume), following a twelve minute pre-incubation of enzyme and inhibitor at 22° C. in the reaction mix. The reaction was stopped after 35 minutes by the addition of 50 μL of 25 mM EDTA. Ki determinations were made from a plot of the fractional velocity as a function of inhibitor concentration fit to the Morrison equation with the enzyme concentration as a variable.

CDK4/Cyclin D3 Mobility Shift Assay
The purpose CDK4/Cyclin D3 assay is to evaluate the inhibition (% inhibition, Kiapp and Ki values) in the presence of small molecule inhibitors by using a fluorescence based microfluidic mobility shift assay. CDK4/Cyclin D3 catalyzes the production of ADP from ATP that accompanies the phosphoryl transfer to the substrate peptide 5-FAM-Dyrktide (5-FAM-RRRFRPASPLRGPPK) (SEQ ID NO:2). The mobility shift assay electrophoretically separates the fluorescently labeled peptides (substrate and phosphorylated product) following the kinase reaction. Both substrate and product are measured and the ratio of these values is used to generate % Conversion of substrate to product by the LabChip EZ Reader. Typical reaction solutions contained 2% DMSO (±inhibitor), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 2 mM ATP, 0.005% TW-20, 3 μM 5-FAM-Dyrktide, 2 nM (active sites) CDK4/Cyclin D3 in 40 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.5.
Inhibitor Ki determinations for non-phosphorylated CDK4/Cyclin D3 (LJIC-2007/2010) were initiated with the addition of ATP (50 μL final reaction volume), following a twelve minute pre-incubation of enzyme and inhibitor at 22° C. in the reaction mix. The reaction was stopped after 35 minutes by the addition of 50 μL of 25 mM EDTA. Ki determinations were made from a plot of the fractional velocity as a function of inhibitor concentration fit to the Morrison equation with the enzyme concentration as a variable.

Cell Based Assays
Cell Proliferation Assay
OVCAR3 or HCC1806 cells were seeded 3000 cells/well in 96-well plates in growth media containing 10% FBS and cultured overnight at 37° C. 5% CO2. The following day, compounds were serially diluted from a 10 mM top dose for an 11-point 3 fold dilution curve in DMSO. Compounds were intermediately diluted 1:200 into growth media prior to diluting 1:5 on cells for final concentration 10 μM to 0.1 nM in 0.1% DMSO on cells. Cells were incubated at 37° C. 5% CO2 for 7 days. CYQUANT Direct Cell Proliferation Assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) was then performed following manufacturer recommendations to determine the relative viable cell numbers on the Perkin Elmer Envision 2104 Multi Label Reader at 508 nM excitation and 527 nM emission wavelengths. IC50 values were calculated by concentration-response curve fitting utilizing a four-parameter analytical method using GraphPad Prism software.
FIG. 2C shows IC50 results for Example 10 and palbociclib in the OVCAR3 cell proliferation assay. FIG. 2D shows IC50 results for Example 10 and palbociclib in the HCC1806 cell proliferation assay.
Phospho-Serine 807/811 Rb ELISA
OVCAR3 or HCC1806 cells were seeded at 25,000 cells/well in 100 μL growth media and allowed to adhere at 37° C. with 5% CO2 overnight. The following day, compounds were serially diluted from a 10 mM top dose for an 11-point 3 fold dilution curve in DMSO. Compounds were intermediately diluted 1:200 into growth media prior to diluting 1:5 on cells for final concentration 10 μM to 0.1 nM in 0.1% DMSO on cells. OVCAR3 cells were treated for 1 hour, while HCC1806 cells were treated overnight, at 37° C. with 5% CO2. Cells were lysed in 100 μL/well CST lysis buffer on ice and transferred to pre-coated and blocked anti-phospho-Ser807/811 Rb ELISA plates for overnight incubation at 4° C. Plates were washed to remove residual, unbound cellular proteins and total Rb detection antibody added for 90 minutes at 37° C. Following wash to remove unbound total Rb antibody, HRP tagged antibody was allowed to bind for 30 minutes at 37° C. Following wash to remove unbound HRP antibody, Glo Substrate Reagent was added and incubated protected from light for 5 to 10 minutes. Plates were read in luminescence mode and IC50 values calculated.

Tumor Models
Ovcar3 Tumor Model
Ovcar3 tumor cell line, purchased from ATCC (ATCC HTB-161™) was cultured in RPMI1640 (1×) media (Gibco™ cat#11875-093) with 10% FBS (Gibco™ cat #26140-079). To establish a Ovcar3 xenograft model, 5×106 cells per mouse was implanted subcutaneously into right hind flank NSG mice (#5557-NOD.cg-Prkdc<scid> Jackson Lab). Cells were suspended in 50% matrigel (Cultrex Basement Membrane Extract (BME), Trevigen's Basement Membrane Matrix) and 50% RPMI1640 (1×) media (Gibco™ cat#11875-093) serum free media prior to implantation.
Animals were randomized 39 days after cells implantation with each group consisted of 4 mice. Treatment began when tumors reached 100 mm3-190 mm3 in size. Test compounds were prepared in 40% Captisol and dosed PO at 10 and 50 mg/kg QD or at 50 mg/kg BID as a suspension for 14 days. Animals were taken down at designated time. Mice receiving no drugs were given vehicle QD or BID for 14 days. Tumor volumes were measured once prior to randomization with an electric caliper, with tumor volumes were calculated using Length×Width×Width/2 formulation. Tumor volumes were measured twice a week with an electric caliper, with tumor volumes calculated using Length×Width×Width/2 formula. Animal weights were recorded twice weekly.
