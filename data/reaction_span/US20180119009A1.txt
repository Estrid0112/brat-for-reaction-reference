TECHNICAL FIELD
The invention relates to a liquid crystal compound, a liquid crystal composition and a liquid crystal display device. More specifically, the invention relates to a liquid crystal compound having a biphenylene ring and negative dielectric anisotropy, a liquid crystal composition containing the compound, and a liquid crystal display device including the composition.
BACKGROUND ART
In a liquid crystal display device, a classification based on an operating mode for liquid crystal molecules includes a phase change (PC) mode, a twisted nematic (TN) mode, a super twisted nematic (STN) mode, an electrically controlled birefringence (ECB) mode, an optically compensated bend (OCB) mode, an in-plane switching (IPS) mode, a vertical alignment (VA) mode, a fringe field switching (FFS) mode and a field-induced photo-reactive alignment (FPA) mode. A classification based on a driving mode in the device includes a passive matrix (PM) and an active matrix (AM). The PM is classified into static, multiplex and so forth, and the AM is classified into a thin film transistor (TFT), a metal insulator metal (MIM) and so forth.
The device is sealed with a liquid crystal composition. Physical properties of the composition relate to characteristics in the device. Specific examples of the physical properties in the composition include stability to heat or light, a temperature range of a nematic phase, viscosity, optical anisotropy, dielectric anisotropy, specific resistance and an elastic constant. The composition is prepared by mixing many liquid crystal compounds. Physical properties required for a compound include high stability to environment such as water, air, heat and light, a wide temperature range of a liquid crystal phase, small viscosity, large optical anisotropy, large dielectric anisotropy, a suitable elastic constant and good compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds. A compound having high maximum temperature of the nematic phase is preferred. A compound having low minimum temperature in the liquid crystal phase such as the nematic phase and a smectic phase is preferred. A compound having the small viscosity can shorten a response time in the device. A compound having large optical anisotropy can decrease cell thickness in the device, and therefore can shorten the response time. A compound having large positive or negative dielectric anisotropy is preferred for driving the device at low voltage. A compound having good compatibility with other liquid crystal compounds is preferred for preparing the composition. The device may be occasionally used at a temperature below freezing point, and therefore a compound having good compatibility at low temperature is preferred.
Many liquid crystal compounds have been so far prepared. Development of a new liquid crystal compound has been still continued. The reason is that good physical properties that are not found in conventional compounds are expected from a new compound. The reason is that the new compound may be occasionally provided with a suitable balance regarding at least two physical properties in the composition. Only a limited number of reports has been found on a compound having a biphenylene ring.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
Usage of terms herein is as described below. Terms “liquid crystal compound,” “liquid crystal composition” and “liquid crystal display device” may be occasionally abbreviated as “compound,” “composition” and “device,” respectively. “Liquid crystal compound” is a generic term for a compound having a liquid crystal phase such as a nematic phase and a smectic phase, and a compound having no liquid crystal phase but to be added for the purpose of adjusting physical properties of a composition, such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, viscosity and dielectric anisotropy. The compound has a six-membered ring such as 1,4-cyclohexylene and 1,4-phenylene, and has rod-like molecular structure. “Liquid crystal display device” is a generic term for a liquid crystal display panel and a liquid crystal display module. “Polymerizable compound” is a compound to be added for the purpose of forming a polymer in the composition.
The liquid crystal composition is prepared by mixing a plurality of liquid crystal compounds. An additive is added to the composition for the purpose of further adjusting the physical properties. The additive such as a polymerizable compound, a polymerization initiator, a polymerization inhibitor, an optically active compound, an antioxidant, an ultraviolet light absorber, a light stabilizer, a heat stabilizer, a dye and an antifoaming agent is added thereto when necessary. The liquid crystal compound and the additive are mixed in such a procedure. A proportion (content) of the liquid crystal compounds is expressed in terms of weight percent (% by weight) based on the weight of the liquid crystal composition containing no additive, even after the additive has been added. A proportion (amount of addition) of the additive is expressed in terms of weight percent (% by weight) based on the weight of the liquid crystal composition containing no additive. Weight parts per million (ppm) may be occasionally used. A proportion of the polymerization initiator and the polymerization inhibitor is exceptionally expressed based on the weight of the polymerizable compound.
“Clearing point” is a transition temperature between the liquid crystal phase and an isotropic phase in the liquid crystal compound. “Minimum temperature of the liquid crystal phase” is a transition temperature between a solid and the liquid crystal phase (the smectic phase, the nematic phase or the like) in the liquid crystal compound. “Maximum temperature of the nematic phase” is a transition temperature between the nematic phase and the isotropic phase in a mixture of the liquid crystal compound and a base liquid crystal or in the liquid crystal composition, and may be occasionally abbreviated as “maximum temperature.” “Minimum temperature of the nematic phase” may be occasionally abbreviated as “minimum temperature.” An expression “increase the dielectric anisotropy” means that a value of dielectric anisotropy positively increases in a composition having positive dielectric anisotropy, and the value of dielectric anisotropy negatively increases in a composition having negative dielectric anisotropy. An expression “having a large voltage holding ratio” means that the device has a large voltage holding ratio at room temperature and also at a temperature close to the maximum temperature in an initial stage, and the device has the large voltage holding ratio at room temperature and also at a temperature close to the maximum temperature even after the device has been used for a long period of time. In the composition or the device, the characteristics may be occasionally examined before and after an aging test (including an acceleration deterioration test).
A compound represented by formula (1) may be occasionally abbreviated as compound (1). At least one compound selected from the group of compounds represented by formula (1) may be occasionally abbreviated as compound (1). “Compound (1)” means one compound, a mixture of two compounds or a mixture of three or more compounds represented by formula (1). A same rule applies also to any other compound represented by any other formula. In formulas (1) to (15), a symbol of A1, B1, C1 or the like surrounded by a hexagonal shape corresponds to ring A1, ring B1 and ring C1, respectively. The hexagonal shape represents a six-membered ring such as cyclohexane or benzene. The hexagonal shape may occasionally represents a fused ring such as naphthalene or a bridged ring such as adamantane.
A symbol of terminal group R11 is used in a plurality of compounds in chemical formulas of component compounds. In the compounds, two groups represented by two pieces of arbitrary R11 may be identical or different. For example, in one case, R11 of compound (2) is ethyl and R11 of compound (3) is ethyl. In another case, R11 of compound (2) is ethyl and R11 of compound (3) is propyl. A same rule applies also to a symbol of R12, R13, Z11 or the like. In compound (15), when i is 2, two of ring E1 exists. In the compound, two groups represented by two of ring E1 may be identical or different. A same rule applies also to two of arbitrary ring E1 when i is larger than 2. A same rule applies also to other symbols.
An expression “at least one piece of ‘A’” means that the number of ‘A’ is arbitrary. An expression “at least one piece of ‘A’ may be replaced by ‘B’” means that, when the number of ‘A’ is 1, a position of ‘A’ is arbitrary, and also when the number of ‘A’ is 2 or more, positions thereof can be selected without restriction. A same rule applies also to an expression “at least one piece of ‘A’ is replaced by ‘B’.” An expression “at least one piece of ‘A’ may be replaced by ‘B’, ‘C’ or ‘D’” includes a case where arbitrary ‘A’ is replaced by ‘B’, a case where arbitrary ‘A’ is replaced by ‘C’, and a case where arbitrary ‘A’ is replaced by ‘D’, and also a case where a plurality of pieces of ‘A’ are replaced by at least two pieces of ‘B’, ‘C’ and/or ‘D’. For example, “alkyl in which at least one piece of -CH2- may be replaced by -O- or -CH═CH-” includes alkyl, alkoxy, alkoxyalkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyalkenyl and alkenyloxyalkyl. In addition, a case where two pieces of consecutive -CH2- are replaced by -O- to form -O-O- is not preferred. In alkyl or the like, a case where -CH2- of a methyl part (-CH2-H) is replaced by -O- to form -O-H is not preferred, either.
An expression “R11 and R12 are independently alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons or alkenyl having 2 to 10 carbons, and in the alkyl and the alkenyl, at least one piece of -CH2- may be replaced by -O-, and in the groups, at least one hydrogen may be replaced by fluorine” may be occasionally used. In the expression, “in the groups” may be interpreted according to wording. In the expression, “the groups” means alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, alkenyloxy or the like. More specifically, “the groups” represents all of the groups described before the term “in the groups.” Common interpretation is applied also to terms of “in the monovalent groups” or “in the divalent groups.” For example, “the monovalent groups” represents all of the groups described before the term “in the monovalent groups.”
Halogen means fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Preferred halogen is fluorine and chlorine. Further preferred halogen is fluorine. Alkyl of the liquid crystal compound is straight-chain alkyl or branched-chain alkyl, but includes no cyclic alkyl. In general, straight-chain alkyl is preferred to branched-chain alkyl. A same rule applies also to a terminal group such as alkoxy and alkenyl. With regard to a configuration of 1,4-cyclohexylene, trans is preferred to cis for increasing the maximum temperature. Then, 2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene means two divalent groups described below. In a chemical formula, fluorine may be leftward (L) or rightward (R). A same rule applies also to an asymmetrical divalent group formed by removing two hydrogens from a ring, such as tetrahydropyran-2,5-diyl.

Component (c) has large negative dielectric anisotropy. Component (c) is used when a composition for the IPS mode, the VA mode, the PSA mode or the like is prepared. As a content of component (c) is increased, the dielectric anisotropy of the composition is negatively increased, but the viscosity is increased. Thus, as long as a desired value of threshold voltage of the device is met, the content is preferably as small as possible. When the dielectric anisotropy at a degree of −5 is taken into account, the content is preferably about 40% by weight or more in order to allow a sufficient voltage driving.
Among types of component (c), compound (5) is a bicyclic compound, and therefore is effective in decreasing the viscosity, adjusting the optical anisotropy or increasing the dielectric anisotropy. Compounds (5) and (6) are a tricyclic compound, and therefore are effective in increasing the maximum temperature, the optical anisotropy or the dielectric anisotropy. Compounds (8) to (11) are effective in increasing the dielectric anisotropy.

When component (c) is added to the composition having positive dielectric anisotropy, the content of component (c) is preferably about 30% by weight or less. Addition of component (c) allows adjustment of the elastic constant of the composition and adjustment of a voltage-transmittance curve of the device.

Component (e) has positive dielectric anisotropy and a value thereof is large, and therefore component (e) is used when a composition for the TN mode or the like is prepared. Addition of component (e) can increase the dielectric anisotropy of the composition. Component (e) is effective in extending the temperature range of the liquid crystal phase, adjusting the viscosity or adjusting the optical anisotropy. Component (e) is also useful for adjustment of the voltage-transmittance curve of the device.
When the composition for the TN mode or the like is prepared, a content of component (e) is suitably in the range of about 1% by weight to about 99% by weight, preferably in the range of about 10% by weight to about 97% by weight, and further preferably in the range of about 40% by weight to about 95% by weight, based on the weight of the liquid crystal composition. When component (e) is added to a composition having negative dielectric anisotropy, the content of component (e) is preferably about 30% by weight or less. Addition of component (e) allows adjustment of the elastic constant of the composition and adjustment of the voltage-transmittance curve of the device.
A liquid crystal composition satisfying at least one of physical properties such as high stability to heat or light, high maximum temperature, low minimum temperature, small viscosity, suitable optical anisotropy (more specifically, large optical anisotropy or small optical anisotropy), large positive or negative dielectric anisotropy, large specific resistance and a suitable elastic constant (more specifically, a large elastic constant or a small elastic constant) can be prepared by combining a compound suitably selected from components (b) to (e) described above with compound (1). A device including such a composition has a wide temperature range in which the device can be used, a short response time, a large voltage holding ratio, low threshold voltage, a large contrast ratio, a small flicker rate and a long service life.
If the device is used for a long period of time, a flicker may be occasionally generated on a display screen. The flicker rate (%) can be represented by a formula (|luminance when applying positive voltage−luminance when applying negative voltage|)/(average luminance)×100. In a device having the flicker rate in the range of about 0% to about 1%, a flicker is hardly generated on the display screen even if the device is used for a long period of time. The flicker is associated with image persistence, and is presumed to be generated according to a difference in electric potential between a positive frame and a negative frame in driving at alternating current. The composition containing compound (1) is also useful for a decrease in generation of the flicker.
3-2. Additive
A liquid crystal composition is prepared according to a publicly known method. For example, the component compounds are mixed and dissolved in each other by heating. According to an application, an additive may be added to the composition. Specific examples of the additives include the polymerizable compound, the polymerization initiator, the polymerization inhibitor, the optically active compound, the antioxidant, the ultraviolet light absorber, the light stabilizer, the heat stabilizer, the dye and the antifoaming agent. Such additives are well known to those skilled in the art, and described in literature.
In a liquid crystal display device having the polymer sustained alignment (PSA) mode, the composition contains a polymer. The polymerizable compound is added for the purpose of forming the polymer in the composition. The polymerizable compound is polymerized by irradiation with ultraviolet light while voltage is applied between electrodes, and thus the polymer is formed in the composition. A suitable pretilt is achieved by the method, and therefore the device in which a response time is shortened and the image persistence is improved is prepared.
Preferred examples of the polymerizable compound include acrylate, methacrylate, a vinyl compound, a vinyloxy compound, propenyl ether, an epoxy compound (oxirane, oxetane) and vinyl ketone. Further preferred examples include a compound having at least one acryloyloxy, and a compound having at least one methacryloyloxy. Still further preferred examples also include a compound having both acryloyloxy and methacryloyloxy.
Still further preferred examples include compounds (M-1) to (M-18). In the compounds, R25 to R31 are independently hydrogen or methyl; R32, R33 and R34 are independently hydrogen or alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons, and at least one of R32, R33 and R34 is alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons; v, w and x are independently 0 or 1; and u and y are independently an integer from 1 to 10. L21 to L26 are independently hydrogen or fluorine; and L27 and L28 are independently hydrogen, fluorine or methyl.

The polymerizable compound can be rapidly polymerized by adding the polymerization initiator. An amount of a remaining polymerizable compound can be reduced by optimizing reaction conditions. Specific examples of a photoradical polymerization initiator include TPO, 1173 and 4265 from Darocur series of BASF SE, and 184, 369, 500, 651, 784, 819, 907, 1300, 1700, 1800, 1850 and 2959 from Irgacure series thereof.
Additional examples of the photoradical polymerization initiator include 4-methoxyphenyl-2,4-bis(trichloromethyl)triazine, 2-(4-butoxystyryl)-5-trichloromethyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole, 9-phenylacridine, 9,10-benzphenazine, a benzophenone-Michler's ketone mixture, a hexaarylbiimidazole-mercaptobenzimidazole mixture, 1-(4-isopropylphenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropane-1-one, benzyl dimethyl ketal, 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-morpholinopropane-1-one, a mixture of 2,4-diethylxanthone and methyl p-dimethylaminobenzoate, and a mixture of benzophenone and methyltriethanolamine.
After the photoradical polymerization initiator is added to the liquid crystal composition, polymerization can be performed by irradiation with ultraviolet light while an electric field is applied. However, an unreacted polymerization initiator or a decomposition product of the polymerization initiator may cause poor display such as the image persistence in the device. In order to prevent such an event, photopolymerization may be performed with no addition of the polymerization initiator. A preferred wavelength of irradiation light is in the range of about 150 nanometers to about 500 nanometers. A further preferred wavelength is in the range of about 250 nanometers to about 450 nanometers, and a most preferred wavelength is in the range of about 300 nanometers to about 400 nanometers.
Upon storing the polymerizable compound, the polymerization inhibitor may be added thereto for preventing polymerization. The polymerizable compound is ordinarily added to the composition without removing the polymerization inhibitor. Specific examples of the polymerization inhibitor include hydroquinone, a hydroquinone derivative such as methylhydroquinone, 4-t-butylcatechol, 4-methoxyphenol and phenothiazine.
The optically active compound is effective in inducing helical structure in liquid crystal molecules to give a required twist angle, and thereby preventing a reverse twist. A helical pitch can be adjusted by adding the optically active compound thereto. Two or more optically active compounds may be added for the purpose of adjusting temperature dependence of the helical pitch. Specific examples of a preferred optically active compound include compounds (Op-1) to (Op-18) described below. In compound (Op-18), ring J is 1,4-cyclohexylene or 1,4-phenylene, and R28 is alkyl having 1 to 10 carbons. Asterisk mark (*) represents asymmetrical carbon.

In the compositions, a lot of polymerizable compounds are added. On the other hand, when a proportion of the polymerizable compound is about 10% by weight or less based on the weight of the liquid crystal composition, the liquid crystal display device having the PSA mode can be prepared. A preferred proportion is in the range of about 0.1% by weight to about 2% by weight. A further preferred proportion is in the range of about 0.2% by weight to about 1.0% by weight.

A temperature of a sample vaporizing chamber and a temperature of a detector (FID) were set to 300° C. and 300° C., respectively. A sample was dissolved in acetone and prepared to be a 1 weight % solution, and then 1 microliter of the solution obtained was injected into the sample vaporizing chamber. As a recorder, GC Solution System made by Shimadzu Corporation or the like was used.

A sample was dissolved in acetonitrile and prepared to be a 0.01 mmol/L solution, and measurement was carried out by putting the solution in a quartz cell (optical path length: 1 cm).
Sample for measurement: Upon measuring phase structure and a transition temperature (a clearing point, a melting point, a polymerization starting temperature or the like), the compound itself was used as a sample. Upon measuring physical properties such as maximum temperature of a nematic phase, viscosity, optical anisotropy and dielectric anisotropy, a mixture of a compound and a base liquid crystal was used as a sample.
When the sample prepared by mixing the compound with the base liquid crystal was used, measurement was carried out as described below. The sample was prepared by mixing 15% by weight of the compound and 85% by weight of the base liquid crystal. From a measured value of the sample, an extrapolated value was calculated according to the following equation, and the calculated value was described: [extrapolated value]=(100×[measured value of a sample]−[% by weight of a base liquid crystal]×[measured value of the base liquid crystal])/[% by weight of a compound].
When crystals (or a smectic phase) precipitated at 25° C. at the ratio, a ratio of the compound to the base liquid crystal was changed in the order of (10% by weight:90% by weight), (5% by weight:95% by weight) and (1% by weight:99% by weight), and the physical properties of the sample were measured at a ratio at which no crystal (or no smectic phase) precipitated at 25° C. In addition, unless otherwise noted, the ratio of the compound to the base liquid crystal was (15% by weight:85% by weight).
When the dielectric anisotropy of the compound was zero or positive, base liquid crystal (A) described below was used. A proportion of each component was expressed in terms of weight percent (% by weight).

Measuring method: Physical properties were measured according to methods described below. Most of the methods are described in the Standard of Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) discussed and established in JEITA (JEITA ED-2521B). A modified method was also applied. No thin film transistor (TFT) was attached to a TN device used for measurement.
(1) Phase structure: A sample was placed on a hot plate in a melting point apparatus (FP-52 Hot Stage made by Mettler-Toledo International Inc.) equipped with a polarizing microscope. A state of phase and a change thereof were observed with the polarizing microscope while the sample was heated at a rate of 3° C. per minute, and a kind of the phase was specified.
(2) Transition temperature (° C.): For measurement, a differential scanning calorimeter, Diamond DSC System, made by PerkinElmer, Inc., or a high sensitivity differential scanning calorimeter, X-DSC7000, made by SII NanoTechnology Inc. was used. A sample was heated and then cooled at a rate of 3° C. per minute, and a starting point of an endothermic peak or an exothermic peak caused by a phase change of the sample was determined by extrapolation, and thus a transition temperature was determined. A melting point and a polymerization starting temperature of a compound were also measured using the apparatus. Temperature at which a compound undergoes transition from a solid to a liquid crystal phase such as the smectic phase and the nematic phase may be occasionally abbreviated as “minimum temperature of the liquid crystal phase.” Temperature at which the compound undergoes transition from the liquid crystal phase to liquid may be occasionally abbreviated as “clearing point.”
A crystal was expressed as C. When the crystals were distinguishable into two kinds, each of the crystals was expressed as C1 or C2. The smectic phase or the nematic phase was expressed as S or N. When a phase was distinguishable such as smectic A phase, smectic B phase, smectic C phase and smectic F, the phase was expressed as SA, SB, SC and SF, respectively. A liquid (isotropic) was expressed as I. A transition temperature was expressed as “C 50.0 N 100.0 I,” for example. The expression indicates that a transition temperature from the crystals to the nematic phase is 50.0° C., and a transition temperature from the nematic phase to the liquid is 100.0° C.
(3) Compatibility of compound: Samples in which the base liquid crystal and the compound were mixed for proportions of the compounds to be 20% by weight, 15% by weight, 10% by weight, 5% by weight, 3% by weight or 1% by weight were prepared. The samples were put in a glass vials, and kept in freezers at −10° C. or −20° C. for a predetermined period of time. Whether a nematic phase of the samples was maintained or crystals (or a smectic phase) precipitated was observed. Conditions on which the nematic phase was maintained were used as a measure of the compatibility. Proportions of the compounds and each temperature in the freezers may be occasionally changed when necessary.
(4) Maximum temperature of nematic phase (TNI or NI; ° C.): A sample was placed on a hot plate in a melting point apparatus equipped with a polarizing microscope, and heated at a rate of 1° C. per minute. Temperature when part of the sample began to change from a nematic phase to an isotropic liquid was measured. When the sample was a mixture of compound (1) and the base liquid crystal, the maximum temperature was expressed in terms of a symbol TNI. When the sample was a mixture of compound (1) and a compound selected from compounds (2) to (15), the maximum temperature was expressed in terms of a symbol NI. A maximum temperature of the nematic phase may be occasionally abbreviated as “maximum temperature.”
(5) Minimum temperature of nematic phase (TC; ° C.): Samples each having a nematic phase were put in glass vials and kept in freezers at temperatures of 0° C., −10° C., −20° C., −30° C. and −40° C. for 10 days, and then liquid crystal phases were observed. For example, when the sample was maintained in the nematic phase at −20° C. and changed to crystals or a smectic phase at −30° C., TC was expressed as TC<−20° C. A minimum temperature of the nematic phase may be occasionally abbreviated as “minimum temperature.”
(6) Viscosity (bulk viscosity; η; measured at 20° C.; mPa·s): For measurement, a cone-plate (E type) rotational viscometer made by Tokyo Keiki Inc. was used.
