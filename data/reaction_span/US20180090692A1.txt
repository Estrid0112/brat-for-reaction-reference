BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to an organometallic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, and excellent brightness, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics, compared to devices in the art and produce full-color images.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transit from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.
SUMMARY
One or more embodiments include a novel organometallic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
Additional aspects will be set forth in part in the description which follows and, in part, will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the presented embodiments.

The organometallic compound may satisfy the following conditions: “i) when n1 in Formula 1 is three, a) X2 and X3 in Formula 2A is N; or b) at least one of X4 to X6 in Formula 2A is N, and R7 is an electron withdrawing group, and ii) when n1 in Formula 1 is one or two, a) at least one of X3, X5, and X6 in Formula 2A is N; and b) X1 in Formula 2A is C(R1), X4 is C(R4), and at least one of R1 and R4 is an electron withdrawing group.”
The organometallic compound described above may have a high bond dissociation energy level (eV) between a relatively large metal (M in Formula 1) and a ligand (L1 when n2 in Formula 1 is zero, and L1 and L2 when n2 in Formula 1 is not zero), and thus, intrinsic degradation of the organometallic compound may be minimized. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress the generation of a decomposition product (for example, ligand species separated from a metal) due to a decomposition of the organometallic compound that may act as a quencher to reduce luminescent efficiency in an electronic device (for example, an organic light-emitting device) including the organometallic compound. Thus, the electronic device (for example, the organic light-emitting device) including the organometallic compound may have a long lifespan.
In one or more embodiments, a minimum bond disassociation energy level (eV) between the metal and the ligand of the organometallic compound may be higher than a minimum triplet energy level (eV) of the organometallic compound.
In one or more embodiments, the minimum bond dissociation energy level (eV) between the metal and the ligand of the organometallic compound may be higher than the minimum triplet energy level (eV) of the organometallic compound by 0.002 eV or more, for example, 0.5 eV or more, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto.
The organometallic compound may have a minimum excitation triplet energy level of 2.7 eV to 3.2 eV.
The organometallic compound may emit blue light. For example, the organometallic compound may emit blue light having a maximum light emission wavelength of about 392 nm to about 460 nm at 77 Kelvin, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto.
Synthesis methods of the organometallic compound represented by Formula 1 may be recognizable by those of ordinary skill in the art by referring to Examples provided below.
At least one organometallic compound represented by Formula 1 may be used between a pair of electrodes of an organic light-emitting device. For example, the organometallic compound may be included in an emission layer. The organometallic compound included in the emission layer may act as a dopant.
Accordingly, an organic light-emitting device may include: a first electrode; a second electrode facing the first electrode; and an organic layer between the first electrode and the second electrode, the organic layer including an emission layer, wherein the organic layer may include at least one organometallic compound represented by Formula 1.
The expression “(an organic layer) includes at least one organometallic compound” used herein may include a case in which “(an organic layer) includes one organometallic compound represented by Formula 1” and a case in which “(an organic layer) includes two or more different organometallic compounds represented by Formula 1.”
For example, the organic layer may include, as the organometallic compound, only Compound 1-1. In this regard, Compound 1-1 may exist in an emission layer of the organic light-emitting device. In one or more embodiments, the organic layer may include, as the organometallic compound, Compound 1-1 and Compound 1-2. In this regard, Compound 1-1 and Compound 1-2 may exist in an identical layer (for example, Compound 1-1 and Compound 1-2 all may exist in an emission layer), or may exist in different layers (for example, Compound 1-1 may exist in an emission layer and Compound 1-2 may exist in an electron transport region).
According to one or more embodiments,
the first electrode of the organic light-emitting device may be an anode,
the second electrode of the organic light-emitting device may be a cathode,

The term “organic layer” used herein refers to a single layer and/or multiple layers between the first electrode and the second electrode of the organic light-emitting device. A material included in the “organic layer” is not limited to an organic material.

CBP (host) and Compound 1-5 (dopant) were co-deposited on the hole transport layer at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
BCP was co-deposited on the emission layer to form a hole blocking layer having a thickness of 200 Å, Alq3 was deposited on the hole blocking layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å LiF was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å and then, Al was vacuum-deposited on the electron injection layer to form a cathode having a thickness of 3,000 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
