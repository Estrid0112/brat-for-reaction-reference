CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
The present application hereby claims the benefit of EPO Patent Application No. 14382561.0 filed Dec. 23, 2014.
FIELD
Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to a polyethylene composition, more particularly, a polyethylene composition yielding improved optical performance via inclusion of a bisamide nucleating agent.
BACKGROUND
Polyethylene compositions and resins are utilized in various applications and articles, for example, in the production of molded articles, blown films, and various other articles. Additives used for increasing the rate of nucleation during crystallization of semi-crystalline polymers are termed nucleators or nucleating agents. The addition of nucleating agents typically increases the overall rate of crystallization, and crystallization temperature of the polymers. This generally translates to faster solidification, and may be used to reduce the cycle time in processes like injection molding. Nucleators may also influence other properties, such as stiffness, toughness, haze, gloss, permeability and shrinkage. Nucleators that improve optical properties like haze and clarity are termed clarifiers. Various organic and/or inorganic additives may serve as nucleators, such as benzoic acids, talc, pigments, sorbitols, phosphate ester derivatives, and other polymeric species.
Derivatives of dibenzylidene sorbitol are well known clarifiers for polypropylene resins and films. The use of clarifiers in polyethylene resins and films is not common, due to much higher rates of crystallization in polyethylene compared to polypropylene, which makes haze reduction and the improvement of optical properties more challenging for polyethylene films and resins. Regarding the use of clarifiers, there is no known correlation between effective haze reduction for polypropylene compositions and effective haze reduction for polyethylene compositions.
Accordingly, there may be a continual need for nucleating agents which increase the rate of crystallization in polyethylene compositions while also reducing the haze and thereby improve the optical properties.
SUMMARY
Embodiments of the present invention are directed to polyethylene compositions having bisamide nucleating agents which reduce haze in the polyethylene compositions while also increasing the rate of crystallization in the polyethylene composition.
According to one embodiment, a polyethylene composition is provided comprising: at least 50% by wt. of at least one polyethylene polymer; and 0.001 to 2% by wt. nucleating agent comprising a structure of formulas (I), (II), or (III):

As used herein, “polyethylene composition” means any formulation comprising polyethylene polymer solely or with additional components, such as an additional polymer. As used herein, “polyethylene polymer” refers to a polymer made of 100% ethylene-monomer units, i.e., a homopolymer, or to copolymers produced with other monomeric moieties such as α-olefins, e.g. propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene or 1-octene, etc. Various polyethylene polymers are contemplated as suitable. For example and not by way of limitation, the polyethylene polymers may include a high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), very low density polyethylene (VLDPE), and ultra low density polyethylene (ULDPE), or mixtures thereof.
In one or more embodiments, the polyethylene polymer may have a melt index (12) ≦50 g/10 min, wherein 12 is measured according to ASTM D1238 at 190° C. and 2.16 kg load, and a density about 0.855 to about 0.970 g/cm3. In other embodiments, the 12 may be ≦25 g/10 min, or ≦10 g/10 min. In further embodiments, the density may be 0.900-0.955 g/cm3, or 0.910-0.940 g/cm3.
For example and not by way of limitation, suitable commercial examples of the LLDPE may include one or more of DOWLEX® 2045 G, DOWLEX® 2552 E, or TUFLIN™ HS-7028 which are available from The Dow Chemical Company, Midland Mich. Other compositions having either homogeneous or heterogeneous short chain branching distributions, or compositions with broad or narrow molecular weight distributions are considered suitable. Various other resins, such as EXCEED™ from Exxon-Mobil, or EVOLUE™ from Prime Polymer Co., Ltd. are also contemplated.
The polyethylene composition comprises greater than about 50% by wt., or greater than about 60% by wt., or greater than about 70% by wt., or greater than about 80% by wt., or greater than about 90% by wt. of polyethylene polymer. Additionally, the polyethylene composition may comprise about 0.001 to about 2% by wt., or about 0.001 to about 1% by wt., or about 0.005 to about 1% by wt, or about 0.01 to about 0.5% by wt., or about 0.1 to about 0.5% by wt., or 0.01 to about 0.1 wt % of the nucleating agent. Without being bound by theory, haze reduction may vary depending on which R (R1 and R2) groups are utilized in structures I, II, and III. Specifically, the various R groups may have various solubilities inside the polyethylene composition. Unsolubilized nucleating agent may increase haze, thus selecting a concentration which minimizes the amount of unsolubilized nucleating agent may be beneficial.
In one embodiment, the polyethylene composition is substantially free of polypropylene. In additional embodiments, it is contemplated to include further polymers for blending with the polyethylene polymer. For example, it is contemplated to include a blend of multiple polyethylene polymers. Moreover, it is also contemplated to blend the polyethylene polymers with a polypropylene polymer. For example, it is contemplated that a second polymer may be included in amounts from about 0.5 to about 45% by wt., or about 1 to about 25% by wt., or about 5 to about 15% by wt.
The polyethylene composition may be formed into various articles. For example, the article may be a blown film, a cast film, or a molded article (for example, injection molding, or rotational molding). The articles may be extruded or formed into various extruded profiles such as sheets, pipes, or tubes. Moreover, in further embodiments, the articles may be melt-spun fibers. Upon inclusion of the present bisamide nucleating agents, the article may achieve a haze value reduction of at least 15% when compared to an article having the same polyethylene polymer but without the bisamide nucleating agent. In further embodiment, the article may achieve a haze reduction of at least 20%, or at least 25%, or at least 30%, or at least 35%, or at least 40% when compared to an article having the same polyethylene polymer but without the bisamide nucleating agent.

DOWLEX 2045G is an ethylene-octene copolymer suitable for blown film applications. DOWLEX 2552E is an ethylene-octene copolymer suitable for injection molding and fiber applications. DOWLEX HS7028 NT7 is an ethylene-hexene copolymer suitable for blown film applications. Density was measured per ASTM D792, the melt index per ASTM D1238.
Small-Scale Compounding and Injection Molding for Haze Measurements
Blends of the polyethylene resins with the nucleators were prepared in a laboratory co-rotating mini-twin-screw extruder (Xplore from DSM, 15.0 ml volume) at 40 r.p.m. for 5 min at 220° C., in a nitrogen blanket. First, a masterbatch of 2% by weight of the nucleator was made in the polyethylene resin. This masterbatch was diluted and re-compounded with neat polyethylene resin to achieve the desired final concentration of the nucleator in the polymer. The melt from the extruder was injected into a circular mold kept at room temperature to produce plaques of 1.0 mm thickness and 25.0 mm diameter.
Haze Measurements for Molded Samples
The haze of the injection-molded samples was determined at room temperature with a Haze-Gard Plus® instrument (BYK Gardner GmbH, Germany) according to ASTM standard D1003. A circular area on the plaque samples, 18.0 mm in diameter, was illuminated by the light beam; the recorded haze values are referred to as “overall-area haze”. In addition, haze values of a circular area with 8.0 mm diameter on samples (those free of surface irregularities) were recorded and are referred to as “small-area haze”. In order to eliminate the effect of surface scattering, “bulk haze” measurements were conducted by filling a 50.0×45.0×2.5 mm cuvette, (AT-6180 from BYK Gardner GmbH, Germany) with non-drying immersion oil (Cargille Series A refractive index oil of n=1.5150±0.0002) and inserting samples therein. Haze values reported here correspond to the average of values from five measurements.

Part C: Polyethylene Film
Compounds were prepared with DOWLEX 2045G and BCPCA as follows: the respective amounts of additive and base polymer were put into a plastic bag and thoroughly mixed by turning the bag. The powder mixtures were extruded on a twin screw extruder (Leistritz ZSE MAXX, screw diameter=27 mm; screw 1/d ratio=48). Before extruding the additive mixtures the extruder was cleaned with standard LDPE and after that with 2 kg of the base polymer. Processing parameters: Cylinder temperature: 170° C. (all heating zones), screw speed: 300-400 U/min, output: 25-30 kg/h. The extruded strands were cooled in a water bath and cut with a pelletizer. The obtained granulate was mixed in a mixer and packed into PE plastic bags.
Exemplary monolayer polyethylene films comprising the DOWLEX 2045G and BCPCA compounds were produced on a monolayer blown film line. Additional process parameters are provided in Table 10 below, and haze results are provided in Table 11 below.

Part D: Comparison to Trisamide Clarifier
For polypropylene films, trisamide derivatives have demonstrated improvements in optical properties, such as haze reduction; however, they have not demonstrated the same level of improvement in polyethylene films.
The following table depicts the haze reduction yielded by tris(cyclohexylmethyl)-1,3,5-phenylene dicarboxamide (TCPCA) and BCPCA when incorporated into a DOWLEX 2552E LLDPE plaque having a thickness of 1 mm. As shown, the haze-reducing effect of a trisamide was compared to a bisamide, which has the same R-group moieties. Various haze measurements were conducted at increasing concentrations up to 2% of the bisamide and trisamide, and the minimum haze in the concentration range was provided below. As shown, at 0.1% concentration, there is a haze reduction of over 40% (90.0-49.8=40.2%).
