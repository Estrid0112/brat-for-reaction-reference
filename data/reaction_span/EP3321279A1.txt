FIELD
The present invention relates to the field of therapeutic peptides, particularly relates to exenatide modifiers, their preparation, a pharmaceutical composition containing the same, and the use of the modifiers and composition in the treatment of diseases associated with glycometabolism.
BACKGROUND
Exenatide (or Exendin-4, trade name by Byetta) is a polypeptide of 39 amino acids with a molecular weight of 4186.6, the molecular formula of which is C184H282N50O60S, and the amino acid sequence is: His-Gly-Glu-Gly-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ser-Asp-Leu-Ser-Lys-Gln-Met-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ala-Val-Arg-Leu -Phe-Ile-Glu-Trp-Leu-Lys-Asn-Gly-Gly-Pro-Ser-Ser-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-Pro-Ser-NH2; which is produced and sold by Amylin Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly company (Eli Lilly and Company). Exenatide has been approved by FDA in April 2005, which belongs to subcutaneous injection preparation, with effects of promoting the glucose-dependent insulin secretion, recovering the insulin secretion of the first phase, inhibiting the glucagon secretion, slowing the emptying of gastric contents, improving the function of pancreatic β cells, and the like, being very useful in the treatment of type II diabetes, for example, to improve and control the blood glucose of patients with type II diabetes which are not ideal when treated by metformin and sulfonylurea drugs.
Exenatide is a synthetic form of the hormone, exendin-4, in the saliva of lizard, Heloderma suspectum (Gilamonster) grown in several states in the southwestern United States (J.Biol.Chem.1990, 265, 20259-20262; J.Biol.Chem.1992, 267, 7402-7405), which is an analogue of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), the amino acid sequence of which is partially overlapped with the amino acid sequence of GLP-1, being a potent GLP-1 receptor agonist, and also being known as an incretin agonist since that exenatide simulates the glucose regulation effect of GLP-1. Unlike sulfonylureas and meglitinides, exenatide increases the synthesis and secretion of insulin only in the presence of glucose, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. Some physicians will also use Byetta in the treatment of insulin resistance.
Nevertheless, properties such as short half-life in vivo, poor physical and chemical stabilities, susceptible to degradation by various proteases in vivo are common in the protein/ /polypeptide drugs, such that these drugs often require multiple injections in a day, bring patients lots of pain and inconvenience. PEGylation emerged in 1970s has been proven to be a technology suitable for the field of the current administration of proteins/polypeptides. However, after being modified simply using PEG, the activities of drugs will generally decline.
A series of different methods have been used to modify the structures of GLP-1 analogues, so as to provide a longer duration of action in vivo. CN1384755 discloses novel exendin agonist preparations and their dosing methods, which discloses the compound structure of exenatide and its preparation. CN102532303 discloses the method of synthesizing exenatide conjugated with polyethylene glycol, by conjugating the methoxy polyethylene glycol residue with the amino of lysine residue in the molecule of exenatide or the amino of the histidine residue at the N terminal; CN101980725 discloses the structure of fatty acid-PEG-exenatide, with the modification site of PEG on the N terminal of His; WO2005028516 and WO2012035139 also disclose the structure of fatty acid-PEG-exenatide. Chinese patent CN101215324 discloses a mimetic peptide of short exenatide peptide obtaining from the restructuring of exenatide. Chinese patent CN101125207 reports the PEG modification on Exendin-4. WO99/43708 discloses the GLP-1 (7-35) and GLP-1 (7-36) derivatives with lipophilic substituates linked to the amino acid residues at the C terminal. WO2013059323A1 discloses a PEG-conjugated exenatide and its preparation.
CN102397558 discloses the use of PEG or PEG modification with methyl substitution at the terminal, after substituting some amino acids in exendin-4 for cysteine. CN102421796 discloses that one or more polyethylene glycols polymerize to the cysteine of exendin variants, discloses an exenatide in which one amino acid is substituted with a cysteine, and then modified with polyethylene glycol on the cysteine. CN102827270 discloses an exendin-4-Cys-PEG derivative, specifically introducing one cysteine at the C-terminal of the inactive area of the exenatide molecule, and coupling with maleimido polyethylene glycol, wherein it is terminated with methyl at the polyethylene glycol terminal.
Notwithstanding these efforts in so many aspects have been made, the current existing exendin-4 or its variants and various modifications still possess some drawbacks, including the high dosing frequency when used in vivo, bring patients great burdens on their body, mentality and economy, restricting the compliance of patients, and being incapable of widely application. There remains a great requirement on the active long-acting GLP-1 analogues for diabetic populations, so it is a need to develop new exenatide derivatives, making them with long durations of action, good stabilities, good hypoglycemic effects, while maintaining low toxicities and good activities.
SUMMARY
The present invention is to overcome the drawbacks of the presently disclosed exenatide modifiers GLP-1 receptor, with low binding force and short hypoglycemia duration, thus causing poor effects or frequent injections in clinical use.
It is known to those skilled in the art that, in the bioactive molecule with a conjugated polymeric group, the biological activity of the conjugated biological molecule will gradually decrease exponentially as the molecular weight of the conjugated group increases. It is also known to those skilled in the art that as the molecular weight of the polymeric group increases, the biological half-life and/or plasma half-life and the systematic drug exposure of the conjugated biological molecule will gradually prolong or increase.
It is discovered unexpectedly by those skilled in the present invention that, through the modification of exenatide by those skilled in the present invention, the pharmacokinetical properties have been improved, thus increasing the hypoglycemia duration. And compared with exenatide, the molecules of the present invention still retain most of the activities of GLP-1 receptor agonists, which means that the molecules of the present invention are high in the activity of the GLP-1 receptor agonist, and have long hypoglycemia duration, with a possibility of being drugs with long durations of action, good stabilities, and good hypoglycemic effects in the future clinical applications.

In the third aspect, the present invention provides a composition comprising an exenatide modifier or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and optionally pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.
In the fourth aspect, the present invention provides a use of the above described composition in preparing drugs serving as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, a use in preparing drugs for preventing and/or treating diseases and/or symptoms associated with a low GLP-1 receptor activity, a use in preparing drugs for diseases and/or symptoms associated with glycometabolism, a use in preparing drugs for diabetes, a use in preparing drugs for fatty liver, and a use in preparing drugs for losing weight.
The exenatide modifiers provided in the present invention not only possess higher GLP-1 receptor agonistic activities, but also long durations of hypoglycemia. It is illustrated through the following pharmacological tests.
Each test sample was repectively dissolved in double distilled water to a final concentration of 1.0×10-2mol/L, and stored at 4°C. PC12 cells were cultured in a 25cm2 culture flask placed in the CO2 incubator (37°C, 95% air, 5% CO2), with the culture medium of DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium, pH=7.4, high glucose), in which there were added 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum. The well-grown PC 12 cells were digested with 0.25% pancreatin, the cell concentration being adjusted to 1.0×105 cells/ml, seeded in a 24-well plate. When cells grew to the density of 60-70%, they were washed twice with PBS (Phosphate Buffer Saline) with the addition of PBS containg 1% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) for 1ml each, and the test drugs were respectively divided into 5 gradients of concentration (10-10, 10-9, 10-8, 10-7, 10-6 mol/L) and co-incubated with IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 100µmol/L) for 30min, 3 operations of multiple holes being done for each concentration of the samples. Once the intervention time of drugs end, the cells were collected immediately, suspended with cold PBS, and the cell concentration was adjusted to 1.0×107/ml. One volume of IN HCl was immediately added into 9 volumes of cell suspension, incubated for 10min at room temperature, ultrasonicated with an ultrasonic apparatus for 15s. At 4°C, they were centrifuged for 10min at 1000rpm to remove cell debris. The supernatant was added into 1N NaOH of equal volme with 1N HCl to neutralization (wherein 1N represents one equivalent), the resulting solution being the sample solution containing cAMP, stored at -20°C ready for detection. Non-Interference Protein Assay Kit was employed to detect the total protein concentration in the sample. The content of cAMP in the cell lysate was detected using ELISA kit following the instruction of the kit, and the OD (Optical Density) value was determined at 450nm by the BIO-RAD 680 Microplate Reader. Based on the OD value of the standard, CurveExpert 1.3 software was employed to fit curves and compute the standard curve formula, and calculate the concentration of each sample. Computer programs Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism 5 software were used for data processing and charting to calculate EC50 (half effective concentration, Concentration for 50% of Maximal Effect) of each test drug.

After binding, GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptors (G coupling proteins of β receptor family) activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. GLP-1 receptors of mature pancreatic β cells coupled with Gs, activating the adenylate cyclase and producing cAMP, the latter, coordinated with glucose, stimulating the synthesis and secretion of insulin, stimulating the gene transcription of insulin and the biosynthesis of proinsulin, reducing the glucagon concentration and inhibiting the secretion of glucagon, enhancing the sensitivity of cells on insulin, stimulating the insulin-dependent glycogen synthesis, reducing the postprandial blood sugar concentration. The smaller the EC50 was, indicating the higher drug GLP-1 receptor agonistic activities.
It was shown from the results in Table 1 that, the compounds of the present invention were comparable to exenatide in activity or only slightly decreased, indicating that the modifications on exenatide in the present invention have no influences on the GLP-1 receptor agonistic activities.
Hypoglycemic effects on spontaneous type 2 diabetes db/db mice
C57BL/6db/db9 mice (male) at the age of 5∼6 weeks were purchased from Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University, the experimental animals being feed in the SPF animal houses. The animal houses were well-ventilated, equipped with air conditioners, keeping the temperature at 20∼25°C and the humidity at 40%∼70%, with the ventilation rate of 10∼15 times/h, light and dark each for 12 hours. Experimental animals had free access to food and water, and each mouse was marked with an ear tag. Mice were used in the experiment once a week, with the period of no more than three weeks. After one week acclimation, the capillary blood glucoses at the tail tip of mice were determined by MAJOR glucose meter. 340 mice with blood glucose level greater than 16.7mmol/L were chosen and randomly grouped into 68 groups according to the blood glucose level. The model control group was given 5 mL/kg PBS (pH=7.4) by subcutaneous injection, the positive control group 1 was given Exenatide (10 µg/kg, 5 mL/kg) by subcutaneous injection, the dosing groups were respectively injected compounds 1-15(10 µg/kg, 5 mL/kg) subcutaneously. After administration, the blood glucoses at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 72h were determined by a glucose meter, and all data was input into Graphpad Prism to calculate the mean blood glucose. The maximum hypoglycemic effect (the maximum reduction rate compared with the model group), the maximum hypoglycemic time (the last time point at which the blood glucose decreased significantly compared with the model group), and the area under the curve were calculated.

Synthesis of Target Peptide
1.5g Exendin-4(1-39)-Lys40(Alloc)-NH2 resin was swelled in DMF, into which was then added 3eq solution of Pd (PPh3)4 in CHCl3:AcOH:NMM (18:1:0.5). They were reacted for 2h, then washed with chloroform (6 times, 20ml chloroform for each time), washed with 20% solution of HOAc in DCM (dichloromethane) (6 times, 20ml 20% solution of HOAc in DCM for each time), washed with DCM (6 times, 20ml DCM for each time) and washed with DMF (6 times, 20ml DMF for each time). When it was detected with ninhydrin as positive, 5ml DMF, 640mg compound BP103m72, 150mg HOAT, and 150ul DIC were added and reacted for 4h; and when it was detected with ninhydrin as negative, indicting that the side chain BP103m72 has connected onto Exendin-4(1-39)-Lys40-NH2 resin. The pyrolysis of the resin was carried out by employing 82.5% TFA/5% phenol/5% water/2.5% EDT/5% thioanisole, and then they were precipated with ice-cold methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and washed. Crude products were purified by HPLC to give 48mg target compound.MS(ESI+, m/e): 5252.54[M+H]+.
