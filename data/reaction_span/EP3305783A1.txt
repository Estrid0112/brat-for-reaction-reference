Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), also known as acute myelogenous leukemia, is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated. AML is the most prevalent form of adult acute leukemia, particularly among older adults and is slightly more common in men than women. There is an estimated prevalence of 30,000 cases of AML in the US and 47,000 in the EU.
The incidence of AML increases with age with a median age at diagnosis of 67 years. The global incidence CAGR for AML out to 2013 is 1.4%. An aging population, along with an increased incidence of treatment-related AML in cancer survivors, currently accounting for 10-20% of all AML cases, is expected to drive the incidence of AML. In addition, there is some geographic variation in the incidence of AML. In adults, the highest rates are seen in North America, Europe, and Oceania, while adult AML is rarer in Asia and Latin America.
AML accounts for approximately 1.2% of all cancer deaths. The 5 year survival rates for AML are low, driven by therapy failure and patients relapsing. Among patients <65 the 5 year survival rate is 34.4%, among patients >65 it is only 5%.
The WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia is the current standard for classification of AML and incorporates genetic abnormalities into diagnostic algorithms. This classification is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells under light microscopy and by using cytogenetics and molecular genetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities or genetic changes.
The most commonly used chemotherapeutic compounds for treatment of AML are anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, methotrexate, thiopurines, cytarabine and alkylant agents such as cyclophosphamide. While all of these treatments are known to be toxic and to cause many side effects, there is still a need for new and efficient therapeutic concepts for the treatment of cancer diseases, like AML.
It is an object of the present invention to provide alternatives to known means for treatment of cancer, in particular of leukemia, like e.g. chronic and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The present invention relates to furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivatives or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as defined below and in the claims.
It has been surprisingly found that the furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivatives of the present invention are capable of inhibiting transcription factor STAT5.

Compounds of formula 1 may be administered as the sole pharmaceutical agent or in combination with at least one anticancer agent selected from a group consisting of a JAK inhibitor, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, a FLT3 inhibitor, and a PI3K inhibitor, wherein the pharmaceutical combination causes no unacceptable adverse effects. This combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation, which contains a compound of formula 1 and one or more additional anticancer agents in form of a single pharmaceutical composition, as well as administration of the compound of formula 1 and each additional anticancer agent in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation, i.e. in its own separate pharmaceutical composition. For example, a compound of formula 1 and an anticancer agent may be administered to the patient together in a single oral dosage composition such as a tablet or capsule, or each agent may be administered in separate pharmaceutical compositions.
Where separate pharmaceutical compositions are used, the compound of formula 1 and one or more additional anticancer agents may be administered at essentially the same time (e.g., concurrently) or at separately staggered times (e.g., sequentially).
"Pharmaceutical combination" as used herein means a product that results from the mixing or combining of more than one active ingredient and includes both fixed and non-fixed combinations of the active ingredients.
The term "fixed combination" or "fixed dose" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of formula 1 and a combination partner, i.e. an anticancer agent, are both administered to a patient simultaneously in the form of a single entity or dosage. In other terms: the active ingredients are present in one dosage form, e.g. in one tablet or in one capsule.
The term "non-fixed combination" means that the active ingredients, e.g. a compound of formula 1 and a combination partner, i.e. an anticancer agent, are both administered to a patient as separate entities either simultaneously, concurrently or sequentially with no specific time limits, wherein such administration provides therapeutically effective levels of the two compounds in the body of a mammal or human in need thereof. The latter also applies to cocktail therapy, e.g. the administration of three or more anticancer agents.
Said anticancer agent is as kinase inhibitor selected from a group consisting of a JAK inhibitor, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, a FLT3 inhibitor, and a PI3K inhibitor.
Said pharmaceutical combination may be administered independently at the same time or separately within time intervals, especially here these time intervals allow that the combination partners show a synergistic effect.
The term "synergistic effect" means a therapeutic effect observed following administration of two or more active ingredients (e.g., at least one compound of the invention as STAT5b inhibitor and one or more kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents selected from a group consisting of a JAK inhibitor, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, a FLT3 inhibitor, and a PI3K inhibitor) that is greater than the sum of the therapeutic effects observed following the administration of each single agent.
By "syngergistic increase" is meant the combination of two or more active ingredients (e.g., at least one compound of the invention as STAT5b inhibitor and one or more anticancer agents selected from a group consisting of a JAK inhibitor, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, a FLT3 inhibitor, and a PI3K inhibitor) that results in an increase in cancer cell death that is greater than the sum of the cancer cell death observed following the administration of each individual agent.
By "synergistic decrease" is meant the combination of two or more active ingredients (e.g., at least one compound of the invention as STAT5b inhibitor and one or more anticancer agents selected from the group consisting of a JAK inhibitor, a BCR-ABL inhibitor, a FLT3 inhibitor, and a PI3K inhibitor) that results in a decrease in one or more symptoms of a cancer that is greater than the sum of the decrease in one or more symptoms of the cancer observed following the administration of each individual agent.
In another example of synergy, a therapeutic effect is observed for the combination of two or more active ingredients, wherein one or more of the active ingredients are present at a dose that is normally non-therapeutic. In another example of synergy, the combination of two or more active ingredients results in an unexpected decrease in toxicity (i.e., a level of toxicity that is less than the sum of the toxicity observed following administration of the single agents). The term "STAT5b inhibitor" means any active ingredient that binds STAT5b and inhibits a biological activity (e.g., kinase activity) of STAT5b or inhibits dimerization of two STAT5bs. The term "inhibits" and its grammatical conjugations, such as "inhibitory", is not intended to require complete inhibition in Stat5b activity. Such reduction is preferably by at least about 50%, at least about 75%, at least about 90%, and more preferably by at least about 95% of the activity of the molecule in the absence of the inhibitory effect, e.g., in the absence of an inhibitor. Most preferably, the term refers to an observable or measurable reduction in activity. In treatment scenarios, preferably the inhibition is sufficient to produce a therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit in the condition being treated. The phrase "does not inhibit" and its grammatical conjugations do not require a complete lack of effect on the activity. For example, it refers to situations where there is less than about 20%, less than about 10%, and preferably less than about 5% of reduction in kinase activity in the presence of an inhibitor such as a compound of the invention.
"JAK (Janus Kinase) inhibitor" means any active ingredient that binds Janus kinase and inhibits a biological activity (e.g., kinase activity) thereof.

The present invention is also directed to a method for treating cancer, wherein a patient in need of such therapy is administered a therapeutically effective dose of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. Preferably, the cancer is selected from leukemia, more preferably the cancer is acute myeloid leukemia.
The furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivatives of the invention are administered preferably at an effective dose. An "effective dose" is the dose of a furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivative that upon administration to a patient yields a measurable therapeutic effect with regard to the disease of interest. In the present invention an effective dose is the dose of a furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivative that upon administration to a patient yields a therapeutic effect with regard to at least one disease related symptom in a patient or patients suffering from said disease.

In particular, the furazan-3-carboxylic acid derivative can be administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg/d to 400 mg/kg/d, preferably of 20 mg/kg/d to 150 mg/kg/d. In any event, the physician or the skilled person will be able to determine the actual dose which will be suitable for an individual patient, which is likely to vary with the age, weight, sex, and concomitant illnesses such as renal or hepatic dysfunction and response of the particular patient to be treated. The above mentioned dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are appropriate, and such are within the scope of the invention.

EXAMPLES:
Cytokines and growth factors induce proliferation and differentiation of healthy cells mediated by intracellular phosphorylation cascades. In contrast, cytokine-independent proliferation is a typical molecular characteristic of cancer cells. The pathological cell growth is evoked by genomic DNA mutations, which alter the expression or the activity of receptor tyrosine kinases or of downstream protein kinases. As a consequence, intracellular signaling proteins are constitutively activated. Kinase inhibitors have been developed as a new option for the treatment of cancer during the past decade. These drugs have revolutionized the therapy of certain neoplastic diseases, e.g. chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which inhibitors of the kinase BCR/ABL like imatinib have increased patient survival rates impressively. Unfortunately, mutations in the target kinases can abolish the anti-cancer effects of kinase inhibitors and lead to resistant cancer cell lines. Such resistances could be counter-acted pharmacologically, if intracellular signaling was blocked downstream of kinases, e.g. at the level of transcription factors.
STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription) are transcription factors representing central hubs in the signaling of numerous cancer cell types. For example, in >95% of CML patients and >60% of patients suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) STAT5 has been identified as the direct downstream target of mutated kinases. In these cases of CML and AML, STAT5 proteins are constitutively activated and therefore targeting STAT5 could be a strategy to block cytokine-independent cancer cell amplification while avoiding the appearance of resistance mutations in kinases.
Over the recent years our group has developed methodologies for the sensitive and site-directed detection of protein-binding molecular fragments based on reversible (dynamic) ligation reactions on protein surfaces. The method is able to distinguish enhancing, cooperatively binding fragments, from inhibitory, competitive binders. It has been applied to protein phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) demonstrating that fragments that enhance the cleavage of the generic PTP substrate 4-formyl-phenyl phosphate 1 target secondary binding sites of these proteins and thus were successful starting points to construct specific inhibitors for these enzyme. In this contribution, we extent this methodology from PTPs toward phosphotyrosine binding domains, exemplified by the SH2-domain of STAT5 (Figure 1) reporting the discovery of novel phosphotyrosine mimetic fragments as specific inhibitors of STAT5 and their application in a cellular model of AML.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
STAT5 is expressed in two closely related forms, STAT5a (793 amino acids) and STAT5b (786 amino acids), showing 94% identity of amino acid sequence. The protein associates to the intracellular domains of activated cytokine receptors and becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine 694. Phosphorylated STAT5 (p-STAT5) dimerizes via a Src-homology type 2 (SH2) phosphotyrosine recognition domain and translocates into the cell nucleus. There, p-STAT5 dimers bind to their genomic promoter sequence inducing the transcription of their target genes. STAT proteins have been described as difficult pharmacological targets. While highly potent peptide ligands have been reported for the STAT-SH2 domains, these phosphopeptide mimetics usually fail to provide significant cellular activity. Several small molecule inhibitors of STAT5 have been reported, the most potent molecules are based on salicylic acid and phenyl-di-phosphate as phosphotyrosine mimetics. Binding of fragments to the STAT5-SH2 domain was recorded by measuring the fluorescence polarization of a high-affinity carboxyfluoresceine-labeled phosphotyrosine octapeptide (2) possessing a KD of 55 nM, which we had developed earlier from a phosphopeptide screen of reported STAT5 recognition sites. The ChemBioNet fragment collection composed in accordance with the substructure composition of the World Drug Index (WDI) was screened both for enhancing and inhibiting fragments of the phosphopeptide-STAT5 interaction. Although several primary amines were identified as enhancing fragments, far stronger effects were observed for inhibitory fragments that were able to block the interaction of the high-affinity probe with and without the electrophilic phosphotyrosine mimic (1).
One fragment, the 4-(1 H-tetrazol-1-yl-methyl-amino)-furazan-3-carboxylic acid (3) displayed a ligand efficiency of 2.23 kJ/mol per non-hydrogen atom, significantly higher than that of the phosphotyrosine mimetic (1), the nanomolar phosphopeptide (2) and all reported STAT5 inhibitors. Indeed ligands with such a high binding efficiency are rather found for enzymatic binding pockets than for protein-protein interaction sites. To rationalize this surprising observation, potential binding modes of the phosphotyrosine and the fragment hit (3) were considered using the published crystal structure of STAT5 (Figure 2). The phosphotyrosine binding site in the STAT5-SH2 domain is shallow compared to the deeper binding pockets of PTP, coordinating the tyrosine phosphate by only two H-bonding amino acid residues, Arg618 and Ser622. As a result, the benzene ring of the ligand is not buried in a cavity like in the case of PTPs but rather exposed to the solvent at the protein surface.
Binding of the furazan-carboxylate (3) is mediated by the Coulomb interaction between the carboxylate anion of (3) and the cation of protonated Arg618 and three essential H-bonds involving Arg618 and Ser 622. Several additional H-bonds are predicted by the binding model, between the 4-amino group of (3) and the carbonyl of Asn642, the tetrazole ring of the ligand and the amide-NH2 of Asn642, and an internal H-bond within the ligand that might stabilize the binding conformation of the ligand. Derivatives of fragment (3) were synthesized and tested in order to investigate structure-activity relations and, thus, to challenge and substantiate the binding hypothesis (Tables 1,2). The 4-amino-furazan-3-carboxylate fragment (4), which was prepared from ethyl 2-cyano acetate in two steps (Scheme 1), was inactive even at mM concentrations. The same was observed for the 1 H-tetrazole (5).<img> id-imgb0024.tif </img><img> id-imgb0025.tif </img>Reaction conditions: a) NaNO2, H3PO4, H2O/EtOH, 10 °C, 12 h. b) NaOH, KOH, NH2OH*HCl, HCl, 66 %.c) R1OH, H2SO4, reflux, 12 h, 90-95 %.d) A (1.0 eq.), B (2.0 eq.), C (1.5 eq.), MeCN, AcOH, rt, 16 h.
Combinations of one 4-amino furazan fragment A with various heterocycles were prepared in a three-component reaction with formaldehyde B and the tetrazole component C. Ester derivatives of (3) were prepared using the same synthetic approach with furazan carboxylate esters as starting materials. Methyl ester (6) was active with a significant reduction of the KD value to 76µM, the n-butyl ester (7) was further deactivated with 145 µM affinity. On the contrary, the 1-acetoxy-1-ethyl carboxylate (15) exhibited a lower KD of 14 µM. Next, variations of the furazan and of the linker motif between the two heterocycles were investigated. Replacement of the oxygen in the furazan ring by sulfur yielded the inactive 1, 2, 5-thiadiazole (8).

Numerous variations of the tetrazole part of the molecule were conducted. While the 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl (9), the 1,2,4-triazol-1-yl (10), the pyridin-2-yl (11), and the 1,2,3-benzotriazol-1-yl (12) were completely inactive, the pyrazol-1-yl derivative (13) was active in the micromolar range with a KD of 122 µM. Replacement of the aminomethylene bridge by an acetamide linkage (14) abolished the activity as well. Interestingly, the 5-position of the tetrazol ring in (3) could be substituted with a phenyl ring retaining the activity toward STAT5 both for the free acid (16, 1.4µM) and for the methyl ester (17, 37µM) (Table 2). Most of the derivatives substituted at the phenyl ring in p- or m-position displayed improved binding to the SH2 domain of STAT5, submicromolar affinities were found for the m-trifluoromethyl- (21, 0.86µM), the m-fluoro- (27, 0.62µM) and the biphenyl derivatives (29, 0.8µM).
Specificity of fragment (3) was investigated both with respect to the closely related SH2 domain of STAT3 and to the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2. No inhibition of SHP2 and no binding of to the SH2 domain of STAT3 were detected at concentrations up to 1mM. Sequence alignment of the SH2 domains of STAT3 and 5 revealed that asparagine Asn642, the amino acid being crucial for the hydrogen bond network depicted in Figure 2, is only present in STAT5-SH2, while Arg618 and Ser622 are retained in STAT3-SH2, thereby explaining the surprisingly high specificity of fragment (3).
Biological Evaluation
Having established the structure-activity relations of the novel fragment inhibitors of STAT5, the biological activity was studied in a cellular disease model. For the purpose, the murine pro-B-cell line BaF3 was used stably transfected with the full-length cDNA sequence of the human FLT3 receptor, carrying an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation of 10 amino acids (Mizuki et al.: Flt3 mutations from patients with acute myeloid leukemia induce transformation of 32D cells mediated by the Ras and STAT5 pathways. Blood 2000, 96, 3907-3914). By this mutation the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 loses its inhibitory interaction with the two adjacent tyrosine kinase domains enabling their auto-phosphorylation. In consequence, in the FLT3-ITD transfected cells STAT5 is constitutively phosphorylated and does not require the cytokine interleukin-3 for activation. As the FLT3-ITD mutation is found in up to 35 % of all patients suffering from AML, thus, it can be considered as a relevant model for this disease (see e.g. Kindler et al: FLT3 as a therapeutic target in AML: still challenging after all these years. Blood 2010, 116, 5089-5102).
At first, the ligand-mediated inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation at conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr694 and Tyr699) was investigated, which is initiated by the binding of the SH2 domain to phosphorylated cell surface receptors. Compounds (3), (6), (15) and (30) were dissolved in DMSO (20mM) and added to BaF3/FLT3-ITD cells suspended in RPMI-medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. After 6 h cells were harvested to determine the level of STAT5 phosphorylation using phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies (Figure 4A-B). The strongest inhibitory effect was observed for the methyl ester fragment (6) with a clear reduction of STAT5 phosphorylation already at a concentration of 25µM and with an IC50 value of 44.2µM. A similar effect was observed for the acetoxy-ethyl-carboxylate (15) displaying an IC50 of 68.9µM. (Figure 4C, F)
Both compounds (6) and (15) had no effect on the overall the expression of endogenous STAT5. In contrast, the phosphorylation of STAT5 was inhibited by the free acid fragment only with an IC50 value of >100 µM (see Figure S6F). We suspected that the low cellular activity of (3) is due to the low cellular uptake of this compound, which might be hampered by its high polarity (clogP = 1.11). This consideration was substantiated by the significantly more active nonpolar derivatives (6) and (15), which are likely to be cleaved enzymatically by intracellular esterases and thus act as prodrugs. The selectivity of compounds (6) and (15) in cells were investigated, too, and both showed only negligible effects on STAT3 phosphorylation and on endogenous STAT3 expression (see Figure S7A, B), suggesting that the inhibitory effects were STAT5-specific in cells, too.
The highest cellular activity was found for compound (30), which was the first free acid fragment showing strong inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation with an IC50 of 30.8µM (Figure 5A) and displayed strongly improved solubility compared to the 5-aryl-substituted tetrazole. Compound (30) shows a clear reduction on STAT5 phosphorylation at 50µM in both BaF3/FLT3-ITD and K562 cells after 6 h of incubation. (Figure 7A, B). Next, the functional effects of STAT5 inhibitors (6) and (15) on cellular transcription were investigated. For the purpose, the expression of three transcriptional targets of STAT5, namely Pim1 kinase, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xl, which play essential roles in cell cycle progression and survival, was monitored by Western Blotting (Figure 6A, B). Treatment of BaF3/FLT-ITD cells with (6) or (15) resulted in a dose dependent reduction of Pim1, cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL expression after 6 h, indicating the disruption of STAT5 activation and the abolishment of the transcriptional activity of STAT5.
Having proven the functional inhibition of STAT5 as a transcription factor, the effect of STAT5 inhibitors on the proliferation of cancer cells carrying the common FLT3-ITD mutation was investigated. Cells were incubated for 48 h and cell proliferation was quantified by the Alamar blue assay (Figure 5). Both compounds, methyl ester (6) and prodrug (15) showed a clear dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation. For comparison, we have tested both compounds on non-STAT5-dependent cell lines and the cytotoxicity effect were negligible up to 500µM. (Figure S9).
As an additional confirmation for the mode of action of the STAT5-binding fragments, we finally investigated their potential to interfere directly with the binding of phosphorylated STAT5 dimers to the target DNA sequences of the transcription factor. For the purpose, phosphorylated STAT5 dimers were extracted from nuclei of BaF3/FLT3-ITD cells were incubated with respective compounds for 1 h at room temperature and eventually added to the microtiter plate wells coated with target DNA. STAT5 ligands added to this cell-free assay detecting the formation of protein-dimer-DNA complexes did not have to cross a cell membrane and accordingly in this assay fragment (3) was a more potent inhibitor than compounds (15) and (6), respectively, corresponding to the affinity ranking in the monomer binding assay. Same phenomenon was observed in EMSA, indicating the inhibition effect of fragment (3) on STAT5 dimer formation thereafter affects the STAT5 DNA-binding activity. (Figure 6C, D)

Besides the Biotage® Isolera™ Spektra One was used for regular flash purifications with pre-pack flash chromatography cartrigdes from Biotage® employing individual gradients derived from analytical runs or thin layer chromatography (TLC). HRMS measurements were conducted with an Agilent 6210 ESI-TOF mass spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra (1H and 13C NMR) were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 300 MHz and 500 MHz instrument and chemical shifts (δ) were measured in parts per million (ppm). Coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hertz (Hz). The following abbreviations are used to describe peak patterns when appropriate: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quadruplet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). The Biotage® Initator+ system was used for rapid microwave-assisted organic synthesis.

Molecular Docking
The homology model of human STAT5b based on the amino acid sequence of human STAT5a has been described previously. In order to rationalize the binding of the synthesized compounds in the active site of HuSTAT5b model, docking calculations were performed using Surflex-Dock interfaced within Sybyl-X 1.3. The 20 resulting docking conformations were ranked according to the CScore and checked visually in order to choose the most favorable binding conformation.
Expression of STAT5b
The clone for Stat5b expression was kindly provided by Thorsten Berg (MPI, Martinsried). Expression of that truncated version of Stat5b (aa 136-703) cloned into a modified pQE70, with N-terminal MBP-tag and C-terminal His-tag was conducted on autoinduction medium (overnight express / Novagen). Cells were grown to an optical density (O.D.) of 0.3 at 37 °C, then the temperature was reduced to 20 °C for further 48 h of expression.Comparable soluble expression levels were obtained with Rosetta2 (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) pLysS (both Novagen). The protein was purified by Ni- chelating chromatography followed by gel filtration (Superdex 200/10 mM HEPES pH 7.8, 100mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol). A yield of 15 mg MBP-Stat5b-His per liter of culture was obtained and aliquots (200 µl of 3.2 mg/ml) were quick-frozen and stored at -80 °C, ready for use.
High-Throughput Screening and Fluorescence Polarization Assays
17000 compounds from the (FMP) ChemBioNet library were tested in a competitive-based fluorescence polarization (FP) assay to investigate the ability of compounds to bind to STAT5b-SH2 domain by displacing respective fluorophore-labeled peptides (5-carboxyfluorescein-GY (PO3H2) LSLPPW-NH2). The peptide purity was >95% and the screening were performed at room temperature. The final concentration of buffer components used was 10mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1mM EDTA, 0.1% Igepal CA-630, 50mM NaCl, and 5% DMSO. The final concentration of protein used was at 65nM which correspond to the dissociation constants (Kd) for the individual protein-peptide interactions in assay buffer. The protein was first added to the black 384 well plate (Corning 3676) followed by test compounds and fluorophore-labeled peptide. The plates were centrifuged, and measured using Safire2 well plate reader (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) after 15 minutes incubation at room temperature. For specificity analysis, FP assay was conducted with 100nM GST-tagged, full length human STAT3 protein (SignalChem, Richmond, BC, Canada) and 10nM fluorophore-labeled peptides (5-carboxyfluorescein-GY (PO3H2) LPQTV-NH2). The assay buffer contains 50mM NaCl, 10mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1mM EDTA, 0.01% Triton-X100 and 2mM dithiothreitol). The test compounds were serial diluted and incubated with STAT3 protein at room temperature for 1 hour followed by 10nM of fluorophore labeled peptide. Mixture was centrifuged and incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature before measurement were examined using Safire2. For the analysis of the data GraphPad Prism 5 was used.
