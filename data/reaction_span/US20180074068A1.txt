BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
This invention generally relates to fluorescent probes that take advantage of the reactivity of H2S and H2Sn species. These probes represent significant progress in the field, as they have both been successfully applied in the visualization of both exogenous and endogenous H2S and H2Sn in living cells.
Discussion of the Related Art
As a family, reactive sulfur species are sulfur-containing molecules that play a regulatory role in biological systems. Reactive sulfur species include biothiols and other s-modified protein cysteine adducts along with hydrogen sulfide and sulfane sulfur moieties such as persulfides, and polysulfides. Endogenous H2Sn may also be generated from H2S upon reacting with reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as ClO−. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), the enzymes responsible for H2S biosynthesis, were found to also produce persulfides, which could further be converted to H2Sn. H2S can also react with other sulfane sulfurs, such as S8, to form H2Sn.
The significance of H2Sn in redox biology has only recently been recognized, along with further research working to uncover additional biological mechanisms. As a general statement, the trend in the field currently suggests that H2Sn comprises signaling molecules that activate ion channels, transcription factors, and tumor suppressors with higher potency than H2S. Additionally, physiological activities that have been attributed to being meditated by H2S have also been shown to be meditated by H2Sn. With one such example being S-sulfhydration, wherein a posttranslational modification is the result of H2S activity. But, it was also observed that H2Sn are more effective than H2S in S-sulfhydration. As such a greater understanding of the mechanisms of action governing sulfur species has become an active area of research.
Despite the increased interest in this area of research, there still remain many fundamental questions regarding the production and the mechanism of action of reactive sulfur species. Traditional methods for detecting sulfur species in a sample resulted in suspending a sample in a solution and measuring the UV/Vis absorption bands at 290-300 nm and 370 nm to determine the presence of H2Sn. However, this method has low sensitivity and is not applicable for biological detections. Fluorescence assays could be useful because of their high sensitivity and spatial/temporal resolution capability. Initial attempts at developing similar fluorescent probes employed a 2-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoic ester template to trap H2Sn and allowed for an intramolecular cyclization to release a fluorophore. Other attempts adopted similar chemical templates, but also introduced new drawbacks.

General Description
The general usefulness of the disclosed invention lies in the selective detection of H2S and H2Sn species either together or individually in living cells. The disclosed probes rely on the reactivity of sulfur species in said living cells. H2Sn are reactive and labile, additionally they often exist as a thiosulfoxide tautomer. Such properties provide very highly reactive intermediates from which the sulfur atom can be readily reacted with nucleophilic groups. This reactivity allows the disclosed probes to take advantage of specific chemistry and as a result be selective for specific sulfur species.
One of the benefits of the several embodiments disclosed herein is that they do not interfere with the other biologically relevant sulfur species such as cysteine, glutathione, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfate. As such, aspects of the invention provide for either a singular or dual reactive fluorescent probe for sensing and imaging H2Sn or H2S moieties to include, a nucleophile, a fluorophore, and a modified fluorophore attached via a linker. Using various embodiments of the invention, the concentration of both hydrogen sulfide and/or hydrogen polysulfides can be determined by their fluorescence signal.
More notably, the disclosed methods don't require the destruction of living tissues, thus allowing for the fluorescence and detection of H2Sn or H2S to occur in living cells and tissues. Additionally, the disclosed probes are easy to use along with being safe and relatively low in toxicity. The above mentioned qualities allow for the disclosed invention to have biochemical and biomedical research applications that include clinical and drug development assays.
The compounds disclosed herein can thus be used in real time imaging of H2Sn or H2S in living cells. Along with being utilized in various biomedical applications, such compounds enable the study of, for example, the role of endogenously produced H2Sn or H2S in living cellular models. Additionally, the disclosed probes can be used in clinical and drug-development assays by providing rapid method to assess the level of H2Sn or H2S within a given model.
Specific Description
The concept underpinning of the PSP probes is illustrated in FIG. 1, wherein thioesters can further react with an H2Sn species to activate the compound and allow for fluorescence. To demonstrate the efficiency of PSP probes in detecting H2Sn concentration, varying concentrations of Na2S2 were tested with select fluorescence probes as shown by FIG. 2. The fluorescence intensity increased linearly with the concentration of Na2S2 changed up to 25 μM, and, thereafter reached a steady state. It should be noted that the reaction that yields fluorescence is slower and tends to yield less fluorescence when the H2Sn concentration is lower. But, at higher loads the fluorescence of the compound can be easily detected. As seen in FIG. 3, the fluorescent intensity of 10 μM PSP-3 in the presence of various sulfur species: (1) probe alone; (2) 100 μM Hcy; (3) 100 μM GSSG; (4) 200 μM Na2S; (5) 100 μM Na2S2O3; (6) 100 μM Na2SO3; (7) 100 μM Na2SO4; (8) 100 μM CH3SSSCH3; (9) 50 μM Na2S2; (10) 50 μM Na2S4. The graph labeled B shows the Fluorescence intensity of PSP-3 (10 μM) in the presence of selected reactive sulfur species with or without H2S. The data shows the superior selectivity of the PSP probes while still demonstrating that there is little to no reactivity with biothiols or other sulfur species under physiological concentrations.
In one embodiment of the disclosed invention, the reactive groups have been designed to only react with H2Sn and not react with other sulfur species, especially biothiols. From a chemistry stand point, H2Sn derivatives are quite different from thiols or H2S. The estimated pKa values of H2Sn are in the range of 3 to 5. By comparison the pKa value for H2S and biothiols are in the range of 7 to 9.2. As such, at a physiological pH, H2Sn are expected to be anionic species and as such, will function as more reactive nucleophiles than biothiols and H2S as a result of the alpha effect.
In another embodiment the PSP probes can have been designed to visuals exogenous sulfur species in a living system. As seen in FIG. 4, (a) HeLa, (b) RAW264.7, and (c) Vero cells were incubated in the presence of a PSP at varying concentrations to demonstrate that the compounds don't induce cytotoxicity in the treated cells. Additionally, the selectivity of the probes can be seen in FIG. 5. The figure shows the probe in the presence of H2Sn, the image of exogenous H2Sn in HeLa (a-c), RAW264.7 (d-f), and Vero (g-l) cells. The selected cells where incubated in the probe (5 μM) for 25 min, then washed and subjected to different treatments that included treating the cells with 30 μM of Na2S2 (b,e,h) and cells treated with 30 μM of Na2S4 (c,f,i) along with the controls with nothing added (a,d,g). Other biologically relevant sulfur species that can be detected, including cysteine, glutathione, homocysteine, oxidized glutathione, H2S, thiosulfate, sulfite and sulfate, show little to no significant fluorescence. These results demonstrate good selectivity of PSP probe for the desired target.
In another embodiment of the disclosed invention, the fluorescence probe such as DDP was designed to react and distinguish between H2Sn and H2S. In the design of such a probe, four factors were considered. The first being the selection of a fluorophore, coumarin and rhodol were selected as two fluorophores due to their excellent solubility, high quantum yields, and well-separated maximum emission wavelengths (ca. 445 nm for coumarin and ca. 542 nm for rhodol). As such, dual-color imaging of H2S and H2Sn from different emission channels was possible. The second factor is the selection of a linker. To that end, a rigid piperazine linker was used to bridge the two fluorophores and provide an advantage for Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in the coumarin-rhodol scaffold, which prevents the π-π stacking between dyes. The third factor is the azidation of coumarin and phenyl 2-(benzoylthio)benzoate-protected rhodol to effectively quench the fluorescence of the probe via the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect and the intramolecular spirocyclization, respectively. The fourth and final factor, is the azide and phenyl 2-(benzoylthio)benzoate moieties provide selective reaction sites for H2S and H2Sn.
The fluorescence turn-on mechanism of DDP-1 is shown in FIG. 6. When the probe is treated with H2Sn, phenyl 2-(benzoylthio)benzoate preferably reacted to release the fluorescence of rhodol. Even if the azide group is partially reduced by H2Sn to form a small amount of 3, it should not affect the fluorescence emission channel due to FRET between the two fluorophores. Overall the reaction with H2Sn should only produce green fluorescence of rhodol. In contrast, the reaction between DDP-1 and H2S is more complicated. Previous results have demonstrated that H2S cannot turn on phenyl 2-(benzoylthio)benzoate-based fluorophore. Therefore, H2S would preferably react with the azide moiety to produce 2 and release blue fluorescence of coumarin. It should be noted that recent studies demonstrated that the reaction of H2S with azides led to the formation of H2Sn. Therefore, 3 would also be formed in this process, which should exhibit green fluorescence of rhodol because of FRET. However, less than 0.5 equivalent of H2Sn are generated from the reaction of 1 equivalent of H2S and the azide. Moreover, the reaction with phenyl 2-(benzoylthio)benzoate consumes at least 2 equivalent of H2Sn. Therefore, only a small amount of 3 would be produced during this process. Overall the reaction between DDP-1 and H2S should produce the emission signals of both coumarin (major) and rhodol (minor).
The sensitivity of the DDP H2S and H2Sn using varied concentrations of Na2S or Na2S2 (0 to 150 μm). FIG. 7 shows the increase in fluorescence intensity (λex=360 nm) with the gradual increase of Na2S or Na2S2 concentrations was observed. For H2S, the fluorescence intensity at 452 nm increased linearly with Na2S concentration from 0 to 20 μm. The fluorescence intensity at 542 nm increased linearly with Na2S in the concentration range of 0 to 40 μm. The detection limits (S/N=3) were 100 nm and 150 nm for H2S, corresponding emission at 452 and 542 nm. The fluorescence intensity at 542 nm increased linearly with Na2S2 concentrations from 0 to 20 μm. The detection limit was calculated to be 24 nm. As a result, the DDP probes displayed much higher sensitivity to H2Sn than H2S, and that pH has an effect on the reactivity. With probe operating more effectively at neutral to basic pH's.
Given the dual reactive nature of the DDP probe there was a need for establish a meaningful responses when H2S and H2Sn co-exist. To this end, fluorescence changes of varying Na2S2/Na2S mixture solutions where examined, while the total sulfur concentration was fixed in samples (200 μm). As H2S is a much more stable species than H2Sn and the concentration of H2S is likely to be higher than H2Sn in biological systems, we varied [H2S2]/[H2S] ratios from 0 to 1. The fluorescence signals of these solutions were measured by the probe. As shown in FIG. 8 the increases of [H2S2]/[H2S] ratios, the emission at 452 nm decreased with a concurrent increase at 542 nm. The F542 nm/F452 nm ratios increased linearly with [H2S2]/[H2S] ratios in the range of 0 to 0.176. Showing that the DDP probe could be used for the ratiometric detection of relative H2Sn and H2S concentrations when they coexist.
In another embodiment the DDP probes has been designed to visuals exogenous sulfur species in a living system. As seen in FIG. 9, HeLa cells were incubated in the presence of a DDP probe at varying concentrations to demonstrate that the compounds don't induce cytotoxicity in the treated cells. Additionally, the selectivity of the probes can be seen in FIG. 10. The figure shows the probe in the presence of H2Sn and H2S, in HeLa cells. The probe (20 μm) was applied to the cells for 30 minutes, after which the extracellular probe was washed off and only a weak fluorescence was observed. When cells were treated with Na2S (100 μm), an apparent fluorescence enhancement was detected in the blue and green channel. When cells were treated with Na2S2 or in situ generated H2Sn, the fluorescence signals in the blue channel decreased with a coinstantaneous increase in the green channel. These results demonstrate that DDP probes where could be used for the detection of H2S and H2Sn from distinct emission channels in cells. Additionally, the cell viability assay implied that DDP has low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility
Both the PSP and DDP-1 probes are designed with a fluorophore attached via a linker or a substituted aryl a group leading to a fluorophore or modified fluorophore group. The electrophile is positioned suitably for cyclization reaction, to release the fluorophore and produce either a self-quenching reaction with via a reduction leading to a blue florescence via a reduction of the reactive group on the fluorophores. An alternative reaction can occur at the sulfur leading a systematic collapse and release of the fluorophores from the base structure.
The mechanisms of action of these probes have been fine tuned to detect the present of H2Sn or H2S. When the probe is treated with a source of H2Sn. the reaction occurs that will release a fluorophore.
The fluorescence properties of the probes disclosed herein were tested in aqueous PBS buffer solution (pH 7.4). The thioester group of PSP probes is used to trap H2Sn in the desired target. The resulting intermediate adducts undergo a fast intermolecular cyclization to release strong fluorescent molecules, as well as benzodithiolone.

Preparation of Solutions and Fluorescence Measurements
The stock solutions of PSP 1-3 or DDP-1 (1 mM) were prepared in DMSO, respectively. The solutions of various testing species were prepared from cysteine (Cys), GSH, homocysteine (Hcy), glutathione disulfide (GSSG), Na2S.9H2O, Na2S2O3, Na2SO3, Na2SO4, Na2S2, Na2S4 in 50 mM PBS buffer. The stock solution of cetrimonium bromide (CTAB, 5 mM) was prepared in EtOH. The stock solution of CH3SSSCH3 (10 mM) was prepared in CH3CN. The stock solution of S8 (200 mM) was prepared in CH2Cl2, and then used EtOH to dilute this solution, to get 10 mM the stock solution of S8 in EtOH. All of the test solution needs to be freshly prepared.
Unless otherwise noted, all the measurements were carried out for 30 min at room temperature in 50 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4) with 100 μM CTAB according to the following procedure. In a test tube, 3 mL of 50 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4) and 80 μL of the stock solution of CTAB were mixed, followed by the addition of a requisite volume of testing species sample solution. The final volume of the reaction solution was adjusted to 3.96 mL with 50 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Then 40 μL of the stock solution of PSP 1-3 or DDP-1 (10 μM) was added. After mixing and then standing for 30 min at room temperature, a 3.5-mL portion of the reaction solution was transferred into a 1-cm quartz cell to measure fluorescence with λex=490 nm. In the meantime, a blank solution containing no testing species sample was prepared and measured under the same conditions for comparison.
Preparation of ROS Solutions
The concentration of H2O2 was determined using the absorption at 240 nm (ϵ=43.6 M−1 cm−1). The concentration of ClO− was determined using the absorption at 292 nm (ϵ=360 M−1 cm−1). Superoxide solution (O2−) was prepared by adding KO2 (1 mg) to dry dimethyl sulfoxide (1 mL) and stirring vigorously for 10 min. Hydroxy radical (.OH) was generated in situ by addition of FeSO4 stock solution into a solution containing excess H2O2 through Fenton chemistry. Final concentration of H2O2 was 200 μM. Final concentration of ferrous ion was 50 μM. Singlet oxygen (IO2) was generated in situ by addition of the hypochlorite stock solution into a solution containing excess of H2O2. Final concentration of H2O2 was 200 μM. Final concentration of ClO− was 50 μM.
Quantum Yields
The quantum yield of the compounds in PBS buffer was calculated according to the equation:
<in-line-formulae>Φsample=Φstandard×(Isample/Istandard)×(Astandard/Asample)×(nsample/nstandard)2 </in-line-formulae>
wherein, Φ denotes the quantum yield; I denotes the area under the fluorescence band; A denotes the absorbance at the excitation wavelength; n denotes the refractive index of the solvent.
For quantum yield of PSP1-3, quantum yield was determined using fluorescein as a standard by comparing the area under the corrected emission spectrum of the test sample with that of a solution of fluorescein excited at 490 nm in 0.1 N NaOH, which has a quantum efficiency of 0.85 according to the literature (H. Sunahara, Y. Urano, H. Kojima, T. Nagano, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2007, 129, 5597-5604.).
Cell Viability Assay
HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37° C. under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The cells were then inoculated in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. DDP-1 in FBS-free medium were administered and cultured for 6 h. The cell viability was measured by cell counter kit (CCK)-8. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader. Optical density (OD) of the 9 wells in the indicated groups was used to calculate percentage of cell viability according to the formula below:
<in-line-formulae>Percentage of cell viability=OD treatment group/OD control group×100%</in-line-formulae>
Cell Culture and Fluorescence Imaging

Before use, the adherent cells were washed one time with FBS-free DMEM. For intracellular H2Sn imaging, the cells were incubated with 5 μM the selected probe in FBS-free DMEM at 37° C. for 25 min. After removal of excess probe and washed with PBS (pH 7.4), the cells were incubated with 30 μM Na2S2 or 30 μM Na2S4 at room temperature for 20 min in PBS buffer (pH 7.4, containing 100 μM CTAB). Cell imaging was carried out after removal of the culture solution. For images of CSE-overexpressed COS7 cells.
For the imaging of D-Cys stimulated endogenous H2Sn, the cells were incubated with 5 μM PSP-3 in FBS-free DMEM at 37° C. for 25 min. After removal of excess probe and washed with PBS (pH 7.4), the cells were incubated with 30 μM or 1 mM D-Cys at 37° C. for 30 min, after removal of the culture solution and use PBS buffer (pH 7.4, containing 100 μM CTAB) to further incubate at room temperature for 20 min. Cell imaging was carried out after removal of the culture solution.
