BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
One embodiment of the present invention relates to an organic compound, a light-emitting element, a light-emitting device, an electronic device, and a lighting device. Note that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited thereto. That is, one embodiment of the present invention relates to an object, a method, a manufacturing method, or a driving method. One embodiment of the present invention relates to a process, a machine, manufacture, or a composition of matter. Specific examples include a semiconductor device, a display device, a liquid crystal display device, and the like.
2. Description of the Related Art
A light-emitting element including an electroluminescent (EL) layer between a pair of electrodes (also referred to as an organic EL element) has characteristics such as thinness, light weight, high-speed response to input signals, and low power consumption; thus, a display including such a light-emitting element has attracted attention as a next-generation flat panel display.
In a light-emitting element, voltage application between a pair of electrodes causes, in an EL layer, recombination of electrons and holes injected from the electrodes, which brings a light-emitting substance (organic compound) contained in the EL layer into an excited state. Light is emitted when the light-emitting substance returns to the ground state from the excited state. The excited state can be a singlet excited state (S*) and a triplet excited state (T'). Light emission from a singlet excited state is referred to as fluorescence, and light emission from a triplet excited state is referred to as phosphorescence. The statistical generation ratio thereof in the light-emitting element is considered to be S*:T*=1:3. Since the spectrum of light emitted from a light-emitting substance depends on the light-emitting substance, the use of different types of organic compounds as light-emitting substances makes it possible to obtain light-emitting elements which exhibit various colors.
In order to improve element characteristics of such a light-emitting element, improvement of an element structure, development of a material, and the like have been actively carried out (see Patent Document 1, for example).

Embodiment 2
In this embodiment, a light-emitting element including any of the organic compounds described in Embodiment 1 is described with reference to FIGS. 1A to 1D.
<<Basic Structure of Light-Emitting Element>>
A basic structure of a light-emitting element will be described. FIG. 1A illustrates a light-emitting element including, between a pair of electrodes, an EL layer having a light-emitting layer. Specifically, an EL layer 103 is provided between a first electrode 101 and a second electrode 102.
FIG. 1B illustrates a light-emitting element that has a stacked-layer structure (tandem structure) in which a plurality of EL layers (two EL layers 103a and 103b in FIG. 1B) are provided between a pair of electrodes and a charge-generation layer 104 is provided between the EL layers. With the use of such a tandem light-emitting element, a light-emitting device which can be driven at low voltage with low power consumption can be obtained.
The charge-generation layer 104 has a function of injecting electrons into one of the EL layers (103a or 103b) and injecting holes into the other of the EL layers (103b or 103a) when voltage is applied between the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102. Thus, when voltage is applied in FIG. 1B such that the potential of the first electrode 101 is higher than that of the second electrode 102, the charge-generation layer 104 injects electrons into the EL layer 103a and injects holes into the EL layer 103b.
Note that in terms of light extraction efficiency, the charge-generation layer 104 preferably has a property of transmitting visible light (specifically, the charge-generation layer 104 has a visible light transmittance of 40% or more). The charge-generation layer 104 functions even when it has lower conductivity than the first electrode 101 or the second electrode 102.
FIG. 1C illustrates a stacked-layer structure of the EL layer 103 in the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention. In this case, the first electrode 101 is regarded as functioning as an anode. The EL layer 103 has a structure in which a hole-injection layer 111, a hole-transport layer 112, a light-emitting layer 113, an electron-transport layer 114, and an electron-injection layer 115 are stacked in this order over the first electrode 101. Even in the case where a plurality of EL layers are provided as in the tandem structure illustrated in FIG. 1B, the layers in each EL layer are sequentially stacked from the anode side as described above. When the first electrode 101 is a cathode and the second electrode 102 is an anode, the stacking order is reversed.
The light-emitting layer 113 included in the EL layers (103, 103a, and 103b) contains an appropriate combination of a light-emitting substance and a plurality of substances, so that fluorescence or phosphorescence of a desired emission color can be obtained. The light-emitting layer 113 may have a stacked-layer structure having different emission colors. In that case, the light-emitting substance and other substances are different between the stacked light-emitting layers. Alternatively, the plurality of EL layers (103a and 103b) in FIG. 1B may exhibit their respective emission colors. Also in that case, the light-emitting substance and other substances are different between the light-emitting layers.
In the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention, for example, a micro optical resonator (microcavity) structure in which the first electrode 101 is a reflective electrode and the second electrode 102 is a transflective electrode can be employed in FIG. 1C, whereby light emission from the light-emitting layer 113 in the EL layer 103 can be resonated between the electrodes and light emission obtained through the second electrode 102 can be intensified.
Note that when the first electrode 101 of the light-emitting element is a reflective electrode having a structure in which a reflective conductive material and a light-transmitting conductive material (transparent conductive film) are stacked, optical adjustment can be performed by controlling the thickness of the transparent conductive film. Specifically, when the wavelength of light obtained from the light-emitting layer 113 is λ, the distance between the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102 is preferably adjusted to around mλ/2 (m is a natural number).
To amplify desired light (wavelength: λ) obtained from the light-emitting layer 113, the optical path length from the first electrode 101 to a region where the desired light is obtained in the light-emitting layer 113 (light-emitting region) and the optical path length from the second electrode 102 to the region where the desired light is obtained in the light-emitting layer 113 (light-emitting region) are preferably adjusted to around (2m'+1)λ/4 (m' is a natural number). Here, the light-emitting region means a region where holes and electrons are recombined in the light-emitting layer 113.
By such optical adjustment, the spectrum of specific monochromatic light obtained from the light-emitting layer 113 can be narrowed and light emission with high color purity can be obtained.
In that case, the optical path length between the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102 is, to be exact, the total thickness from a reflective region in the first electrode 101 to a reflective region in the second electrode 102. However, it is difficult to exactly determine the reflective regions in the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102; thus, it is assumed that the above effect can be sufficiently obtained wherever the reflective regions may be set in the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102. Furthermore, the optical path length between the first electrode 101 and the light-emitting layer emitting the desired light is, to be exact, the optical path length between the reflective region in the first electrode 101 and the light-emitting region in the light-emitting layer emitting the desired light. However, it is difficult to precisely determine the reflective region in the first electrode 101 and the light-emitting region in the light-emitting layer emitting the desired light; thus, it is assumed that the above effect can be sufficiently obtained wherever the reflective region and the light-emitting region may be set in the first electrode 101 and the light-emitting layer emitting the desired light.
The light-emitting element in FIG. 1C has a microcavity structure, so that light (monochromatic light) with different wavelengths can be extracted even if the same EL layer is used. Thus, separate coloring for obtaining a plurality of emission colors (e.g., R, G, and B) is not necessary. Therefore, high resolution can be easily achieved. Note that a combination with coloring layers (color filters) is also possible. Furthermore, emission intensity of light with a specific wavelength in the front direction can be increased, whereby power consumption can be reduced.
In the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention, at least one of the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102 is a light-transmitting electrode (e.g., a transparent electrode or a transflective electrode). In the case where the light-transmitting electrode is a transparent electrode, the transparent electrode has a visible light transmittance of higher than or equal to 40%. In the case where the light-transmitting electrode is a transflective electrode, the transflective electrode has a visible light reflectance of higher than or equal to 20% and lower than or equal to 80%, and preferably higher than or equal to 40% and lower than or equal to 70%. These electrodes preferably have a resistivity of 1×10−2 Ωcm or less.
Furthermore, when one of the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102 is a reflective electrode in the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention, the visible light reflectance of the reflective electrode is higher than or equal to 40% and lower than or equal to 100%, and preferably higher than or equal to 70% and lower than or equal to 100%. This electrode preferably has a resistivity of 1×10−2 Ωcm or less.
<<Specific Structure and Fabrication Method of Light-Emitting Element>>
Specific structures and specific fabrication methods of light-emitting elements of embodiments of the present invention will be described. Here, a light-emitting element having the tandem structure in FIG. 1B and a microcavity structure will be described with reference to FIG. 1D. In the light-emitting element in FIG. 1D, the first electrode 101 is formed as a reflective electrode and the second electrode 102 is formed as a transflective electrode. Thus, a single-layer structure or a stacked-layer structure can be formed using one or more kinds of desired electrode materials. Note that the second electrode 102 is formed after formation of the EL layer 103b, with the use of a material selected as described above. For fabrication of these electrodes, a sputtering method or a vacuum evaporation method can be used.
<First Electrode and Second Electrode>
As materials used for the first electrode 101 and the second electrode 102, any of the following materials can be used in an appropriate combination as long as the functions of the electrodes described above can be fulfilled. For example, a metal, an alloy, an electrically conductive compound, a mixture of these, and the like can be appropriately used. Specifically, an In-Sn oxide (also referred to as ITO), an In-Si-Sn oxide (also referred to as ITSO), an In-Zn oxide, an In-W-Zn oxide, or the like can be used. In addition, it is possible to use a metal such as aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), indium (In), tin (Sn), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), yttrium (Y), or neodymium (Nd) or an alloy containing an appropriate combination of any of these metals. It is also possible to use a Group 1 element or a Group 2 element in the periodic table, which is not described above (e.g., lithium (Li), cesium (Cs), calcium (Ca), or strontium (Sr)), a rare earth metal such as europium (Eu) or ytterbium (Yb), an alloy containing an appropriate combination of any of these elements, graphene, or the like.
In the light-emitting element in FIG. 1D, when the first electrode 101 is an anode, a hole-injection layer 111a and a hole-transport layer 112a of the EL layer 103a are sequentially stacked over the first electrode 101 by a vacuum evaporation method. After the EL layer 103a and the charge-generation layer 104 are formed, a hole-injection layer 111b and a hole-transport layer 112b of the EL layer 103b are sequentially stacked over the charge-generation layer 104 in a similar manner.
<Hole-Injection Layer and Hole-Transport Layer>
The hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) inject holes from the first electrode 101 that is an anode and the charge-generation layer (104) to the EL layers (103, 103a, and 103b) and each contain a material with a high hole-injection property.
As examples of the material with a high hole-injection property, transition metal oxides such as molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide, ruthenium oxide, tungsten oxide, and manganese oxide can be given. Alternatively, it is possible to use any of the following materials: phthalocyanine-based compounds such as phthalocyanine (abbreviation: H2Pc) and copper phthalocyanine (abbreviation: CuPc); aromatic amine compounds such as 4,4'-bis[N-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: DPAB) and N,N'-bis{4-[bis(3-methylphenyl)amino]phenyl}-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (abbreviation: DNTPD); high molecular compounds such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (abbreviation: PEDOT/PSS); and the like.
Alternatively, as the material with a high hole-injection property, a composite material containing a hole-transport material and an acceptor material (an electron-accepting material) can also be used. In that case, the acceptor material extracts electrons from the hole-transport material, so that holes are generated in the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) and the holes are injected into the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b) through the hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b). Note that each of the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) may be formed to have a single-layer structure using a composite material containing a hole-transport material and an acceptor material (electron-accepting material), or a stacked-layer structure in which a layer including a hole-transport material and a layer including an acceptor material (electron-accepting material) are stacked.
The hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b) transport the holes, which are injected from the first electrode 101 and the charge-generation layer (104) by the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b), to the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b). Note that the hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b) each contain a hole-transport material. It is particularly preferable that the HOMO level of the hole-transport material included in the hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b) be the same as or close to that of the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b).
Examples of the acceptor material used for the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) include an oxide of a metal belonging to any of Groups 4 to 8 of the periodic table. Specifically, molybdenum oxide, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, and rhenium oxide can be given. Among these, molybdenum oxide is especially preferable since it is stable in the air, has a low hygroscopic property, and is easy to handle. Alternatively, organic acceptors such as a quinodimethane derivative, a chloranil derivative, and a hexaazatriphenylene derivative can be used. Specifically, 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (abbreviation: F4-TCNQ), chloranil, 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacyano-1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene (abbreviation: HAT-CN), and the like can be used.
The hole-transport materials used for the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) and the hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b) are preferably substances with a hole mobility of greater than or equal to 10−6 cm2/Vs. Note that other substances may be used as long as the substances have a hole-transport property higher than an electron-transport property.
Preferred hole-transport materials are π-electron rich heteroaromatic compounds (e.g., carbazole derivatives and indole derivatives) and aromatic amine compounds, examples of which include compounds having an aromatic amine skeleton, such as 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: NPB or α-NPD), N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (abbreviation: TPD), 4,4'-bis[N-(spiro-9,9'-bifluoren-2-yl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: BSPB), 4-phenyl-4'-(9-phenylfluoren-9-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: BPAFLP), 4-phenyl-3'-(9-phenylfluoren-9-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: mBPAFLP), 4-phenyl-4'-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: PCBA1BP), 3-[4-(9-phenanthryl)-phenyl]-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: PCPPn), N-(4-biphenyl)-N-(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: PCBiF), N-(1,1'-biphenyl-4-yl)-N-[4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl]-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluor en-2-amine (abbreviation: PCBBiF), 4,4'-diphenyl-4″-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: PCBBi1BP), 4-(1-naphthyl)-4'-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: PCBANB), 4,4'-di(1-naphthyl)-4″-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: PCBNBB), 9,9-dimethyl-N-phenyl-N-[4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl]fluoren-2-amine (abbreviation: PCBAF), N-phenyl-N-[4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl]spiro-9,9'-bifluoren-2-amine (abbreviation: PCBASF), 4,4',4″-tris(carbazol-9-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TCTA), 4,4',4″-tris(N,N-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TDATA), and 4,4',4″-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine (abbreviation: MTDATA); compounds having a carbazole skeleton, such as 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (abbreviation: mCP), 4,4'-di(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (abbreviation: CBP), 3,6-bis(3,5-diphenylphenyl)-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: CzTP), 3,3'-bis(9-phenyl-9H-carbazole) (abbreviation: PCCP), 3-[N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-N-phenylamino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCA1), 3,6-bis[N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-N-phenylamino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCA2), 3-[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)amino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCN1), 1,3,5-tris[4-(N-carbazolyl)phenyl]benzene (abbreviation: TCPB), and 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthracenyl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA); compounds having a thiophene skeleton, such as 4,4',4″-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl)tri(dibenzothiophene) (abbreviation: DBT3P-II), 2,8-diphenyl-4-[4-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]dibenzothiophene (abbreviation: DBTFLP-III), and 4-[4-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]-6-phenyldibenzothiophene (abbreviation: DBTFLP-IV); and compounds having a furan skeleton, such as 4,4',4″-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl)tri(dibenzofuran) (abbreviation: DBF3P-II) and 4-{3-[3-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]phenyl}dibenzofuran (abbreviation: mmDBFFLBi-II).
A high molecular compound such as poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (abbreviation: PVK), poly(4-vinyltriphenylamine) (abbreviation: PVTPA), poly[N-(4-{N'-[4-(4-diphenylamino)phenyl]phenyl-N-phenylamino}phenyl)methacryla mide] (abbreviation: PTPDMA), or poly[N,N'-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (abbreviation: Poly-TPD) can also be used.
Note that the hole-transport material is not limited to the above examples and may be one of or a combination of various known materials when used for the hole-injection layers (111, 111a, and 111b) and the hole-transport layers (112, 112a, and 112b).
Next, in the light-emitting element in FIG. 1D, the light-emitting layer 113a is formed over the hole-transport layer 112a of the EL layer 103a by a vacuum evaporation method. After the EL layer 103a and the charge-generation layer 104 are formed, the light-emitting layer 113b is formed over the hole-transport layer 112b of the EL layer 103b by a vacuum evaporation method.
<Light-Emitting Layer>
The light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b) each contain a light-emitting substance. Note that as the light-emitting substance, a substance whose emission color is blue, violet, bluish violet, green, yellowish green, yellow, orange, red, or the like is appropriately used. When the plurality of light-emitting layers (113a and 113b) are formed using different light-emitting substances, different emission colors can be exhibited (for example, complementary emission colors are combined to achieve white light emission). Furthermore, a stacked-layer structure in which one light-emitting layer contains two or more kinds of light-emitting substances may be employed.
The light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b) may each contain one or more kinds of organic compounds (a host material and an assist material) in addition to a light-emitting substance (guest material). As the one or more kinds of organic compounds, one or both of the hole-transport material and the electron-transport material described in this embodiment can be used.
There is no particular limitation on light-emitting substances other than the above that can be used for the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b), and a light-emitting substance that converts singlet excitation energy into light emission in the visible light range or a light-emitting substance that converts triplet excitation energy into light emission in the visible light range can be used. Examples of the light-emitting substance are given below.
As an example of the light-emitting substance that converts singlet excitation energy into light emission, a substance that emits fluorescence (fluorescent material) can be given. Examples of the substance that emits fluorescence include a pyrene derivative, an anthracene derivative, a triphenylene derivative, a fluorene derivative, a carbazole derivative, a dibenzothiophene derivative, a dibenzofuran derivative, a dibenzoquinoxaline derivative, a quinoxaline derivative, a pyridine derivative, a pyrimidine derivative, a phenanthrene derivative, and a naphthalene derivative. A pyrene derivative is particularly preferable because it has a high emission quantum yield. Specific examples of the pyrene derivative include N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-bis[3-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]pyrene-1,6-diamine (abbreviation: 1,6mMemFLPAPrn), N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis[4-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]pyrene-1,6-diamine (abbreviation: 1,6FLPAPrn), N,N'-bis(dibenzofuran-2-yl)-N,N'-diphenylpyrene-1,6-diamine (abbreviation: 1,6FrAPrn), N,N'-bis(dibenzothiophen-2-yl)-N,N'-diphenylpyrene-1,6-diamine (abbreviation: 1,6ThAPrn), N,N'-(pyrene-1,6-diyl)bis[(N-phenylbenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan)-6-amine](abbreviation: 1,6BnfAPrn), N,N'-(pyrene-1,6-diyl)bis[(N-phenylbenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan)-8-amine](abbreviation: 1,6BnfAPrn-02), and N,N'-(pyrene-1,6-diyl)bis[(6,N-diphenylbenzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan)-8-amine](abbreviation: 1,6BnfAPrn-03).

As examples of a light-emitting substance that converts triplet excitation energy into light emission, a substance that emits phosphorescence (phosphorescent material) and a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) material that exhibits thermally activated delayed fluorescence can be given.
Examples of a phosphorescent material include an organometallic complex, a metal complex (platinum complex), and a rare earth metal complex. These substances exhibit the respective emission colors (emission peaks) and thus, any of them is appropriately selected according to need.

As the organic compounds (the host material and the assist material) used in the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b), one or more kinds of substances having a larger energy gap than the light-emitting substance (the guest material) are used. Note that any of the hole-transport materials listed above and the electron-transport materials given below may be used as the organic compounds (the host material and the assist material).
When the light-emitting substance is a fluorescent material, it is preferable to use, as the host material, an organic compound that has a high energy level in a singlet excited state and has a low energy level in a triplet excited state. For example, an anthracene derivative or a tetracene derivative is preferably used. Specific examples include 9-phenyl-3-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: PCzPA), 3-[4-(1-naphthyl)-phenyl]-9-phenyl-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: PCPN), 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthracenyl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA), 7-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-7H-dibenzo[c,g]carbazole (abbreviation: cgDBCzPA), 6-[3-(9,10-diphenyl-2-anthryl)phenyl]-benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan (abbreviation: 2mBnfPPA), 9-phenyl-10-{4-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)biphenyl-4'-yl}anthracene (abbreviation: FLPPA), 5,12-diphenyltetracene, and 5,12-bis(biphenyl-2-yl)tetracene.
In the case where the light-emitting substance is a phosphorescent material, an organic compound having triplet excitation energy (energy difference between a ground state and a triplet excited state) which is higher than that of the light-emitting substance is preferably selected as the host material. In that case, it is possible to use a zinc- or aluminum-based metal complex, an oxadiazole derivative, a triazole derivative, a benzimidazole derivative, a quinoxaline derivative, a dibenzoquinoxaline derivative, a dibenzothiophene derivative, a dibenzofuran derivative, a pyrimidine derivative, a triazine derivative, a pyridine derivative, a bipyridine derivative, a phenanthroline derivative, an aromatic amine, a carbazole derivative, and the like.

In addition, condensed polycyclic aromatic compounds such as anthracene derivatives, phenanthrene derivatives, pyrene derivatives, chrysene derivatives, and dibenzo[g,p]chrysene derivatives can be used. Specifically, 9,10-diphenylanthracene (abbreviation: DPAnth), N,N-diphenyl-9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: CzA1PA), 4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: DPhPA), YGAPA, PCAPA, N,9-diphenyl-N-{4-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]phenyl}-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: PCAPBA), N-(9,10-diphenyl-2-anthryl)-N,9-diphenyl-9H-carbazol-3-amine (abbreviation: 2PCAPA), 6,12-dimethoxy-5,11-diphenylchrysene, N,N,N',N',N″,N″,N'″,N'″-octaphenyldibenzo[g,p]chrysene-2,7,10,15-tetraamine (abbreviation: DBC1), 9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthracenyl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: CzPA), 3,6-diphenyl-9-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: DPCzPA), 9,10-bis(3,5-diphenylphenyl)anthracene (abbreviation: DPPA), 9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (abbreviation: DNA), 2-tert-butyl-9,10-di(2-naphthyl)anthracene (abbreviation: t-BuDNA), 9,9'-bianthryl (abbreviation: BANT), 9,9'-(stilbene-3,3'-diyl)diphenanthrene (abbreviation: DPNS), 9,9'-(stilbene-4,4'-diyl)diphenanthrene (abbreviation: DPNS2), 1,3,5-tri(1-pyrenyl)benzene (abbreviation: TPB3), or the like can be used.
In the case where a plurality of organic compounds are used for the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b), compounds that form an exciplex are preferably used in combination with a phosphorescent substance. With such a structure, light emission can be obtained by exciplex-triplet energy transfer (ExTET), which is energy transfer from an exciplex to a phosphorescent substance. In that case, although any of various organic compounds can be used in an appropriate combination, in order to form an exciplex efficiently, it is particularly preferable to combine a compound that easily accepts holes (hole-transport material) and a compound that easily accepts electrons (electron-transport material). As the hole-transport material and the electron-transport material, specifically, any of the materials described in this embodiment can be used.
The TADF material is a material that can up-convert a triplet excited state into a singlet excited state (i.e., reverse intersystem crossing is possible) using a little thermal energy and efficiently exhibits light emission (fluorescence) from the singlet excited state. The TADF is efficiently obtained under the condition where the difference in energy between the triplet excited level and the singlet excited level is greater than or equal to 0 eV and less than or equal to 0.2 eV, preferably greater than or equal to 0 eV and less than or equal to 0.1 eV. Note that “delayed fluorescence” exhibited by the TADF material refers to light emission having the same spectrum as normal fluorescence and an extremely long lifetime. The lifetime is 10−6 seconds or longer, preferably 10−3 seconds or longer.
Examples of the TADF material include fullerene, a derivative thereof, an acridine derivative such as proflavine, and eosin. Other examples include a metal-containing porphyrin, such as a porphyrin containing magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), tin (Sn), platinum (Pt), indium (In), or palladium (Pd). Examples of the metal-containing porphyrin include a protoporphyrin-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(Proto IX)), a mesoporphyrin-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(Meso IX)), a hematoporphyrin-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(Hemato IX)), a coproporphyrin tetramethyl ester-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(Copro III-4Me)), an octaethylporphyrin-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(OEP)), an etioporphyrin-tin fluoride complex (abbreviation: SnF2(Etio I)), and an octaethylporphyrin-platinum chloride complex (abbreviation: PtCl2OEP).
Alternatively, a heterocyclic compound having a π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring and a π-electron deficient heteroaromatic ring, such as 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-4,6-bis(12-phenylindolo[2,3-a]carbazol-11-yl)-1,3,5-triazine (abbreviation: PIC-TRZ), 2-{4-[3-(N-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-9H-carbazol-9-yl]phenyl}-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (abbreviation: PCCzPTzn), 2-[4-(10H-phenoxazin-10-yl)phenyl]-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (abbreviation: PXZ-TRZ), 3-[4-(5-phenyl-5,10-dihydrophenazin-10-yl)phenyl]-4,5-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviation: PPZ-3TPT), 3-(9,9-dimethyl-9H-acridin-10-yl)-9H-xanthen-9-one (abbreviation: ACRXTN), bis[4-(9,9-dimethyl-9,10-dihydroacridine)phenyl]sulfone (abbreviation: DMAC-DPS), or 10-phenyl-10H,10'H-spiro[acridin-9,9'-anthracen]-10'-one (abbreviation: ACRSA) can be used. Note that a substance in which the π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring is directly bonded to the π-electron deficient heteroaromatic ring is particularly preferable because both the donor property of the π-electron rich heteroaromatic ring and the acceptor property of the π-electron deficient heteroaromatic ring are increased and the energy difference between the singlet excited state and the triplet excited state becomes small.
Note that when a TADF material is used, the TADF material can be combined with another organic compound.
In the light-emitting element in FIG. 1D, the electron-transport layer 114a is formed over the light-emitting layer 113a of the EL layer 103a by a vacuum evaporation method. After the EL layer 103a and the charge-generation layer 104 are formed, the electron-transport layer 114b is formed over the light-emitting layer 113b of the EL layer 103b by a vacuum evaporation method.
<Electron-Transport Layer>
The electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b) transport the electrons, which are injected from the second electrode 102 and the charge-generation layer (104) by the electron-injection layers (115, 115a, and 115b), to the light-emitting layers (113, 113a, and 113b). Note that the electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b) each contain an electron-transport material. It is preferable that the electron-transport materials included in the electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b) be substances with an electron mobility of higher than or equal to 1×10−6 cm2/Vs. Note that other substances may also be used as long as the substances have an electron-transport property higher than a hole-transport property.
Examples of the electron-transport material include metal complexes having a quinoline ligand, a benzoquinoline ligand, an oxazole ligand, and a thiazole ligand; an oxadiazole derivative; a triazole derivative; a phenanthroline derivative; a pyridine derivative; and a bipyridine derivative. In addition, a π-electron deficient heteroaromatic compound such as a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic compound can also be used.
Specifically, it is possible to use metal complexes such as Alq3, tris(4-methyl-8-quinolinolato)aluminum (abbreviation: Almq3), bis(10-hydroxybenzo[h]quinolinato)beryllium (abbreviation: BeBq2), BAlq, bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazolato]zinc(II) (abbreviation: Zn(BOX)2), and bis[2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazolato]zinc (abbreviation: Zn(BTZ)2), heteroaromatic compounds such as 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (abbreviation: PBD), 1,3-bis[5-(p-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]benzene (abbreviation: OXD-7), 3-(4'-tert-butylphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-(4″-biphenyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviation: TAZ), 3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-(4-ethylphenyl)-5-(4-biphenylyl)-1,2,4-triazole (abbreviation: p-EtTAZ), bathophenanthroline (abbreviation: Bphen), bathocuproine (abbreviation: BCP), and 4,4'-bis(5-methylbenzoxazol-2-yl)stilbene (abbreviation: BzOs), and quinoxaline derivatives and dibenzoquinoxaline derivatives such as 2-[3-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)phenyl]dibenzo[fh]quinoxaline (abbreviation: 2mDBTPDBq-II), 2-[3'-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)biphenyl-3-yl]dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (abbreviation: 2mDBTBPDBq-II), 2-[4-(3,6-diphenyl-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl]dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (abbreviation: 2CzPDBq-III), 7-[3-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)phenyl]dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (abbreviation: 7mDBTPDBq-II), and 6-[3-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)phenyl]dibenzo[f,h]quinoxaline (abbreviation: 6mDBTPDBq-II).
Alternatively, a high molecular compound such as poly(2,5-pyridinediyl) (abbreviation: PPy), poly[(9,9-dihexylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-co-(pyridine-3,5-diyl)](abbreviation: PF-Py), or poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-co-(2,2'-bipyridine-6,6'-diyl)] (abbreviation: PF-BPy) can be used.
Each of the electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b) is not limited to a single layer, but may be a stack of two or more layers each containing any of the above substances.
Next, in the light-emitting element in FIG. 1D, the electron-injection layer 115a is formed over the electron-transport layer 114a of the EL layer 103a by a vacuum evaporation method. Subsequently, the EL layer 103a and the charge-generation layer 104 are formed, the components up to the electron-transport layer 114b of the EL layer 103b are formed, and then the electron-injection layer 115b is formed thereover by a vacuum evaporation method.
<Electron-Injection Layer>
The electron-injection layers (115, 115a, and 115b) each contain a substance having a high electron-injection property. The electron-injection layers (115, 115a, and 115b) can each be formed using an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, or a compound thereof, such as lithium fluoride (LiF), cesium fluoride (CsF), calcium fluoride (CaF2), or lithium oxide (LiOx). A rare earth metal compound like erbium fluoride (ErF3) can also be used. Electride may also be used for the electron-injection layers (115, 115a, and 115b). Examples of the electride include a substance in which electrons are added at high concentration to calcium oxide-aluminum oxide. Any of the substances for forming the electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b), which are given above, can also be used.
A composite material in which an organic compound and an electron donor (donor) are mixed may also be used for the electron-injection layers (115, 115a, and 115b). Such a composite material is excellent in an electron-injection property and an electron-transport property because electrons are generated in the organic compound by the electron donor. The organic compound here is preferably a material excellent in transporting the generated electrons; specifically, for example, the electron-transport materials for forming the electron-transport layers (114, 114a, and 114b) (e.g., a metal complex or a heteroaromatic compound) can be used. As the electron donor, a substance showing an electron-donating property with respect to the organic compound may be used. Preferable examples are an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, and a rare earth metal. Specifically, lithium, cesium, magnesium, calcium, erbium, ytterbium, and the like can be given. Furthermore, an alkali metal oxide and an alkaline earth metal oxide are preferable, and a lithium oxide, a calcium oxide, a barium oxide, and the like can be given. Alternatively, a Lewis base such as magnesium oxide can be used. Further alternatively, an organic compound such as tetrathiafulvalene (abbreviation: TTF) can be used.
In the case where light obtained from the light-emitting layer 113b is amplified in the light-emitting element illustrated in FIG. 1D, for example, the optical path length between the second electrode 102 and the light-emitting layer 113b is preferably less than one fourth of the wavelength λ of light emitted from the light-emitting layer 113b. In that case, the optical path length can be adjusted by changing the thickness of the electron-transport layer 114b or the electron-injection layer 115b.
<Charge-Generation Layer>
The charge-generation layer 104 has a function of injecting electrons into the EL layer 103a and injecting holes into the EL layer 103b when a voltage is applied between the first electrode (anode) 101 and the second electrode (cathode) 102. The charge-generation layer 104 may have either a structure in which an electron acceptor (acceptor) is added to a hole-transport material or a structure in which an electron donor (donor) is added to an electron-transport material. Alternatively, both of these structures may be stacked. Note that forming the charge-generation layer 104 by using any of the above materials can suppress an increase in drive voltage caused by the stack of the EL layers.
In the case where the charge-generation layer 104 has a structure in which an electron acceptor is added to a hole-transport material, any of the materials described in this embodiment can be used as the hole-transport material. As the electron acceptor, it is possible to use 7,7,8,8-tetracyano-2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroquinodimethane (abbreviation: F4-TCNQ), chloranil, and the like. In addition, oxides of metals that belong to Group 4 to Group 8 of the periodic table can be given. Specifically, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, rhenium oxide, or the like is used.
In the case where the charge-generation layer 104 has a structure in which an electron donor is added to an electron-transport material, any of the materials described in this embodiment can be used as the electron-transport material. As the electron donor, it is possible to use an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a rare earth metal, metals that belong to Groups 2 and 13 of the periodic table, or an oxide or carbonate thereof. Specifically, lithium (Li), cesium (Cs), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), ytterbium (Yb), indium (In), lithium oxide, cesium carbonate, or the like is preferably used. Alternatively, an organic compound such as tetrathianaphthacene may be used as the electron donor.
<Substrate>
The light-emitting element described in this embodiment can be formed over any of a variety of substrates. Note that the type of the substrate is not limited to a certain type. Examples of the substrate include a semiconductor substrate (e.g., a single crystal substrate or a silicon substrate), an SOI substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a plastic substrate, a metal substrate, a stainless steel substrate, a substrate including stainless steel foil, a tungsten substrate, a substrate including tungsten foil, a flexible substrate, an attachment film, paper including a fibrous material, and a base material film.

For fabrication of the light-emitting element in this embodiment, a vacuum process such as an evaporation method or a solution process such as a spin coating method or an ink-jet method can be used. When an evaporation method is used, a physical vapor deposition method (PVD method) such as a sputtering method, an ion plating method, an ion beam evaporation method, a molecular beam evaporation method, or a vacuum evaporation method, a chemical vapor deposition method (CVD method), or the like can be used. Specifically, the functional layers (the hole-injection layers (111a and 111b), the hole-transport layers (112a and 112b), the light-emitting layers (113a and 113b), the electron-transport layers (114a and 114b), the electron-injection layers (115a and 115b)) included in the EL layers and the charge-generation layer 104 of the light-emitting element can be formed by an evaporation method (e.g., a vacuum evaporation method), a coating method (e.g., a dip coating method, a die coating method, a bar coating method, a spin coating method, or a spray coating method), a printing method (e.g., an ink-jet method, screen printing (stencil), offset printing (planography), flexography (relief printing), gravure printing, micro-contact printing, or nanoimprinting), or the like.
Note that materials that can be used for the functional layers (the hole-injection layers (111a and 111b), the hole-transport layers (112a and 112b), the light-emitting layers (113a and 113b), the electron-transport layers (114a and 114b), and the electron-injection layers (115a and 115b)) that are included in the EL layers (103a and 103b) and the charge-generation layer 104 in the light-emitting element described in this embodiment are not limited to the above materials, and other materials can be used in combination as long as the functions of the layers are fulfilled. For example, a high molecular compound (e.g., an oligomer, a dendrimer, or a polymer), a middle molecular compound (a compound between a low molecular compound and a high molecular compound with a molecular weight of 400 to 4000), an inorganic compound (e.g., a quantum dot material), or the like can be used. The quantum dot may be a colloidal quantum dot, an alloyed quantum dot, a core-shell quantum dot, a core quantum dot, or the like.
The structures described in this embodiment can be combined with any of the structures described in the other embodiments as appropriate.
Embodiment 3
In this embodiment, a light-emitting device of one embodiment of the present invention is described. Note that a light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 2A is an active-matrix light-emitting device in which transistors (FETs) 202 are electrically connected to light-emitting elements (203R, 203G, 203B, and 203W) over a first substrate 201. The light-emitting elements (203R, 203G, 203B, and 203W) include a common EL layer 204 and each have a microcavity structure in which the optical path length between electrodes is adjusted depending on the emission color of the light-emitting element. The light-emitting device is a top-emission light-emitting device in which light is emitted from the EL layer 204 through color filters (206R, 206G, and 206B) formed on a second substrate 205.
The light-emitting device illustrated in FIG. 2A is fabricated such that a first electrode 207 functions as a reflective electrode and a second electrode 208 functions as a transflective electrode. Note that description in any of the other embodiments can be referred to as appropriate for electrode materials for the first electrode 207 and the second electrode 208.
In the case where the light-emitting element 203R functions as a red light-emitting element, the light-emitting element 203G functions as a green light-emitting element, the light-emitting element 203B functions as a blue light-emitting element, and the light-emitting element 203W functions as a white light-emitting element in FIG. 2A, for example, a gap between the first electrode 207 and the second electrode 208 in the light-emitting element 203R is adjusted to have an optical path length 200R, a gap between the first electrode 207 and the second electrode 208 in the light-emitting element 203G is adjusted to have an optical path length 200G, and a gap between the first electrode 207 and the second electrode 208 in the light-emitting element 203B is adjusted to have an optical path length 200B as illustrated in FIG. 2B. Note that optical adjustment can be performed in such a manner that a conductive layer 207R is stacked over the first electrode 207 in the light-emitting element 203R and a conductive layer 207G is stacked over the first electrode 207 in the light-emitting element 203G as illustrated in FIG. 2B.
The second substrate 205 is provided with the color filters (206R, 206G, and 206B). Note that the color filters each transmit visible light in a specific wavelength range and blocks visible light in a specific wavelength range. Thus, as illustrated in FIG. 2A, the color filter 206R that transmits only light in the red wavelength range is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting element 203R, whereby red light emission can be obtained from the light-emitting element 203R. Furthermore, the color filter 206G that transmits only light in the green wavelength range is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting element 203G, whereby green light emission can be obtained from the light-emitting element 203G. Moreover, the color filter 206B that transmits only light in the blue wavelength range is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting element 203B, whereby blue light emission can be obtained from the light-emitting element 203B. Note that the light-emitting element 203W can emit white light without a color filter. Note that a black layer (black matrix) 209 may be provided at an end portion of each color filter. The color filters (206R, 206G, and 206B) and the black layer 209 may be covered with an overcoat layer formed using a transparent material.
Although the light-emitting device in FIG. 2A has a structure in which light is extracted from the second substrate 205 side (top emission structure), a structure in which light is extracted from the first substrate 201 side where the FETs 202 are formed (bottom emission structure) may be employed as illustrated in FIG. 2C. In the case of a bottom-emission light-emitting device, the first electrode 207 is formed as a transflective electrode and the second electrode 208 is formed as a reflective electrode. As the first substrate 201, a substrate having at least a light-transmitting property is used. As illustrated in FIG. 2C, color filters (206R', 206G', and 206B') are provided so as to be closer to the first substrate 201 than the light-emitting elements (203R, 203G, and 203B) are.
In FIG. 2A, the light-emitting elements are the red light-emitting element, the green light-emitting element, the blue light-emitting element, and the white light-emitting element; however, the light-emitting elements of one embodiment of the present invention are not limited to the above, and a yellow light-emitting element or an orange light-emitting element may be used. Note that description in any of the other embodiments can be referred to as appropriate for materials that are used for the EL layers (a light-emitting layer, a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an electron-transport layer, an electron-injection layer, a charge-generation layer, and the like) to fabricate each of the light-emitting elements. In that case, a color filter needs to be appropriately selected depending on the emission color of the light-emitting element.
With the above structure, a light-emitting device including light-emitting elements that exhibit a plurality of emission colors can be fabricated.
Note that the structures described in this embodiment can be combined with any of the structures described in the other embodiments as appropriate.
Embodiment 4
In this embodiment, a light-emitting device of one embodiment of the present invention is described.
The use of the element structure of the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention allows fabrication of an active-matrix light-emitting device or a passive-matrix light-emitting device. Note that an active-matrix light-emitting device has a structure including a combination of a light-emitting element and a transistor (FET). Thus, each of a passive-matrix light-emitting device and an active-matrix light-emitting device is one embodiment of the present invention. Note that any of the light-emitting elements described in other embodiments can be used in the light-emitting device described in this embodiment.
In this embodiment, an active-matrix light-emitting device will be described with reference to FIGS. 3A and 3B.
FIG. 3A is a top view illustrating the light-emitting device, and FIG. 3B is a cross-sectional view taken along chain line A-A' in FIG. 3A. The active-matrix light-emitting device includes a pixel portion 302, a driver circuit portion (source line driver circuit) 303, and driver circuit portions (gate line driver circuits) (304a and 304b) that are provided over a first substrate 301. The pixel portion 302 and the driver circuit portions (303, 304a, and 304b) are sealed between the first substrate 301 and a second substrate 306 with a sealant 305.
A lead wiring 307 is provided over the first substrate 301. The lead wiring 307 is connected to an FPC 308 that is an external input terminal. Note that the FPC 308 transmits a signal (e.g., a video signal, a clock signal, a start signal, or a reset signal) or a potential from the outside to the driver circuit portions (303, 304a, and 304b). The FPC 308 may be provided with a printed wiring board (PWB). Note that the light-emitting device provided with an FPC or a PWB is included in the category of a light-emitting device.
FIG. 3B illustrates a cross-sectional structure of the light-emitting device.
The pixel portion 302 includes a plurality of pixels each of which includes an FET (switching FET) 311, an FET (current control FET) 312, and a first electrode 313 electrically connected to the FET 312. Note that the number of FETs included in each pixel is not particularly limited and can be set appropriately.
As FETs 309, 310, 311, and 312, for example, a staggered transistor or an inverted staggered transistor can be used without particular limitation. A top-gate transistor, a bottom-gate transistor, or the like may be used.
Note that there is no particular limitation on the crystallinity of a semiconductor that can be used for the FETs 309, 310, 311, and 312, and an amorphous semiconductor or a semiconductor having crystallinity (a microcrystalline semiconductor, a polycrystalline semiconductor, a single crystal semiconductor, or a semiconductor partly including crystal regions) may be used. A semiconductor having crystallinity is preferably used, in which case deterioration of the transistor characteristics can be suppressed.
For the semiconductor, a Group 14 element, a compound semiconductor, an oxide semiconductor, an organic semiconductor, or the like can be used, for example. As a typical example, a semiconductor containing silicon, a semiconductor containing gallium arsenide, or an oxide semiconductor containing indium can be used.
The driver circuit portion 303 includes the FET 309 and the FET 310. The FET 309 and the FET 310 may be formed with a circuit including transistors having the same conductivity type (either n-channel transistors or p-channel transistors) or a CMOS circuit including an n-channel transistor and a p-channel transistor. Furthermore, a driver circuit may be provided outside.
An end portion of the first electrode 313 is covered with an insulator 314. The insulator 314 can be formed using an organic compound such as a negative photosensitive resin or a positive photosensitive resin (acrylic resin), or an inorganic compound such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, or silicon nitride. The insulator 314 preferably has a curved surface with curvature at an upper end portion or a lower end portion thereof. In that case, favorable coverage with a film formed over the insulator 314 can be obtained.
An EL layer 315 and a second electrode 316 are stacked over the first electrode 313. The EL layer 315 includes a light-emitting layer, a hole-injection layer, a hole-transport layer, an electron-transport layer, an electron-injection layer, a charge-generation layer, and the like.
The structure and materials described in any of the other embodiments can be used for the components of a light-emitting element 317 described in this embodiment. Although not illustrated, the second electrode 316 is electrically connected to the FPC 308 that is an external input terminal.
Although the cross-sectional view in FIG. 3B illustrates only one light-emitting element 317, a plurality of light-emitting elements are arranged in a matrix in the pixel portion 302. Light-emitting elements that emit light of three kinds of colors (R, G, and B) are selectively formed in the pixel portion 302, whereby a light-emitting device capable of displaying a full-color image can be obtained. In addition to the light-emitting elements that emit light of three kinds of colors (R, G, and B), for example, light-emitting elements that emit light of white (W), yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and the like may be formed. For example, the light-emitting elements that emit light of some of the above colors are used in combination with the light-emitting elements that emit light of three kinds of colors (R, G, and B), whereby effects such as an improvement in color purity and a reduction in power consumption can be achieved. Alternatively, a light-emitting device which is capable of displaying a full-color image may be fabricated by a combination with color filters. As color filters, red (R), green (G), blue (B), cyan (C), magenta (M), and yellow (Y) color filters and the like can be used.
When the second substrate 306 and the first substrate 301 are bonded to each other with the sealant 305, the FETs (309, 310, 311, and 312) and the light-emitting element 317 over the first substrate 301 are provided in a space 318 surrounded by the first substrate 301, the second substrate 306, and the sealant 305. Note that the space 318 may be filled with an inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon) or an organic substance (including the sealant 305).
An epoxy-based resin, glass frit, or the like can be used for the sealant 305. It is preferable to use a material that is permeable to as little moisture and oxygen as possible for the sealant 305. As the second substrate 306, a substrate that can be used as the first substrate 301 can be similarly used. Thus, any of the various substrates described in the other embodiments can be appropriately used. As the substrate, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, or a plastic substrate made of fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP), polyvinyl fluoride (PVF), polyester, acrylic, or the like can be used. In the case where glass frit is used for the sealant, the first substrate 301 and the second substrate 306 are preferably glass substrates in terms of adhesion.
Accordingly, the active-matrix light-emitting device can be obtained.
In the case where the active-matrix light-emitting device is provided over a flexible substrate, the FETs and the light-emitting element may be directly formed over the flexible substrate; alternatively, the FETs and the light-emitting element may be formed over a substrate provided with a separation layer and then separated at the separation layer by application of heat, force, laser, or the like to be transferred to a flexible substrate. For the separation layer, a stack including inorganic films such as a tungsten film and a silicon oxide film, or an organic resin film of polyimide or the like can be used, for example. Examples of the flexible substrate include, in addition to a substrate over which a transistor can be formed, a paper substrate, a cellophane substrate, an aramid film substrate, a polyimide film substrate, a cloth substrate (including a natural fiber (e.g., silk, cotton, or hemp), a synthetic fiber (e.g., nylon, polyurethane, or polyester), a regenerated fiber (e.g., acetate, cupra, rayon, or regenerated polyester), or the like), a leather substrate, and a rubber substrate. With the use of any of these substrates, an increase in durability, an increase in heat resistance, a reduction in weight, and a reduction in thickness can be achieved.
Note that the structures described in this embodiment can be combined with any of the structures described in the other embodiments as appropriate.

In this embodiment, touch panels including the light-emitting device of one embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 9A and 9B, FIGS. 10A and 10B, FIGS. 11A and 11B, FIGS. 12A and 12B, and FIG. 13.
FIGS. 9A and 9B are perspective views of a touch panel 2000. Note that FIGS. 9A and 9B illustrate only main components of the touch panel 2000 for simplicity.
The touch panel 2000 includes a display panel 2501 and a touch sensor 2595 (see FIG. 9B). The touch panel 2000 includes a substrate 2510, a substrate 2570, and a substrate 2590.
The display panel 2501 includes, over the substrate 2510, a plurality of pixels and a plurality of wirings 2511 through which signals are supplied to the pixels. The plurality of wirings 2511 are led to a peripheral portion of the substrate 2510, and parts of the plurality of wirings 2511 form a terminal 2519. The terminal 2519 is electrically connected to an FPC 2509(1).
The substrate 2590 includes the touch sensor 2595 and a plurality of wirings 2598 electrically connected to the touch sensor 2595. The plurality of wirings 2598 are led to a peripheral portion of the substrate 2590, and parts of the plurality of wirings 2598 form a terminal 2599. The terminal 2599 is electrically connected to an FPC 2509(2). Note that in FIG. 9B, electrodes, wirings, and the like of the touch sensor 2595 provided on the back side of the substrate 2590 (the side facing the substrate 2510) are indicated by solid lines for clarity.
As the touch sensor 2595, a capacitive touch sensor can be used, for example. Examples of the capacitive touch sensor include a surface capacitive touch sensor, a projected capacitive touch sensor, and the like.
Examples of the projected capacitive touch sensor are a self-capacitive touch sensor, a mutual capacitive touch sensor, and the like, which differ mainly in the driving method. The use of a mutual capacitive type is preferable because multiple points can be sensed simultaneously.
First, an example of using a projected capacitive touch sensor will be described below with reference to FIG. 9B. Note that in the case of a projected capacitive touch sensor, a variety of sensors that can sense proximity or touch of a sensing target such as a finger can be used.
The projected capacitive touch sensor 2595 includes electrodes 2591 and electrodes 2592. The electrodes 2591 are electrically connected to any of the plurality of wirings 2598, and the electrodes 2592 are electrically connected to any of the other wirings 2598. The electrodes 2592 each have a shape of a plurality of quadrangles arranged in one direction with one corner of a quadrangle connected to one corner of another quadrangle with a wiring 2594, as illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B. In the same manner, the electrodes 2591 each have a shape of a plurality of quadrangles arranged with one corner of a quadrangle connected to one corner of another quadrangle; however, the direction in which the electrodes 2591 are connected is a direction crossing the direction in which the electrodes 2592 are connected. Note that the direction in which the electrodes 2591 are connected and the direction in which the electrodes 2592 are connected are not necessarily perpendicular to each other, and the electrodes 2591 may be arranged to intersect with the electrodes 2592 at an angle greater than 0° and less than 90°.
The intersecting area of the electrode 2592 and the wiring 2594 is preferably as small as possible. Such a structure allows a reduction in the area of a region where the electrodes are not provided, reducing variation in transmittance. As a result, variation in luminance of light passing through the touch sensor 2595 can be reduced.
Note that the shapes of the electrodes 2591 and the electrodes 2592 are not limited thereto and can be any of a variety of shapes. For example, the plurality of electrodes 2591 may be provided so that a space between the electrodes 2591 is reduced as much as possible, and the plurality of electrodes 2592 may be provided with an insulating layer located between the electrodes 2591 and 2592. In this case, it is preferable to provide, between two adjacent electrodes 2592, a dummy electrode electrically insulated from these electrodes because the area of regions having different transmittances can be reduced.
Next, the touch panel 2000 will be described in detail with reference to FIGS. 10A and 10B. FIGS. 10A and 10B correspond to cross-sectional views taken along dashed-dotted line X1-X2 in FIG. 9A.
The touch panel 2000 includes the touch sensor 2595 and the display panel 2501.
The touch sensor 2595 includes the electrodes 2591 and the electrodes 2592 provided in a staggered arrangement in contact with the substrate 2590, an insulating layer 2593 covering the electrodes 2591 and the electrodes 2592, and the wiring 2594 that electrically connects the adjacent electrodes 2591 to each other. Between the adjacent electrodes 2591, the electrode 2592 is provided.
The electrodes 2591 and the electrodes 2592 can be formed using a light-transmitting conductive material. As the light-transmitting conductive material, an In-Sn oxide (also referred to as ITO), an In-Si-Sn oxide (also referred to as ITSO), an In-Zn oxide, an In-W-Zn oxide, or the like can be used. In addition, it is possible to use a metal such as aluminum (Al), titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), gallium (Ga), zinc (Zn), indium (In), tin (Sn), molybdenum (Mo), tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), palladium (Pd), gold (Au), platinum (Pt), silver (Ag), yttrium (Y), or neodymium (Nd) or an alloy containing an appropriate combination of any of these metals. A graphene compound may be used as well. When a graphene compound is used, it can be formed, for example, by reducing a graphene oxide film. As a reducing method, a method with application of heat, a method with laser irradiation, or the like can be employed.
For example, the electrodes 2591 and 2592 can be formed by depositing a light-transmitting conductive material on the substrate 2590 by a sputtering method and then removing an unneeded portion by any of various patterning techniques such as photolithography.
Examples of a material for the insulating layer 2593 include a resin such as an acrylic resin or an epoxy resin, a resin having a siloxane bond, and an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride, or aluminum oxide.
The adjacent electrodes 2591 are electrically connected to each other with the wiring 2594 formed in part of the insulating layer 2593. Note that a material for the wiring 2594 preferably has higher conductivity than materials for the electrodes 2591 and 2592 to reduce electrical resistance.
The wiring 2598 is electrically connected to any of the electrodes 2591 and 2592. Part of the wiring 2598 functions as a terminal. For the wiring 2598, a metal material such as aluminum, gold, platinum, silver, nickel, titanium, tungsten, chromium, molybdenum, iron, cobalt, copper, or palladium or an alloy material containing any of these metal materials can be used.
Through the terminal 2599, the wiring 2598 and the FPC 2509(2) are electrically connected to each other. The terminal 2599 can be formed using any of various kinds of anisotropic conductive films (ACF), anisotropic conductive pastes (ACP), and the like.
An adhesive layer 2597 is provided in contact with the wiring 2594. That is, the touch sensor 2595 is attached to the display panel 2501 so that they overlap with each other with the adhesive layer 2597 provided therebetween. Note that the substrate 2570 as illustrated in FIG. 10A may be provided over the surface of the display panel 2501 that is in contact with the adhesive layer 2597; however, the substrate 2570 is not always needed.
The adhesive layer 2597 has a light-transmitting property. For example, a thermosetting resin or an ultraviolet curable resin can be used; specifically, a resin such as an acrylic-based resin, a urethane-based resin, an epoxy-based resin, or a siloxane-based resin can be used.
The display panel 2501 in FIG. 10A includes, between the substrate 2510 and the substrate 2570, a plurality of pixels arranged in a matrix and a driver circuit. Each pixel includes a light-emitting element and a pixel circuit that drives the light-emitting element.
In FIG. 10A, a pixel 2502R is shown as an example of the pixel of the display panel 2501, and a scan line driver circuit 2503g is shown as an example of the driver circuit.
The pixel 2502R includes a light-emitting element 2550R and a transistor 2502t that can supply electric power to the light-emitting element 2550R.
The transistor 2502t is covered with an insulating layer 2521. The insulating layer 2521 has a function of providing a flat surface by covering unevenness caused by the transistor and the like that have been already formed. The insulating layer 2521 may serve also as a layer for preventing diffusion of impurities. That is preferable because a reduction in the reliability of the transistor or the like due to diffusion of impurities can be prevented.
The light-emitting element 2550R is electrically connected to the transistor 2502t through a wiring. It is one electrode of the light-emitting element 2550R that is directly connected to the wiring. An end portion of the one electrode of the light-emitting element 2550R is covered with an insulator 2528.
The light-emitting element 2550R includes an EL layer between a pair of electrodes. A coloring layer 2567R is provided to overlap with the light-emitting element 2550R, and part of light emitted from the light-emitting element 2550R is transmitted through the coloring layer 2567R and extracted in the direction indicated by an arrow in the drawing. A light-blocking layer 2567BM is provided at an end portion of the coloring layer, and a sealing layer 2560 is provided between the light-emitting element 2550R and the coloring layer 2567R.
Note that when the sealing layer 2560 is provided on the side from which light from the light-emitting element 2550R is extracted, the sealing layer 2560 preferably has a light-transmitting property. The sealing layer 2560 preferably has a higher refractive index than the air.
The scan line driver circuit 2503g includes a transistor 2503t and a capacitor 2503c. Note that the driver circuit and the pixel circuits can be formed in the same process over the same substrate. Thus, in a manner similar to that of the transistor 2502t in the pixel circuit, the transistor 2503t in the driver circuit (the scan line driver circuit 2503g) is also covered with the insulating layer 2521.
The wirings 2511 through which a signal can be supplied to the transistor 2503t are provided. The terminal 2519 is provided in contact with the wiring 2511. The terminal 2519 is electrically connected to the FPC 2509(1), and the FPC 2509(1) has a function of supplying signals such as an image signal and a synchronization signal. Note that a printed wiring board (PWB) may be attached to the FPC 2509(1).
Although the case where the display panel 2501 illustrated in FIG. 10A includes a bottom-gate transistor is described, the structure of the transistor is not limited thereto, and any of transistors with various structures can be used. In each of the transistors 2502t and 2503t illustrated in FIG. 10A, a semiconductor layer containing an oxide semiconductor can be used for a channel region. Alternatively, a semiconductor layer containing amorphous silicon or a semiconductor layer containing polycrystalline silicon that is obtained by crystallization process such as laser annealing can be used for a channel region.
FIG. 10B illustrates the structure that includes a top-gate transistor instead of the bottom-gate transistor illustrated in FIG. 10A. The kind of the semiconductor layer that can be used for the channel region does not depend on the structure of the transistor.
In the touch panel 2000 illustrated in FIG. 10A, an anti-reflection layer 2567p overlapping with at least the pixel is preferably provided on a surface of the touch panel on the side from which light from the pixel is extracted, as illustrated in FIG. 10A. As the anti-reflection layer 2567p, a circular polarizing plate or the like can be used.
For the substrates 2510, 2570, and 2590 in FIG. 10A, for example, a flexible material having a vapor permeability of 1×10−5 g/(m2·day) or lower, preferably 1×10−6 g/(m2·day) or lower, can be favorably used. Alternatively, it is preferable to use the materials that make these substrates have substantially the same coefficient of thermal expansion. For example, the coefficients of linear expansion of the materials are 1×10−3/K or lower, preferably 5×10−5/K or lower, and further preferably 1×10−5/K or lower.
Next, a touch panel 2000' having a structure different from that of the touch panel 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 10A and 10B will be described with reference to FIGS. 11A and 11B. It can be used as a touch panel like the touch panel 2000.
FIGS. 11A and 11B are cross-sectional views of the touch panel 2000'. In the touch panel 2000' illustrated in FIGS. 11A and 11B, the position of the touch sensor 2595 relative to the display panel 2501 is different from that in the touch panel 2000 illustrated in FIGS. 10A and 10B. Only different structures will be described below, and the above description of the touch panel 2000 can be referred to for the other similar structures.
The coloring layer 2567R overlaps with the light-emitting element 2550R. The light-emitting element 2550R illustrated in FIG. 11A emits light to the side where the transistor 2502t is provided. That is, (part of) light emitted from the light-emitting element 2550R passes through the coloring layer 2567R and is extracted in the direction indicated by an arrow in FIG. 11A. Note that the light-blocking layer 2567BM is provided at an end portion of the coloring layer 2567R.
The touch sensor 2595 is provided on the transistor 2502t side (the far side from the light-emitting element 2550R) of the display panel 2501 (see FIG. 11A).
The adhesive layer 2597 is in contact with the substrate 2510 of the display panel 2501 and attaches the display panel 2501 and the touch sensor 2595 to each other in the structure illustrated in FIG. 11A. The substrate 2510 is not necessarily provided between the display panel 2501 and the touch sensor 2595 that are attached to each other by the adhesive layer 2597.
As in the touch panel 2000, transistors with any of a variety of structures can be used for the display panel 2501 in the touch panel 2000'. Although a bottom-gate transistor is used in FIG. 11A, a top-gate transistor may be used as illustrated in FIG. 11B.
An example of a driving method of the touch panel will be described with reference to FIGS. 12A and 12B.
FIG. 12A is a block diagram illustrating the structure of a mutual capacitive touch sensor. FIG. 12A illustrates a pulse voltage output circuit 2601 and a current sensing circuit 2602. Note that in FIG. 12A, six wirings X1 to X6 represent electrodes 2621 to which a pulse voltage is applied, and six wirings Y1 to Y6 represent electrodes 2622 that detect changes in current. FIG. 12A also illustrates capacitors 2603 that are each formed in a region where the electrodes 2621 and 2622 overlap with each other. Note that functional replacement between the electrodes 2621 and 2622 is possible.
The pulse voltage output circuit 2601 is a circuit for sequentially applying a pulse voltage to the wirings X1 to X6. By application of a pulse voltage to the wirings X1 to X6, an electric field is generated between the electrodes 2621 and 2622 of the capacitor 2603. When the electric field between the electrodes is shielded, for example, a change occurs in the capacitor 2603 (mutual capacitance). The approach or contact of a sensing target can be sensed by utilizing this change.
The current sensing circuit 2602 is a circuit for detecting changes in current flowing through the wirings Y1 to Y6 that are caused by the change in mutual capacitance in the capacitor 2603. No change in current value is detected in the wirings Y1 to Y6 when there is no approach or contact of a sensing target, whereas a decrease in current value is detected when mutual capacitance is decreased owing to the approach or contact of a sensing target. Note that an integrator circuit or the like is used for sensing of current values.
FIG. 12B is a timing chart showing input and output waveforms in the mutual capacitive touch sensor illustrated in FIG. 12A. In FIG. 12B, sensing of a sensing target is performed in all the rows and columns in one frame period. FIG. 12B shows a period when a sensing target is not sensed (not touched) and a period when a sensing target is sensed (touched). Sensed current values of the wirings Y1 to Y6 are shown as the waveforms of voltage values.
A pulse voltage is sequentially applied to the wirings X1 to X6, and the waveforms of the wirings Y1 to Y6 change in response to the pulse voltage. When there is no approach or contact of a sensing target, the waveforms of the wirings Y1 to Y6 change uniformly in response to changes in the voltages of the wirings X1 to X6. The current value is decreased at the point of approach or contact of a sensing target and accordingly the waveform of the voltage value changes. By detecting a change in mutual capacitance in this manner, the approach or contact of a sensing target can be sensed.
Although FIG. 12A illustrates a passive-type touch sensor in which only the capacitor 2603 is provided at the intersection of wirings as a touch sensor, an active-type touch sensor including a transistor and a capacitor may be used. FIG. 13 illustrates an example of a sensor circuit included in an active-type touch sensor.
The sensor circuit in FIG. 13 includes the capacitor 2603 and transistors 2611, 2612, and 2613.
A signal G2 is input to a gate of the transistor 2613. A voltage VRES is applied to one of a source and a drain of the transistor 2613, and one electrode of the capacitor 2603 and a gate of the transistor 2611 are electrically connected to the other of the source and the drain of the transistor 2613. One of a source and a drain of the transistor 2611 is electrically connected to one of a source and a drain of the transistor 2612, and a voltage VSS is applied to the other of the source and the drain of the transistor 2611. A signal G1 is input to a gate of the transistor 2612, and a wiring ML is electrically connected to the other of the source and the drain of the transistor 2612. The voltage VSS is applied to the other electrode of the capacitor 2603.
Next, the operation of the sensor circuit in FIG. 13 will be described. First, a potential for turning on the transistor 2613 is supplied as the signal G2, and a potential with respect to the voltage VRES is thus applied to a node n connected to the gate of the transistor 2611. Then, a potential for turning off the transistor 2613 is applied as the signal G2, whereby the potential of the node n is maintained. Then, mutual capacitance of the capacitor 2603 changes owing to the approach or contact of a sensing target such as a finger, and accordingly the potential of the node n is changed from VRES.
In reading operation, a potential for turning on the transistor 2612 is supplied as the signal G1. A current flowing through the transistor 2611, that is, a current flowing through the wiring ML is changed depending on the potential of the node n. By sensing this current, the approach or contact of a sensing target can be sensed.
In each of the transistors 2611, 2612, and 2613, an oxide semiconductor layer is preferably used as a semiconductor layer in which a channel region is formed. In particular, it is preferable to use such a transistor as the transistor 2613 because the potential of the node n can be held for a long time and the frequency of operation of resupplying VRES to the node n (refresh operation) can be reduced.
Note that the structures described in this embodiment can be combined with any of the structures described in the other embodiments as appropriate.
Embodiment 9
In this embodiment, a display device that includes the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention and a reflective liquid crystal element and that can display an image both in a transmissive mode and in a reflective mode will be described with reference to FIGS. 14A, 14B1, and 14B2, FIG. 15, and FIG. 16.
The display device described in this embodiment can be driven with extremely low power consumption for displaying an image using the reflective mode in a bright place such as outdoors. Meanwhile, in a dark place such as indoors or in a night environment, an image with a wide color gamut and high color reproducibility can be displayed with the use of the transmissive mode. Thus, by combination of these modes, the display device can display an image with low power consumption and high color reproducibility as compared with the case of a conventional display panel.
As an example of the display device of this embodiment, description will be made of a display device in which a liquid crystal element provided with a reflective electrode and a light-emitting element are stacked and an opening in the reflective electrode is provided in a position overlapping with the light-emitting element. Visible light is reflected by the reflective electrode in the reflective mode and light emitted from the light-emitting element is emitted through the opening in the reflective electrode in the transmissive mode. Note that transistors used for driving these elements (the liquid crystal element and the light-emitting element) are preferably formed on the same plane. It is preferable that the liquid crystal element and the light-emitting element be stacked with an insulating layer therebetween.
FIG. 14A is a block diagram illustrating a display device described in this embodiment. A display device 3000 includes a circuit (G) 3001, a circuit (S) 3002, and a display portion 3003. In the display portion 3003, a plurality of pixels 3004 are arranged in an R direction and a C direction in a matrix. A plurality of wirings G1, a plurality of wirings G2, a plurality of wirings ANO, and a plurality of wirings CSCOM are electrically connected to the circuit (G) 3001. These wirings are also electrically connected to the plurality of pixels 3004 arranged in the R direction. A plurality of wirings S1 and a plurality of wirings S2 are electrically connected to the circuit (S) 3002, and these wirings are also electrically connected to the plurality of pixels 3004 arranged in the C direction.
Each of the plurality of pixels 3004 includes a liquid crystal element and a light-emitting element. The liquid crystal element and the light-emitting element include portions overlapping with each other.
FIG. 14B1 shows the shape of a conductive film 3005 serving as a reflective electrode of the liquid crystal element included in the pixel 3004. Note that an opening 3007 is provided in a position 3006 which is part of the conductive film 3005 and which overlaps with the light-emitting element. That is, light emitted from the light-emitting element is emitted through the opening 3007.
The pixels 3004 in FIG. 14B1 are arranged such that the adjacent pixels 3004 in the R direction exhibit different colors. Furthermore, the openings 3007 are provided so as not to be arranged in a line in the R direction. Such arrangement has an effect of suppressing crosstalk between the light-emitting elements of adjacent pixels 3004. Furthermore, there is an advantage that element formation is facilitated owing to a reduction in the degree of miniaturization.
The opening 3007 can have a polygonal shape, a quadrangular shape, an elliptical shape, a circular shape, a cross shape, a stripe shape, or a slit-like shape, for example.
FIG. 14B2 illustrates another example of the arrangement of the conductive films 3005.
The ratio of the opening 3007 to the total area of the conductive film 3005 (excluding the opening 3007) affects the display of the display device. That is, a problem is caused in that as the area of the opening 3007 is larger, the display using the liquid crystal element becomes darker; in contrast, as the area of the opening 3007 is smaller, the display using the light-emitting element becomes darker. Furthermore, in addition to the problem of the ratio of the opening, a small area of the opening 3007 itself also causes a problem in that extraction efficiency of light emitted from the light-emitting element is decreased. The ratio of the opening 3007 to the total area of the conductive film 3005 (excluding the opening 3007) is preferably 5% or more and 60% or less because the display quality can be maintained even when the liquid crystal element and the light-emitting element are used in a combination.
Next, an example of a circuit configuration of the pixel 3004 is described with reference to FIG. 15. FIG. 15 illustrates two adjacent pixels 3004.
The pixel 3004 includes a transistor SW1, a capacitor C1, a liquid crystal element 3010, a transistor SW2, a transistor M, a capacitor C2, a light-emitting element 3011, and the like. Note that these components are electrically connected to any of the wiring G1, the wiring G2, the wiring ANO, the wiring CSCOM, the wiring S1, and the wiring S2 in the pixel 3004. The liquid crystal element 3010 and the light-emitting element 3011 are electrically connected to a wiring VCOM1 and a wiring VCOM2, respectively.
A gate of the transistor SW1 is connected to the wiring G1. One of a source and a drain of the transistor SW1 is connected to the wiring Si, and the other of the source and the drain is connected to one electrode of the capacitor C1 and one electrode of the liquid crystal element 3010. The other electrode of the capacitor C1 is connected to the wiring CSCOM. The other electrode of the liquid crystal element 3010 is connected to the wiring VCOM1.
A gate of the transistor SW2 is connected to the wiring G2. One of a source and a drain of the transistor SW2 is connected to the wiring S2, and the other of the source and the drain is connected to one electrode of the capacitor C2 and a gate of the transistor M. The other electrode of the capacitor C2 is connected to one of a source and a drain of the transistor M and the wiring ANO. The other of the source and the drain of the transistor M is connected to one electrode of the light-emitting element 3011. Furthermore, the other electrode of the light-emitting element 3011 is connected to the wiring VCOM2.
Note that the transistor M includes two gates between which a semiconductor is provided and which are electrically connected to each other. With such a structure, the amount of current flowing through the transistor M can be increased.
The on/off state of the transistor SW1 is controlled by a signal from the wiring G1. A predetermined potential is applied from the wiring VCOM1. Furthermore, orientation of liquid crystals of the liquid crystal element 3010 can be controlled by a signal from the wiring S1. A predetermined potential is applied from the wiring CSCOM.
The on/off state of the transistor SW2 is controlled by a signal from the wiring G2. By the difference between the potentials applied from the wiring VCOM2 and the wiring ANO, the light-emitting element 3011 can emit light. Furthermore, the conduction state of the transistor M can be controlled by a signal from the wiring S2.
Accordingly, in the structure of this embodiment, in the case of the reflective mode, the liquid crystal element 3010 is controlled by the signals supplied from the wiring G1 and the wiring Si and optical modulation is utilized, whereby an image can be displayed. In the case of the transmissive mode, the light-emitting element 3011 can emit light when the signals are supplied from the wiring G2 and the wiring S2. In the case where both modes are performed at the same time, desired driving can be performed on the basis of the signals from the wiring G1, the wiring G2, the wiring S1, and the wiring S2.
Next, specific description will be given with reference to FIG. 16, a schematic cross-sectional view of the display device 3000 described in this embodiment.
The display device 3000 includes a light-emitting element 3023 and a liquid crystal element 3024 between substrates 3021 and 3022. Note that the light-emitting element 3023 and the liquid crystal element 3024 are formed with an insulating layer 3025 positioned therebetween. That is, the light-emitting element 3023 is positioned between the substrate 3021 and the insulating layer 3025, and the liquid crystal element 3024 is positioned between the substrate 3022 and the insulating layer 3025.
A transistor 3015, a transistor 3016, a transistor 3017, a coloring layer 3028, and the like are provided between the insulating layer 3025 and the light-emitting element 3023.
A bonding layer 3029 is provided between the substrate 3021 and the light-emitting element 3023. The light-emitting element 3023 includes a conductive layer 3030 serving as one electrode, an EL layer 3031, and a conductive layer 3032 serving as the other electrode which are stacked in this order over the insulating layer 3025. In the light-emitting element 3023 that is a bottom emission light-emitting element, the conductive layer 3032 and the conductive layer 3030 contain a material that reflects visible light and a material that transmits visible light, respectively. Light emitted from the light-emitting element 3023 is transmitted through the coloring layer 3028 and the insulating layer 3025 and then transmitted through the liquid crystal element 3024 via an opening 3033, thereby being emitted to the outside of the substrate 3022.
In addition to the liquid crystal element 3024, a coloring layer 3034, a light-blocking layer 3035, an insulating layer 3046, a structure 3036, and the like are provided between the insulating layer 3025 and the substrate 3022. The liquid crystal element 3024 includes a conductive layer 3037 serving as one electrode, a liquid crystal 3038, a conductive layer 3039 serving as the other electrode, alignment films 3040 and 3041, and the like. Note that the liquid crystal element 3024 is a reflective liquid crystal element and the conductive layer 3039 serves as a reflective electrode; thus, the conductive layer 3039 is formed using a material with high reflectivity. Furthermore, the conductive layer 3037 serves as a transparent electrode, and thus is formed using a material that transmits visible light. The alignment films 3040 and 3041 are provided on the conductive layers 3037 and 3039 and in contact with the liquid crystal 3038. The insulating layer 3046 is provided so as to cover the coloring layer 3034 and the light-blocking layer 3035 and serves as an overcoat. Note that the alignment films 3040 and 3041 are not necessarily provided.
The opening 3033 is provided in part of the conductive layer 3039. A conductive layer 3043 is provided in contact with the conductive layer 3039. Since the conductive layer 3043 has a light-transmitting property, a material transmitting visible light is used for the conductive layer 3043.
The structure 3036 serves as a spacer that prevents the substrate 3022 from coming closer to the insulating layer 3025 than required. The structure 3036 is not necessarily provided.
One of a source and a drain of the transistor 3015 is electrically connected to the conductive layer 3030 in the light-emitting element 3023. For example, the transistor 3015 corresponds to the transistor M in FIG. 15.
One of a source and a drain of the transistor 3016 is electrically connected to the conductive layer 3039 and the conductive layer 3043 in the liquid crystal element 3024 through a terminal portion 3018. That is, the terminal portion 3018 has a function of electrically connecting the conductive layers provided on both surfaces of the insulating layer 3025. The transistor 3016 corresponds to the transistor SW1 in FIG. 15.
A terminal portion 3019 is provided in a region where the substrates 3021 and 3022 do not overlap with each other. The terminal portion 3019 electrically connects the conductive layers provided on both surfaces of the insulating layer 3025 like the terminal portion 3018. The terminal portion 3019 is electrically connected to a conductive layer obtained by processing the same conductive film as the conductive layer 3043. Thus, the terminal portion 3019 and an FPC 3044 can be electrically connected to each other through a connection layer 3045.
A connection portion 3047 is provided in part of a region where a bonding layer 3042 is provided. In the connection portion 3047, the conductive layer obtained by processing the same conductive film as the conductive layer 3043 and part of the conductive layer 3037 are electrically connected with a connector 3048. Accordingly, a signal or a potential input from the FPC 3044 can be supplied to the conductive layer 3037 through the connector 3048.
The structure 3036 is provided between the conductive layer 3037 and the conductive layer 3043. The structure 3036 has a function of maintaining a cell gap of the liquid crystal element 3024.
As the conductive layer 3043, a metal oxide, a metal nitride, or an oxide such as an oxide semiconductor whose resistance is reduced is preferably used. In the case of using an oxide semiconductor, a material in which at least one of the concentrations of hydrogen, boron, phosphorus, nitrogen, and other impurities and the number of oxygen vacancies is made to be higher than those in a semiconductor layer of a transistor is used for the conductive layer 3043.

<Step 7: Synthesis of 2-{3-[3-(benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan-8-yl)phenyl]phenyl}-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine>
Into a 200 mL three-neck flask were added 2.1 g (5.0 mmol) of 2-[3-(3-chlorophenyl)phenyl]-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine, 1.7 g (5.0 mmol) of 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(benzo[b]naphtho[1,2-d]furan-8-yl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane, 3.2 g (15 mmol) of tripotassium phosphate, and 36 mg (0.10 mmol) of di(1-adamantyl)-n-butylphosphine, and the atmosphere in the flask was replaced with nitrogen.

<img> id-US20180108847A1-20180419-C00037.TIF </img>
By a train sublimation method, 1.7 g of the obtained white powder was purified under a pressure of 0.018 Pa at 280° C. After the sublimation purification, 0.76 g of a white solid of mBnfBPTzn was obtained at a collection rate of 44%.
Analysis results by nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy of the white solid obtained by Step 7 are shown below. FIG. 17 shows the 1H-NMR chart. These results reveal that the organic compound of one embodiment of the present invention, mBnfBPTzn represented by Structural Formula (100), was obtained in this example.
1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz): δ=7.56-7.64 (m, 8H), 7.79-7.85 (m, 6H), 7.90 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 1H), 7.96 (d, J=8.5 Hz, 1H), 8.01-8.05 (m, 2H), 8.31 (s, 1H), 8.45 (d, J=8.5 Hz, 1H), 8.70 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 8.80-8.83 (m, 5H), 9.11 (s, 1H).
Next, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (hereinafter, simply referred to as “absorption spectra”) of mBnfBPTzn in a toluene solution and that in a solid thin film and emission spectra thereof were measured. The solid thin film was formed over a quartz substrate by a vacuum evaporation method. The absorption spectra were measured using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers (V-550 manufactured by JASCO Corporation for the solution and U-4100 manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd. for the thin film). Note that the absorption spectrum in the solution was calculated by subtraction of the measured absorption spectrum of only toluene in a quartz cell, and the absorption spectrum in the thin film was calculated using an absorbance (−log10 [% T/(100−% R)]) obtained from a transmittance and a reflectance of a substrate and the thin film. Note that % T represents transmittance and % R represents reflectance. The emission spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FS920 manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Measurement results of the obtained absorption and emission spectra in the toluene solution are shown in FIG. 18A, in which the horizontal axis represents wavelength and the vertical axes represent absorption intensity and emission intensity. Measurement results of the absorption and emission spectra in the solid thin film are shown in FIG. 18B, in which the horizontal axis represents wavelength and the vertical axes represent absorption intensity and emission intensity.
FIG. 18A shows that mBnfBPTzn in the toluene solution has absorption peaks at around 284 nm, 314 nm, 327 nm, and 342 nm, and emission wavelength peaks at 348 nm, 362 nm, and 379 nm. FIG. 18B shows that mBnfBPTzn in the solid thin film has absorption peaks at around 217 nm, 260 nm, 316 nm, 330 nm, and 347 nm, and an emission wavelength peak at 416 nm (an excitation wavelength of 330 nm).
The ionization potential of mBnfBPTzn in the thin film state was measured in the air with a photoelectron spectrometer (AC-3 manufactured by Riken Keiki Co., Ltd.). The obtained value was converted into a negative value, so that the HOMO level of mBnfBPTzn was −6.17 eV. From the data of the absorption spectrum in the thin film in FIG. 18B, the absorption edge of mBnfBPTzn, which was obtained from Tauc plot with an assumption of direct transition, was 3.49 eV. Thus, the optical energy gap of mBnfBPTzn in the solid state can be estimated to be 3.49 eV; from the values of the HOMO level obtained above and this energy gap, the LUMO level of mBnfBPTzn can be estimated to be −2.68 eV. This reveals that mBnfBPTzn in the solid state has an energy gap as wide as 3.49 eV.
Next, mBnfBPTzn obtained in this example was subjected to an analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In the LC-MS analysis, liquid chromatography (LC) separation was carried out with UltiMate 3000 manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K., and mass spectrometry (MS) was carried out with Q Exactive manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific K.K. In the LC separation, a given column was used at a column temperature of 40° C., and solution sending was performed in such a manner that an appropriate solvent was selected, the sample was prepared by dissolving mBnfBPTzn in an organic solvent at an arbitrary concentration, and the injection amount was 5.0 μL. In the MS analysis, ionization was carried out by an electrospray ionization (ESI) method, and measurement was carried out using Full MS-SIM. The Full MS-SIM measurement was carried out in a mass range of m/z=150 to nm/z=2000, and detection was performed in a positive mode. The obtained MS spectrum is shown in FIG. 19.
The results in FIG. 19 show m/z=602, which corresponds to the sum of the exact mass of mBnfBPTzn and the mass of a proton. This confirms that mBnfBPTzn was obtained.
Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) of mBnfBPTzn was performed. A high vacuum differential type differential thermal balance (TG/DTA 2410SA, manufactured by Bruker AXS K.K.) was used for the measurement. The measurement was carried out under a nitrogen stream (a flow rate of 200 mL/min) and a normal pressure at a temperature rising rate of 10° C./min. From the relationship between weight and temperature (thermogravimetry), it has been found that mBnfBPTzn has a 5% weight-loss temperature of 462° C., which is indicative of high heat resistance of mBnfBPTzn.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also performed on mBnfBPTzn. For the calorimetry, Pyris 1 DSC manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc. was used. In the differential scanning calorimetry, after the temperature was raised from −10° C. to 300° C. at a temperature rising rate of 40° C./min, the temperature was held for a minute and then lowered to −10° C. at a temperature decreasing rate of 40° C./min. This operation was the first measurement. Then, the same operation with the temperature rising and decreasing rates changed to 10° C./min was performed as the second measurement, and the second measurement result was employed. The DSC measurement shows that the glass transition point of mBnfBPTzn is 97° C. In addition, the measurement was also performed on 2-{3-[3-(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)phenyl]phenyl}-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (abbreviation: mDBtBPTzn). The measurement shows that the glass transition point of mDBtBPTzn is 81° C. and is lower than that of mBnfBPTzn. This reveals that mBnfBPTzn has higher heat resistance than mDBtBPTzn.

After the stirring, toluene and water were added to the mixture, and the resulting mixture was stirred. Then, the aqueous layer of the mixture was subjected to extraction with toluene. The solution of the obtained extract and the organic layer were combined and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The obtained organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate. This mixture was gravity-filtered, and the obtained filtrate was concentrated to give a black oily substance. The oily substance was purified by silica gel column chromatography (using a developing solvent of toluene:hexane=5:1) to give a solid. The obtained solid was purified by HPLC and washed with hexane to give 0.19 g of a target white solid in a yield of 24%.
By a train sublimation method, 0.19 g of the obtained white solid was purified under a pressure of 3.4 Pa at 280° C.

Note that FIG. 20B is a chart where the range of from 7.20 ppm to 9.20 ppm in FIG. 20A is enlarged. These results reveal that the organic compound of one embodiment of the present invention, mBnfBPTzn-02 represented by Structural Formula (121), was obtained in this example.
1H NMR (CDCl3, 300 MHz): δ=7.44-7.64 (m, 9H), 7.68-7.82 (m, 4H), 7.84-8.07 (m, 3H), 8.10 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 8.13 (s, 1H), 8.34 (t, d=1.5 Hz, 1H), 8.47 (dd, J1=5.7 Hz, J2=1.8 Hz, 1H), 8.68 (d, J=8.1 Hz, 1H), 8.78-8.82 (m, 5H), 9.12 (t, d=2.1 Hz, 1H).
Next, an ultraviolet-visible absorption spectrum (hereinafter, simply referred to as “absorption spectrum”) of mBnfBPTzn-02 in a toluene solution and an emission spectrum thereof were measured. The absorption spectrum was measured using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (V-550 manufactured by JASCO Corporation). Note that the absorption spectrum in the solution was calculated by subtraction of the measured absorption spectrum of only toluene in a quartz cell. The emission spectrum was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (FS920 manufactured by Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.). Measurement results of the obtained absorption and emission spectra in the toluene solution are shown in FIG. 21, in which the horizontal axis represents wavelength and the vertical axes represent absorption intensity and emission intensity.
FIG. 21 shows that mBnfBPTzn-02 in the toluene solution has absorption peaks at around 285 nm, 317 nm, and 342 nm, and emission wavelength peaks at 368 nm and 381 nm.
Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) of mBnfBPTzn-02 was performed. The measurement was carried out under a nitrogen stream (a flow rate of 200 mL/min) and a normal pressure at a temperature rising rate of 10° C./min. From the relationship between weight and temperature (thermogravimetry), it has been found that rBnfBPTzn-02 has a 5% weight-loss temperature of 444° C., which is indicative of high heat resistance of mBnfBPTzn-02.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was also performed on mBnfBPTzn-02 using Pyris 1 DSC manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc. In the differential scanning calorimetry, after the temperature was raised from −10° C. to 300° C. at a temperature rising rate of 40° C./min, the temperature was held for a minute and then lowered to −10° C. at a temperature decreasing rate of 40° C./min. This operation was the first measurement. The same operation with the temperature rising and decreasing rates changed to 10° C./min was performed as the second measurement, and the second measurement result was employed. The DSC measurement shows that the glass transition point of mBnfBPTzn-02 is 111° C. In contrast, the glass transition point of mDBtBPTzn is 81° C. and is lower than that of mBnfBPTzn-02. This reveals that mBnfBPTzn-02 has higher heat resistance than mDBtBPTzn.

<<Fabrication of Light-Emitting Elements>>
In each of the light-emitting elements described in this example, as illustrated in FIG. 22, a hole-injection layer 911, a hole-transport layer 912, a light-emitting layer 913, an electron-transport layer 914, and an electron-injection layer 915 were stacked in this order over a first electrode 901 formed over a substrate 900, and a second electrode 903 was stacked over the electron-injection layer 915.
First, the first electrode 901 was formed over the substrate 900. The electrode area was set to 4 mm2 (2 mm×2 mm). A glass substrate was used as the substrate 900. The first electrode 901 was formed to a thickness of 70 nm using indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide (ITSO) by a sputtering method.
As pretreatment, a surface of the substrate was washed with water, baking was performed at 200° C. for 1 hour, and then UV ozone treatment was performed for 370 seconds. After that, the substrate was transferred into a vacuum evaporation apparatus where the pressure had been reduced to approximately 10−4 Pa, and was subjected to vacuum baking at 170° C. for 60 minutes in a heating chamber of the vacuum evaporation apparatus, and then the substrate was cooled down for about 30 minutes.
Next, the hole-injection layer 911 was formed over the first electrode 901. After the pressure in the vacuum evaporation apparatus was reduced to 10−4 Pa, the hole-injection layer 911 was formed by co-evaporation to have a mass ratio of 1,3,5-tri(dibenzothiophen-4-yl)benzene (abbreviation: DBT3P-II) to molybdenum oxide of 4:2 and a thickness of 60 nm.
Then, the hole-transport layer 912 was formed over the hole-injection layer 911. The hole-transport layer 912 was formed to a thickness of 20 nm by evaporation of 4-phenyl-4'-(9-phenylfluoren-9-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: BPAFLP).
Next, the light-emitting layer 913 was formed over the hole-transport layer 912.
The light-emitting layer 913 in the light-emitting element 1 was formed by co-evaporation using mBnfBPTzn as a host material, using PCBBiF as an assist material, and using [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] as a guest material (phosphorescent material) to have a weight ratio of mBnfBPTzn to PCBBiF and [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] of 0.7:0.3:0.05. The thickness was set to 20 nm. Furthermore, mBnfBPTzn, PCBBiF, and [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] were deposited by co-evaporation to have a mass ratio of mBnfBPTzn:PCBBiF:[Ir(dppm)2(acac)] of 0.8:0.2:0.05. The thickness was set to 20 nm. Accordingly, the light-emitting layer 913 had a stacked-layer structure with a thickness of 40 nm.
The light-emitting layer 913 in the comparative light-emitting element 2 was formed by co-evaporation using mDBtBPTzn as a host material, using PCBBiF as an assist material, and using [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] as a guest material (phosphorescent material) to have a weight ratio of mDBtBPTzn to PCBBiF and [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] of 0.7:0.3:0.05. The thickness was set to 20 nm. Furthermore, mDBtBPTzn, PCBBiF, and [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] were deposited by co-evaporation to have a mass ratio of mDBtBPTzn:PCBBiF:[Ir(dppm)2(acac)] of 0.8:0.2:0.05. The thickness was set to 20 nm. Accordingly, the light-emitting layer 913 had a stacked-layer structure with a thickness of 40 nm.
Next, the electron-transport layer 914 was formed over the light-emitting layer 913. The electron-transport layer 914 in the light-emitting element 1 was formed in the following manner: mBnfBPTzn and bathophenanthroline (abbreviation: Bphen) were sequentially deposited by evaporation to thicknesses of 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively. The electron-transport layer 914 in the comparative light-emitting element 2 was formed in the following manner: mDBtBPTzn and bathophenanthroline (abbreviation: Bphen) were sequentially deposited by evaporation to thicknesses of 20 nm and 10 nm, respectively.
Then, the electron-injection layer 915 was formed over the electron-transport layer 914. The electron-injection layer 915 was formed to a thickness of 1 nm by evaporation of lithium fluoride (LiF).
After that, the second electrode 903 was formed over the electron-injection layer 915. The second electrode 903 was formed using aluminum to a thickness of 200 nm by an evaporation method. In this example, the second electrode 903 functioned as a cathode.
Through the above steps, the light-emitting elements in each of which the EL layer was provided between a pair of electrodes over the substrate 900 were fabricated. The hole-injection layer 911, the hole-transport layer 912, the light-emitting layer 913, the electron-transport layer 914, and the electron-injection layer 915 described above were functional layers forming the EL layer of one embodiment of the present invention. Furthermore, in all the evaporation steps in the above fabrication method, evaporation was performed by a resistance-heating method.
Each of the light-emitting elements fabricated as described above was sealed using another substrate (not illustrated) in such a manner that the substrate (not illustrated) was fixed to the substrate 900 with a sealing material in a glove box containing a nitrogen atmosphere, a sealant was applied so as to surround the light-emitting element formed over the substrate 900, and then irradiation with 365-nm ultraviolet light at 6 J/cm2 was performed and heat treatment was performed at 80° C. for 1 hour.
<<Operation Characteristics of Light-Emitting Elements>>
Operation characteristics of the fabricated light-emitting elements were measured. Note that the measurement was performed at room temperature (in an atmosphere kept at 25° C.). The results are shown in FIGS. 23 to 26.
Table 2 shows initial values of main characteristics of the light-emitting elements at around 1000 cd/m2.

The above results show that the light-emitting element 1 fabricated in this example has high current efficiency and high external quantum efficiency. Note that the comparative light-emitting element 2 exhibits comparably favorable characteristics. The results reveal that favorable element characteristics can be obtained in the case of having not only a structure common to mBnfBPTzn and mDBtBPTzn but also a structure in which two benzene rings are fused to a heteroaromatic ring.
FIG. 27 shows emission spectra when current at a current density of 25 mA/cm2 was applied to the light-emitting element 1 and the comparative light-emitting element 2. As shown in FIG. 27, the emission spectrum of each of the light-emitting element 1 and the comparative light-emitting element 2 has a peak at around 584 nm that is derived from light emission of the organometallic complex [Ir(dppm)2(acac)] contained in the light-emitting layer 913.
Next, reliability tests were performed on the light-emitting element 1 and the comparative light-emitting element 2. FIG. 28 shows results of the reliability tests. In FIG. 28, the vertical axis represents normalized luminance (%) with an initial luminance of 100%, and the horizontal axis represents driving time (h) of the elements. Note that in the reliability tests, the light-emitting elements were driven under the conditions where the initial luminance was set to 5000 cd/m2 and the current density was constant.
These results reveal that the light-emitting element of one embodiment of the present invention (the light-emitting element 1) is comparable to the comparative light-emitting element 2 in current efficiency and external quantum efficiency, but is superior thereto in reliability.
As a result of a comparison between structures of mBnfBPTzn and mDBtBPTzn, it can be understood that the improvement in reliability of mBnfBPTzn is attributable to the benzonaphthofuran structure in which dibenzofuran (where two benzene rings are fused to a heteroaromatic ring) is further fused.

The above results show that the light-emitting element 3 fabricated in this example has high current efficiency and high external quantum efficiency. Note that the comparative light-emitting element 4 exhibits comparably favorable characteristics. The results reveal that favorable element characteristics can be obtained in the case of having not only a structure common to mBnfBPTzn and mDBtBPTzn but also a structure in which two benzene rings are fused to a heteroaromatic ring (dibenzofuran or dibenzothiophene).
FIG. 33 shows emission spectra when current at a current density of 25 mA/cm2 was applied to the light-emitting element 3 and the comparative light-emitting element 4. As shown in FIG. 33, the emission spectrum of each of the light-emitting element 3 and the comparative light-emitting element 4 has a peak at around 546 nm that is derived from light emission of the organometallic complex [Ir(tBuppm)2(acac)] contained in the light-emitting layer 913.
Next, reliability tests were performed on the light-emitting element 3 and the comparative light-emitting element 4. FIG. 34 shows results of the reliability tests. In FIG. 34, the vertical axis represents normalized luminance (%) with an initial luminance of 100%, and the horizontal axis represents driving time (h) of the elements. Note that in the reliability tests, the light-emitting elements were driven under the conditions where the initial luminance was set to 5000 cd/m2 and the current density was constant.
