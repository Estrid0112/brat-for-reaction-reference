BACKGROUND
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition can cause cancer cell growth arrest. However, pan-HDAC inhibition leads to significant adverse effects, and an alternative HDAC inhibition profile is desirable.
HDAC6 is a Class IIb HDAC and is known to remove acetyl groups from many cellular proteins, including α-tubulin and HSP90. It has been reported that HSP90 hyperacetylation destabilizes its target proteins, including ER and EGFR. Inhibitors of HDAC6 have demonstrated anti-cancer proliferative activity in various cancer types. Blocking HDAC6 activity has been shown to cause cancer cell growth inhibition through various mechanisms.
B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20) is a glycosylated phosphoprotein expressed on the surface of all B-cells. CD20 enables a B-cell immune response against antigens. CD20 is targeted by CD20 inhibitory antibodies. CD20 inhibitory antibodies can treat a B-cell disorder, including cancer, an autoimmune disorder, or a transplant rejection.
Due to the dose-limiting toxicities of current pan-selective HDAC inhibitors, there is an ongoing need for improved methods for the treatment of cancer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The present disclosure is directed to methods of using a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody for the treatment of a B-cell disorder. Provided herein are methods for treating a B-cell disorder in a patient in need thereof comprising administering an HDAC inhibitor (e.g., a compound of Formula I) and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. Also provided herein are combination products and pharmaceutical combinations comprising an HDAC inhibitor (e.g., a compound of Formula I) and a CD20 inhibitory antibody.
Definitions
Listed below are definitions of various terms used in this disclosure. These definitions apply to the terms as they are used throughout this specification and claims, unless otherwise limited in specific instances, either individually or as part of a larger group.
As used in the specification and in the claims, the term “comprising” may include the embodiments “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of.” The terms “comprise(s),” “include(s),” “having,” “has,” “may,” “contain(s),” and variants thereof, as used herein, are intended to be open-ended transitional phrases, terms, or words that require the presence of the named ingredients/steps and permit the presence of other ingredients/steps. However, such description should be construed as also describing compositions or processes as “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of” the enumerated compounds, which allows the presence of only the named compounds, along with any pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and excludes other compounds.
The term “about” generally indicates a possible variation of no more than 10%, 5%, or 1% of a value. For example, “about 25 mg/kg” will generally indicate, in its broadest sense, a value of 22.5-27.5 mg/kg, i.e., 25±2.5 mg/kg.
The term “alkyl” refers to saturated, straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbon moieties containing, in certain embodiments, between one and six, or one and eight carbon atoms, respectively. Examples of C1-6-alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl moieties; and examples of C1-8-alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, heptyl, and octyl moieties.
The number of carbon atoms in an alkyl substituent can be indicated by the prefix “Cx-y,” where x is the minimum and y is the maximum number of carbon atoms in the substituent. Likewise, a Cx chain means an alkyl chain containing x carbon atoms.
The term “aryl” refers to a mono- or poly-cyclic carbocyclic ring system having one or more aromatic rings, fused or non-fused, including, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, idenyl, and the like.
The term “heteroaryl” refers to a mono- or poly-cyclic (e.g., bi-, or tri-cyclic or more) fused or non-fused, moieties or ring system having at least one aromatic ring, having from five to ten ring atoms of which one ring atom is selected from S, O, and N; zero, one or two ring atoms are additional heteroatoms independently selected from S, O, and N; and the remaining ring atoms are carbon. Heteroaryl includes, but is not limited to, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, isooxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiophenyl, furanyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzooxazolyl, quinoxalinyl, and the like.
The term “halo” refers to a halogen, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.
The term “HDAC” refers to histone deacetylases, which are enzymes that remove the acetyl groups from the lysine residues in core histones, thus leading to the formation of a condensed and transcriptionally silenced chromatin. There are currently 18 known histone deacetylases, which are classified into four groups. Class I HDACs, which include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8, are related to the yeast RPD3 gene. Class II HDACs, which include HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC9, and HDAC10, are related to the yeast Hda1 gene. Class III HDACs, which are also known as the sirtuins are related to the Sir2 gene and include SIRT1-7. Class IV HDACs, which contains only HDAC11, has features of both Class I and II HDACs. The term “HDAC” refers to any one or more of the 18 known histone deacetylases, unless otherwise specified.
The term “HDAC6 selective” means that the compound binds to HDAC6 to a substantially greater extent, such as 5×, 10×, 15×, 20× greater or more, than to any other type of HDAC enzyme, such as HDAC1 or HDAC2. That is, the compound is selective for HDAC6 over any other type of HDAC enzyme. For example, a compound that binds to HDAC6 with an IC50 of 10 nM and to HDAC1 with an IC50 of 50 nM is HDAC6 selective. On the other hand, a compound that binds to HDAC6 with an IC50 of 50 nM and to HDAC1 with an IC50 of 60 nM is not HDAC6 selective.
The term “inhibitor” is synonymous with the term antagonist.
A “CD20 inhibitory antibody” targets B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (CD20). The CD20 inhibitory antibody comprises three heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and three light chain CDRs that bind to CD20. The CD20 inhibitory antibody can comprise a heavy chain variable region and a light chain variable region, which include the respective CDRs. The CD20 inhibitory antibody can comprise a heavy chain and a light chain, which include the respective variable regions. For example, a CD20 inhibitory antibody includes, but is not limited to, obinutuzumab, ocaratuzumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, rituximab, TRU-015, and veltuzumab.
As used herein, the term “treatment” or “treating” indicates that the method has, at the least, mitigated the B-cell disorder. A method for treating comprises applying or administering to the subject a pharmaceutical combination comprising an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. A method for treating comprises applying or administering to an isolated tissue or cell line from a subject (e.g., for diagnosis or ex vivo applications), who has a B-cell disorder (e.g., cancer, an autoimmune disorder, transplant rejection) a pharmaceutical combination comprising an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. The purpose of application or administration of the pharmaceutical combination is to treat, cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect B-cell disorder. Such treatments may be specifically tailored or modified, based on knowledge obtained from the field of pharmacogenomics. The methods of the disclosure can, at the least, mitigate abnormal cellular proliferation. For example, the method can reduce the rate of cancer growth in a patient, or prevent the continued growth or spread of the cancer, or even reduce the overall reach of the cancer.
As used herein, the term “patient,” “individual,” or “subject” refers to a human or a non-human mammal. Non-human mammals include, for example, livestock and pets, such as ovine, bovine, porcine, canine, feline and murine mammals. Preferably, the patient, subject or individual is human.
As used herein, the term “autoimmune disorder” occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy cells in the body by mistake. An autoimmune disorder includes, for example, anti-N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis, autoimmune anemia, autoimmune pancreatitis, bullous skin disorders, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Evans syndrome, Graves' ophthalmopathy, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), IgG4-related disease, pure red cell aplasia, multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease), opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome (OMS), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), type 1 diabetes mellitus, and vasculitis. In yet another embodiment, the vasculitis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Wegner's granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis (MPA).
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively non-toxic, i.e., the material may be administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base moiety to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present disclosure include the conventional non-toxic salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present disclosure may be synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts may be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1985, p. 1418 and Journal of Pharmaceutical Science, 66, 2 (1977), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
As used herein, the term “composition” or “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of at least one compound useful within the invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to a patient or subject. Multiple techniques of administering a compound exist in the art including, but not limited to, intravenous, oral, aerosol, parenteral, ophthalmic, pulmonary and topical administration.
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or carrier, such as a liquid or solid filler, stabilizer, dispersing agent, suspending agent, diluent, excipient, thickening agent, solvent or encapsulating material, involved in carrying or transporting a compound useful within the invention within or to the patient such that it may perform its intended function. Typically, such constructs are carried or transported from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Each carrier must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation, including the compound useful within the invention, and not injurious to the patient.
The term “combination,” “therapeutic combination,” “pharmaceutical combination,” or “combination product” as used herein refer to either a fixed combination in one dosage unit form, or a non-fixed combination in separate dosage units, or a kit of parts for the combined administration where two or more therapeutic agents may be administered independently, at the same time, at substantially different times, or separately within time intervals, especially where these time intervals allow that the combination partners show a cooperative, e.g., synergistic, effect.
The term “combination therapy” refers to the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single formulation having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in separate formulations (e.g., capsules and/or intravenous formulations) for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential or separate manner, either at approximately the same time or at different times. Such administration also encompasses each component being formulated as a separate formulation that can be administered at different times. For example, the CD20 inhibitory antibody rituximab can be dosed every week, every 21 days, every 28 days, or every two months while the HDAC inhibitor of Formula I can, for example, be dosed daily. In any case, the treatment regimen of the drug combination will provide beneficial effects in treating the conditions or disorders described herein.
The term “sub-therapeutically effective amount” or “sub-therapeutic dose” is an amount or dose of the active ingredient (e.g., an HDAC6 selective inhibitor or a CD20 inhibitory antibody), that, when administered to a patient by itself, does not completely inhibit over time the biological activity of the intended target.
The term “synergistic effect” refers to the action of two agents, such as, for example, an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody, producing an effect, for example, slowing the symptomatic progression of a B-cell disorder, such as, for example, cancer, an autoimmune disorder, or transplant rejection, or symptoms thereof, which is greater than the simple addition of the effects of each drug administered alone. A synergistic effect can be calculated, for example, using suitable methods such as the Sigmoid-Emax equation (Holford, N. H. G. and Scheiner, L. B., Clin. Pharmacokinet. 6: 429-453 (1981)), the equation of Loewe additivity (Loewe, S. and Muischnek, H., Arch. Exp. Pathol Pharmacol. 114: 313-326 (1926)) and the median-effect equation (Chou, T. C. and Talalay, P., Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22: 27-55 (1984) and Chou, Pharmacol. Rev. 58: 621-681 (2006). Each equation referred to above can be applied to experimental data to generate a corresponding graph to aid in assessing the effects of the drug combination. The corresponding graphs associated with the equations referred to above are the concentration-effect curve, isobologram curve and combination index curve, respectively. In some embodiments, the combinations described herein exhibit a synergistic effect (i.e., greater than additive effect) in the treatment of cancer. In further embodiments, the combinations described herein exhibit a synergistic effect (i.e., greater than additive effect) in the treatment of B-Cell disorders.
As used herein, the term “resistant” or “refractive” to a therapeutic agent when referring to a B-cell disorder (e.g., cancer) patient means that the B-cell disorder (e.g., cancer) has innate, or achieved resistance to, the effects of the therapeutic agent as a result of contact with the therapeutic agent. Stated alternatively, the B-cell disorder patient is resistant to the ordinary standard of care associated with the particular therapeutic agent.
As used herein, “treatment naïve” refers to the patient not having previously received treatment with a drug, either investigational or approved, for a B-cell disorder, such as cancer, in particular, a CD20 inhibitory antibody.
Alternatively, patients treated according to the methods of the disclosure may be “treatment experienced.” As used herein, “treatment experienced” refers to a patient who has had at least one previous course of a B-cell disorder therapy, in particular a CD20 inhibitory antibody. In some embodiments, the last dose in this previous course occurred at least three months prior to implementing a method according to the present disclosure.

The subject considered herein is typically a human. However, the subject can be any mammal for which treatment is desired. Thus, the methods described herein can be applied to both human and veterinary applications.
Administration/Dose
In some embodiments, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor (a compound of Formula I) is administered simultaneously with the CD20 inhibitory antibody. Simultaneous administration typically means that both compounds enter the patient at precisely the same time. However, simultaneous administration also includes the possibility that the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody enter the patient at different times, but the difference in time is sufficiently miniscule that the first administered compound is not provided the time to take effect on the patient before entry of the second administered compound. Such delayed times typically correspond to less than 1 minute, and more typically, less than 30 seconds. In one example, wherein the compounds are in solution, simultaneous administration can be achieved by administering a solution containing the pharmaceutical combination of compounds. In another example, simultaneous administration of separate solutions, one of which contains the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the other of which contains the CD20 inhibitory antibody, can be employed. In one example wherein the compounds are in solid form, simultaneous administration can be achieved by administering a composition containing the pharmaceutical combination of compounds. Alternatively, simultaneous administration can be achieved by administering two separate compositions, one comprising the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the other comprising the CD20 inhibitory antibody.
In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical combination of compounds exhibits a synergistic effect (i.e., greater than additive effect) in the treatment of a B-cell disorder, such as a cancer, an autoimmune disorder, or a transplant rejection. The term “synergistic effect” refers to the action of two agents, such as, for example, an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody, producing an effect, for example, slowing the symptomatic progression of cancer or symptoms thereof, which is greater than the simple addition of the effects of each drug administered by themselves. A synergistic effect can be calculated, for example, using suitable methods such as the Sigmoid-Emax equation (Holford, N. H. G. and Scheiner, L. B., Clin. Pharmacokinet. 6: 429-453 (1981)), the equation of Loewe additivity (Loewe, S. and Muischnek, H., Arch. Exp. Pathol Pharmacol. 114: 313-326 (1926)) and the median-effect equation (Chou, T. C. and Talalay, P., Adv. Enzyme Regul. 22: 27-55 (1984)). Each equation referred to above can be applied to experimental data to generate a corresponding graph to aid in assessing the effects of the drug combination. The corresponding graphs associated with the equations referred to above are the concentration-effect curve, isobologram curve and combination index curve, respectively.
The HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody can be administered independently, at the same time or separately within time intervals, wherein these time intervals allow that the combination partners show a cooperative, e.g., synergistic, effect.
In an embodiment, when the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are not administered simultaneously, the two agents exhibit a synergistic effect. In some embodiments, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor is administered before the CD20 inhibitory antibody. In other embodiments, the CD20 inhibitory antibody is administered before the HDAC6 selective inhibitor. The time difference in non-simultaneous administrations can be greater than 1 minute, five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, 60 minutes, two hours, three hours, six hours, nine hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, and 7 months. In other embodiments, the first administered compound is provided time to take effect on the patient before the second administered compound is administered. Generally, the difference in time does not extend beyond the time for the first administered compound to complete its effect in the patient, or beyond the time the first administered compound is completely or substantially eliminated or deactivated in the patient. In another embodiment, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are administered at different times.
In some embodiments, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are together formulated as a single formulation.
In other embodiments, the HDAC inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are each formulated as separate formulations.
In some embodiments, one or both of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are administered in a therapeutically effective amount or dosage. A “therapeutically effective amount” is an amount of an HDAC6 selective inhibitor (a compound of Formula I or II) or of a CD20 inhibitory antibody that, when administered to a patient by itself, effectively treats cancer. An amount that proves to be a “therapeutically effective amount” in a given instance, for a particular subject, may not be effective for 100% of subjects similarly treated for the disease or condition under consideration, even though such dosage is deemed a “therapeutically effective amount” by skilled practitioners. The amount of the compound that corresponds to a therapeutically effective amount is strongly dependent on the type of cancer, stage of the cancer, the age of the patient being treated, and other facts. In general, therapeutically effective amounts of these compounds are well-known in the art, such as provided in the supporting references cited above.
In other embodiments, one or both of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody are administered in a sub-therapeutically effective amount or dosage. A sub-therapeutically effective amount is an amount of HDAC6 selective inhibitor (a compound of Formula I or II) or a CD20 inhibitory antibody that, when administered to a patient by itself, does not completely inhibit over time the biological activity of the intended target.
Thus, in one embodiment, an HDAC6 selective inhibitor or a CD20 inhibitory antibody are administered in an amount that would not be effective when one or both of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody is administered alone, but which amounts are effective in combination.
Whether administered in therapeutic or sub-therapeutic amounts, the pharmaceutical combination of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody should be effective in treating cancer. For example, a sub-therapeutic amount of a compound of the CD20 inhibitory antibody can be an effective amount if, when combined with a compound of Formula I (HDAC6 selective inhibitor), the pharmaceutical combination is effective in the treatment of cancer.
In certain embodiments of the disclosure, the pharmaceutical combinations and methods include an HDAC6 selective inhibitor of Formula I and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the pharmaceutical combinations and methods include Compound A and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical combinations and methods include Compound B and a CD20 inhibitory antibody. These embodiments exhibit synergy such that sub-therapeutic amounts of the HDAC6 selective inhibitor or of the CD20 inhibitory antibody may be used. In certain embodiments of the disclosure, the pharmaceutical combinations and methods include an HDAC6 selective inhibitor (Compound A or Compound B) and a CD20 inhibitory antibody.
In different embodiments, depending on the pharmaceutical combination and the effective amounts used, the pharmaceutical combination of compounds can inhibit cancer growth, achieve cancer stasis, or even achieve substantial or complete cancer regression.
While the amounts of an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody should result in the effective treatment of cancer, the amounts, when combined, are preferably not excessively toxic to the patient (i.e., the amounts are preferably within toxicity limits as established by medical guidelines). In some embodiments, either to prevent excessive toxicity and/or provide a more efficacious treatment of cancer, a limitation on the total administered dosage is provided. Typically, the amounts considered herein are per day; however, half-day and two-day or three-day cycles also are considered herein.
Different dosage regimens may be used to treat cancer. In some embodiments, a daily dosage, such as any of the exemplary dosages described above, is administered once, twice, three times, or four times a day for three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten days. Depending on the stage and severity of the cancer, a shorter treatment time (e.g., up to five days) may be employed along with a high dosage, or a longer treatment time (e.g., ten or more days, or weeks, or months, or longer) may be employed along with a low dosage. For example, the CD20 inhibitory antibody can be dosed every week, every 21 days, every 28 days, every two months, every 16 weeks, or every 24 weeks. In some embodiments, a once- or twice-daily dosage is administered every other day. In some embodiments, each dosage contains both an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody to be delivered as a single dosage, while in other embodiments, each dosage contains either an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody to be delivered as separate dosages.
The HDAC6 selective inhibitors, the CD20 inhibitory antibodys, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or solvate forms, in pure form or in an appropriate pharmaceutical composition, can be administered via any of the accepted modes of administration or agents known in the art. The compounds can be administered, for example, orally, nasally, parenterally (intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous), topically, transdermally, intravaginally, intravesically, intracistemally, or rectally. The dosage form can be, for example, a solid, semi-solid, lyophilized powder, or liquid dosage forms, such as for example, tablets, pills, soft elastic or hard gelatin capsules, powders, solutions, suspensions, suppositories, aerosols, or the like, preferably in unit dosage forms suitable for simple administration of precise dosages. A particular route of administration is oral, particularly one in which a convenient daily dosage regimen can be adjusted according to the degree of severity of the disease to be treated.
As discussed above, the HDAC6 selective inhibitor and the CD20 inhibitory antibody of the pharmaceutical combination can be administered in a single unit dose or separate dosage forms. Accordingly, the phrase “pharmaceutical combination” includes a combination of two drugs in either a single dosage form or separate dosage forms, i.e., the pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients described throughout the application can be combined with an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody in a single unit dose, as well as individually combined with an HDAC6 selective inhibitor and a CD20 inhibitory antibody when these compounds are administered separately.
Auxiliary and adjuvant agents may include, for example, preserving, wetting, suspending, sweetening, flavoring, perfuming, emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms is generally provided by various antibacterial and antifungal agents. Isotonic agents may also be included. Prolonged absorption of an injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption. The auxiliary agents also can include wetting agents, emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and antioxidants.
Solid dosage forms can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and others well-known in the art. They can contain pacifying agents and can be of such composition that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedded compositions that can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compounds also can be in microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. Such dosage forms are prepared, for example, by dissolving, dispersing, etc., the HDAC6 selective inhibitors or CD20 inhibitory antibodys described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier to thereby form a solution or suspension.
Generally, depending on the intended mode of administration, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions will contain about 1% to about 99% by weight of the compounds described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and 99% to 1% by weight of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. In one example, the composition will be between about 5% and about 75% by weight of a compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, with the rest being suitable pharmaceutical excipients.
Actual methods of preparing such dosage forms are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. Reference is made, for example, to Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa., 1990).

Example 3: HDAC Enzyme Assays
Compounds for testing were diluted in DMSO to 50 fold the final concentration and a ten point three fold dilution series was made. The compounds were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA, 20 μM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine) to 6 fold their final concentration. The HDAC enzymes (purchased from BPS Biosciences) were diluted to 1.5 fold their final concentration in assay buffer. The dipeptide substrate and trypsin at 0.05 μM final concentration were diluted in assay buffer at 6 fold their final concentration. The final enzyme concentrations used in these assays were 3.3 ng/ml (HDAC1), 0.2 ng/ml (HDAC2), 0.08 ng/ml (HDAC3) and 2 ng/ml (HDAC6). The final substrate concentrations used were 16 μM (HDAC1), 10 μM (HDAC2), 17 μM (HDAC3) and 14 μM (HDAC6). Five al of compound and 20 μl of enzyme were added to wells of a black, opaque 384 well plate in duplicate. Enzyme and compound were incubated together at room temperature for 10 min. Five al of substrate was added to each well, the plate was shaken for 60 seconds and placed into a Victor 2 microliter plate reader. The development of fluorescence was monitored for 60 min. and the linear rate of the reaction was calculated. The IC50 was determined using Graph Pad Prism by a four parameter curve fit.
Example 4: Combination Treatment with Compound A and Rituximab in Burkitt's Lymphoma Cells
CB. 17 SCID mice were implanted with 1×107 Raji tumor cells subcutaneously in the flank. Raji tumor cells are from a human lymphoblast tissue (B lymphocyte cells) and model Burkitt's Lymphoma. When tumors reach an average size of 100-150 mm3, mice were treated with vehicle, Compound A (Cmpd A, 50 mg/kg, IP, qd×28), rituximab (10 mg/kg, iv, biweekly), or the combination of Compound A and rituximab for up to 4 weeks. Tumors were measured by caliper biweekly and tumor volumes were calculated as length×width2/2. Mice were euthanized when their tumor volumes reached 2000 mm3. Tumor volume was monitored until the first mouse was euthanized. FIG. 1A shows tumor growth kinetics after treatment with the indicated drugs and antibodies. The combination treatment (Compound A and rituximab) significantly inhibited tumor growth. FIG. 1B shows the percentage of tumor volume change. This was calculated as tumor volume relative to average volume of the vehicle group on day 1 (100%). Combination treatment significantly reduced tumor volumes relative to each single agent. That is, the combination treatment with Compound A and rituximab showed synergistic effects in a model of Burkitt's Lymphoma in comparison to each single agent treatment.
Example 5: Compound A in Raji Cells
Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Compound A (i.e., 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1.0 μM, 2.0 μM, and 4.0 μM) for 48 hours and processed for cell surface abundance of CD20 protein and mRNA in Raji cells. The treated Raji cells were stained for IgG2bK-APC and CD20-APC. FACS histogram plots of a representative sample in Raji cells for each concentration are shown in FIG. 2A. The dotted line indicates median of DMSO treatment. The quantification of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) following cell surface staining and flow cytometry of Raji cells is shown in FIG. 2B. Each sample was background subtracted, where the IgG2bK-APC median MFI in Raji cells was used as the background. FIG. 2C shows the cell viability as measured by percentage of cells in live gate, relative to DMSO in Raji cells. FIG. 2D shows CD20 mRNA expression relative to RPLP1 in Raji cells. Together, increased CD20 expression triggered by Compound A can be a potential mechanism for the in vivo combination effect on the Raji cell model. Compound A induced CD20 mRNA expression and cell surface abundance of CD20 on Raji cells. That can be a potential mechanism for the synergistic effect of Compound A with rituximab.
Example 6: Compound A in Jeko Cells
Cells were treated with increasing concentrations of Compound A (i.e., 0.25 μM, 0.5 μM, 1.0 μM, 2.0 μM, and 4.0 μM) for 48 hours and processed for cell surface abundance of CD20 protein and mRNA in Jeko cells. The treated Jeko cells were stained for IgG2bK-APC and CD20-APC. FACS histogram plots of a representative sample in Jeko cells for each concentration are shown in FIG. 3A. The dotted line indicates median of DMSO treatment. The quantification of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) following cell surface staining and flow cytometry of Jeko cells is shown in FIG. 3B. Each sample was background subtracted, where the IgG2bK-APC median MFI in Jeko cells was used as the background. FIG. 3C shows the cell viability as measured by percentage of cells in live gate, relative to DMSO in Jeko cells. FIG. 3D shows CD20 mRNA expression relative to RPLP1 in Jeko cells. Compound A induced CD20 mRNA expression and cell surface abundance of CD20 on Jeko cells. That can be a potential mechanism for the synergistic effect of Compound A with rituximab.
