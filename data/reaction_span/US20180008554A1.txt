BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is a member of the CD28 superfamily that delivers negative signals upon interaction with its two ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2. PD-1 and its ligands are broadly expressed and exert a wide range of immunoregulatory roles in T cells activation and tolerance. PD-1 and its ligands are involved in attenuating infectious immunity and tumor immunity, and facilitating chronic infection and tumor progression.
Modulation of the PD-1 pathway has therapeutic potential in various human diseases (Hyun-Tak Jin et al., Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. (2011), 350:17-37). Blockade of the PD-1 pathway has become an attractive target in cancer therapy. Therapeutic antibodies that block the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint pathway prevent T-cell down regulation and promote immune responses against cancer. Several PD-1 pathway inhibitors have shown robust activity in various phases of clinical trials (R D Harvey, Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2014); 96(2), 214-223).
Accordingly, agents that block the interaction of PD-L1 with either PD-1 or CD80 are desired. Some antibodies have been developed and commercialized. However there is still a need for alternative compounds such as small molecules which may have advantageous characteristics in term of oral administration, stability, bioavailability, therapeutic index, and toxicity. A few patent applications disclosing non-peptidic small molecules have been published (WO 2015/160641, WO 2015/034820, and WO 2017/066227 from BMS; WO 2015/033299 and WO 2015/033301 from Aurigene; WO 2017/070089, US 2017/0145025 and WO 2017/106634 from Incyte) However, there remains a need for alternative small molecules useful as inhibitors of the PD-1 pathway.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE
Abbreviation and Definitions
The terms “a,” “an,” or “the” as used herein not only include aspects with one member, but also include aspects with more than one member. For instance, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a cell” includes a plurality of such cells and reference to “the agent” includes reference to one or more agents known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.
The terms “about” and “approximately” shall generally mean an acceptable degree of error for the quantity measured given the nature or precision of the measurements. Typical, exemplary degrees of error are within 20 percent (%), preferably within 10%, and more preferably within 5% of a given value or range of values. Alternatively, and particularly in biological systems, the terms “about” and “approximately” may mean values that are within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold and more preferably within 2-fold of a given value. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate unless stated otherwise, meaning that the term “about” or “approximately” can be inferred when not expressly stated.
The term “alkyl”, by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight or branched chain hydrocarbon radical, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e. C1-8 means one to eight carbons). Examples of alkyl groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, and the like.

Similarly, the terms “heteroalkenyl” and “heteroalkynyl” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, an alkenyl group or alkynyl group, respectively, that contains the stated number of carbons and having from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of O, N, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N and S may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group.
The term “heteroalkylene” by itself or as part of another substituent means a divalent radical, saturated or unsaturated or polyunsaturated, derived from heteroalkyl, as exemplified by -CH2-CH2-S-CH2CH2- and -CH2-S-CH2-CH2-NH-CH2-, -O-CH2-CH═CH-, -CH2-CH═C(H)CH2-O-CH2- and -S-CH2-C≡C-. For heteroalkylene groups, heteroatoms can also occupy either or both of the chain termini (e.g., alkyleneoxy, alkylenedioxy, alkyleneamino, alkylenediamino, and the like).
The terms “alkoxy,” “alkylamino” and “alkylthio” (or thioalkoxy) are used in their conventional sense, and refer to those alkyl groups attached to the remainder of the molecule via an oxygen atom, an amino group, or a sulfur atom, respectively. Additionally, for dialkylamino groups, the alkyl portions can be the same or different and can also be combined to form a 3-7 membered ring with the nitrogen atom to which each is attached. Accordingly, a group represented as -NRaRb is meant to include piperidinyl, pyrrolidinyl, morpholinyl, azetidinyl and the like.

A heteroaryl group can be attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom. It is understood that the recitation for C5-10 heteroaryl, refers to a heteroaryl moiety having from 5 to 10 ring members where at least one of the ring members is a heteroatom. Non-limiting examples of aryl groups include phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl, while non-limiting examples of heteroaryl groups include pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimindinyl, triazinyl, quinolinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, phthalaziniyl, benzotriazinyl, purinyl, benzimidazolyl, benzopyrazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzisoxazolyl, isobenzofuryl, isoindolyl, indolizinyl, benzotriazinyl, thienopyridinyl, thienopyrimidinyl, pyrazolopyrimidinyl, imidazopyridines, benzothiaxolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, indolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, isothiazolyl, pyrazolyl, indazolyl, pteridinyl, imidazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiadiazolyl, pyrrolyl, thiazolyl, furyl, thienyl and the like.

Carbocylic moieties with multiple ring structure (e.g. bicyclic) can include a cycloalkyl ring fused to a aromatic ring (e.g. 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene). Thus, carboclicic rings include cyclopentyl, cyclohexenyl, naphthyl, and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl. The term “heterocyclic ring” refers to both “heterocycloalkyl” and “heteroaryl” moieties. Thus, heterocyclic rings are saturated or unsaturated and can be aromatic. Generally, heterocyclic rings are 4 to 10 ring members and include piperidiyl, tetrazinyl, pyrazolo, and indolyl.
For brevity, the term “aryl” when used in combination with other terms (e.g., aryloxy, arylthioxy, arylalkyl) includes both aryl and heteroaryl rings as defined above. Thus, the term “arylalkyl” is meant to include those radicals in which an aryl group is attached to an alkyl group (e.g., benzyl, phenethyl, pyridylmethyl and the like).
The above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “aryl” and “heteroaryl”), in some embodiments, will include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated radical. Preferred substituents for each type of radical are provided below. For brevity, the terms aryl and heteroaryl will refer to substituted or unsubstituted versions as provided below, while the term “alkyl” and related aliphatic radicals is meant to refer to unsubstituted version, unless indicated to be substituted.
Substituents for the alkyl radicals (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, alkynyl and cycloalkyl) can be a variety of groups selected from: -halogen, -OR', -NR'R″, -SR', -SiR'R″R'″, -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -CONR'R″, -OC(O)NR'R″, -NR″C(O)R', -NR'-C(O)NR″R'″, -NR″C(O)2R', -NH-C(NH2)═NH, -NR'C(NH2)═NH, -NH-C(NH2)═NR', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R″, -NR'S(O)2R″, -CN and -NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2 m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical.

When R' and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R″ is meant to include 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. The term “acyl” as used by itself or as part of another group refers to an alkyl radical wherein two substitutents on the carbon that is closest to the point of attachment for the radical is replaced with the substitutent ═O (e.g., -C(O)CH3, -C(O)CH2CH2OR' and the like).
Similarly, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are varied and are generally selected from: -halogen, -OR', -OC(O)R', -NR'R″, -SR', -R', -CN, -NO2, -CO2R', -CONR'R″, -C(O)R', -OC(O)NR'R″, -NR″C(O)R', -NR″C(O)2R', -NR'-C(O)NR″R'″, -NH-C(NH2)═NH, -NR'C(NH2)═NH, -NH-C(NH2)═NR', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R″, -NR'S(O)2R″, -N3, perfluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy, and perfluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and where R', R″ and R'″ are independently selected from hydrogen, C1-8 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl, C2-8 alkenyl, C2-8 alkynyl, unsubstituted aryl and heteroaryl, (unsubstituted aryl)-C1-4 alkyl, and unsubstituted aryloxy-C1-4 alkyl.

Example 48: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay-ELISA
Plates were coated with 1 μg/mL of human PD-L1 (obtained from R&D) in PBS overnight at 4° C. The wells were then blocked with PBS containing 2% BSA in PBS (W/V) with 0.05% TWEEN-20 for 1 hour at 37° C. The plates were washed 3 times with PBS/0.05% TWEEN-20 and the samples were diluted to 1:5 in dilution medium in the ELISA plates. Human PD-1 and biotin 0.3 μg/mL (ACRO Biosystems) were added and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. then washed 3 times with PBS/0.05% TWEEN-20. A second block was added with PBS containing 2% BSA in PBS (W/V)/0.05% TWEEN-20 for 10 min at 37° C. and was washed 3 times with PBS/0.05% TWEEN-20. Streptavidin-HRP was added for 1 hour at 37° C. then washed 3 times with PBS/0.05% TWEEN-20. TMB substrate was added and reacted for 20 min at 37° C. A stop solution (2 N aqueous H2SO4) was added. The absorbance was read at 450 nm using a micro-plate spectrophotometer. The results are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
