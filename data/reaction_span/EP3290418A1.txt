FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a series of JAK inhibitors, in particular to compounds of Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
JAK belongs to a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6. The present invention also provides methods for the production of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases involving inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6 by administering a compound of the present invention.
Janus kinases (JAK) are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine signaling from membrane receptors to STAT transcription factors. Four JAK family members are described in the prior art: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, JAK family members auto- and/or transphosphorylate each other, followed by phosphorylation of STATs and then migrate to the nucleus to modulate transcription. JAK-STAT intracellular signal transduction is suitable for the interferons, most interleukins, as well as a variety of cytokines and endocrine factors such as EPO, TPO, GH, OSM, LIF, CNTF, GM-CSF and PRL (Vainchenker W. et al. (2008)).
The combination of genetic models and small molecule JAK inhibitor research revealed the therapeutic potential of several JAKs. JAK2 gene mutation research is one of the breakthrough progress of hematological research in recent years. Myeloproliferative diseases (MPD) are disclosed in the prior art, including polycythemia vela (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and idiopathicmyelofibrosis (IMF), which are malignant diseases caused by the lesions of a group of hematopoietic stem cell lesion. A JAK2 point mutation (JAK2V617F) in this group of diseases was discovered by the researchers in 2005, which led to a new era in MPD diagnosis and treatment. JAK2V617 is a point mutation that occurs at exon v617 at exon 14, and valine (V) is substituted by phenylalanine (F). In the structure of JAK2, JH1 is the kinase domain; and Va1617 is located in JH2 adjacent to JH1, which is a pseudokinase domain, binds to JH1 and inhibits its activation. V617F mutations cause JH2 to lose inhibitory effect on JH1 kinase activity, leading to sustained activation of JAK2, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation [Kilpivaara 0, Levine RL. JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloprolifer-ative neoplasms: discovery and science. Leukemia. 2008; 22(10):1813-7]. There is a high incidence of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with polycythaemia vera, essential thrombocythaemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. It was determined by Allele-Specific PCR that, the incidence of JAK2V617F mutation in patients with polycythaemia vera was 90%; in patients with essential thrombocythaemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis was 50%-60% [Baxter EJ, Scott LM, Campbell PJ, et al. Lancet. 2005; 365 (9464): 1054-61]. The molecular basis of these diseases without finding JAK2 mutation in patients lacking of V617F mutation is unclear. In 2007, an exon 12 mutation was found in JAK2V617F-negative MPD patients. This mutation can also cause JH2 to lose inhibitory effect on JH kinase activity, which provides molecular markers and genetic mechanisms for JAK2V617F-negative patients with myeloproliferative diseases[Scott LM, Tong W, Levine RL, et al. JAK2 exon 12 mutations in polycythemia vera and idiopathic erythrocytosis. NEngl J Med 2007;356:459-68Â·]. In normal physiological conditions, JAK2 mediates signal transduction of various cytokines, including erythropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, interleukin-3 and growth factor, and regulates and promotes cell proliferation. JAK2 gene plays an important role in adjustment of hematopoietic, and its downstream STAT family is a family of proteins that bind to DNA. The STAT family couples with JAK phosphorylated signaling pathway (JAK-STAT signaling pathway) and play a role in the regulation of transcription. JAK-STAT can directly correlate extracellular signals with gene expression regulation, initiate transcription and expression of responsive genes, complete the signal transduction process of cytokine receptors such as erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) and thrombopoietin receptor (MPL/TPOR), resulting in cell proliferation effects.

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts of the compound of the present invention, which are prepared from the compounds having particular substituent found by the present invention with relatively nontoxic acids or bases. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting a sufficient amount of the base with the neutral form of such compounds, either in a neat solution or in a suitable inert solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include sodium, lithium, calcium, ammonium, organic ammonium, magnesium, and the like. When compounds of the present invention contain relatively basic functionalities, acid addition salts can be obtained by contacting a sufficient amount of the acid with the neutral form of such compounds, either in a neat solution or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those derived from inorganic acids like hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, monohydrogencarbonic, phosphoric, monohydrogenphosphoric, dihydrogenphosphoric, sulfuric, monohydrogensulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like, as well as the salts derived from organic acids like acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic, and the like.

Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
Preferably, the neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" belongs to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but not limited to, inorganic or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compounds formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include, but not limited to, those derived from salts of inorganic or organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, hydroxy, hydroxynaphthoic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicylic, stearic, subacetic, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, tannic, tartaric, and p-toluenesulfonic acids.

Certain compounds of the present invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds. The racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are all intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from: Maehr, J. Chem. Ed. 1985, 62: 114-120. Unless specified otherwise, wedges and broken lines are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include both E and Z geometric isomers. All tautomers are encompassed by the present invention as well.
The compounds of the present invention may exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The present invention takes into account all such compounds, including cis- and trans isomers, (-)- and (+)- pair enantiomers, R- and S- enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixture thereof, such as the enriched mixture of either the enantiomers or the diastereomers, as being covered within the scope of this invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.
Optically-active R-and S- enantiomers, and (D)-, and (L)-isomers may be prepared by chiral synthesis, or by chiral reagents, or by any other conventional techniques. If an enantiomer of a certain compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantionmers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by resolution means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantionmers. Additionally, the separation of the enantionmers and diastereomers can be generally accomplished by using chromatography which using chiral stationary phase and optionally in combination with a chemical derivatization method (e.g. the formation of carbamates from amines).
The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be labeled by using radioactive isotopes, such as tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I), or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carriers" refers to any formulation or carrier medium capable of delivering an effective amount of the active substance of the present invention without interfering with the biological activity of the active substance and having no toxic side effects to the host or patient. The representative carriers include water, oils, vegetables and minerals, cream base, lotion matrix, ointment matrix, and the like. These matrices include suspending agents, tackifiers, transdermal enhancers, and the like, the formulations of which are well known to those skilled person in the art of cosmetics or local medicines. Regarding additional information about the carriers, refer to the content in "Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005)" which are hereby incorporated by reference.
The term "excipient" generally refers to the carrier, diluent and/or medium required by preparation of an effective pharmaceutical composition.
For the drug or pharmacologically active agent, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. For the oral dosage in the present invention, the "effective amount" of an active substance in the composition refers to the amount required to achieve the desired effect when used in combination with another active substance in the composition. The effective amount will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, depending on the particular active agent as well. Thus, it is not always possible to specify an exact "effective amount". However, an appropriate "effective" amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art in accordance with conventional experimentation.
The terms "active ingredient", "therapeutic agent", "active substance" or "active agent" mean a chemical entity which is effective in treating a target disorder, disease or condition.
The term "substituted" means that any one or more hydrogen atoms on the designated atom is replaced with substituent, provided that the designated atom's valency is normal, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When the substituent is keto (i.e.,=O), then two hydrogen atoms are substituted. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The term "optionally substituted" means that it may be substituted or may not be substituted, unless specified otherwise, the type and number of substituents may be optionally on the chemically achievable basis.
When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than one time in constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
When one of the variables is selected from a single bond, it indicates that the two groups to which they are attached are directly connected, for example, when L in A-L-Z represents a single bond, the structure is actually A-Z.
When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. For example, the structural unitorindicates that it can be substituted at any position on the cyclohexyl group or the cyclohexadiene group.
Substituents for the alkyl, and heteroalkyl radicals are generally referred to as "alkyl substituents", and they can be one or more of the following groups selected from, but not limited to: -R', -OR', =O, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', halogen, -SiR'R"R''', OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', NR'C(O)NR"R''',-NR"C(O)2R',-NR'''''-C(NR'R"R''')=NR'''', NR''''C(NR'R")=NR''', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R",NR"SO2R',-CN,-NO2, -N3,-CH(Ph)2, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), wherein m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' each preferably independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or aryalkyl groups. When a compound of the present invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R" is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF3 and -CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH3, -C(O)CF3, -C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).

When a compound of the present invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' groups when more than one of these groups is present.
Unless specified otherwise, two of the aryl substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -T-C(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein T and U are independently selected from -NR-, -O-, CRR'- or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH2)r-B-, wherein A and B are independently -CRR'-, -O-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, -S(O)2NR'- or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. Optionally, one of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of the aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -(CRR')s-X-(CR"R''')d-, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X is -O-, NR'-, -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2-, or -S(O)2NR'-. The substituent R, R', R" and R''' are preferably independently selected from hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6) alkyl.
The terms "halo" or "halogen", by themselves of as part of another substituent, mean, unless specified otherwise, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl", are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term "halo(C1-C4)alkyl" is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like. Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, and pentachloroethyl.

Unless specified otherwise, the term "hetero" means a heteroatom or heteroatom radical (i.e., an atomic radical containing a heteroatom), including atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and atomic radical containing such heteroatoms, for example, including oxygen(O), nitrogen(N), sulfur(S), silicon(Si), germanium(Ge), aluminum(Al), boron(B), -O-, -S-, =O, =S, -C(=O)O-, -C(C=O)-, -S(=O), -S(=O)2-, and optionally substituted -C(=O)N(H)-, -N(H)-, -C(=NH)-, -S(=O)2N(H- or -S(=O)N(H)-.
Unless specified otherwise, "cyclo" refers to a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, heterocycloalkynyl, aryl or heteroaryl. The ring includes monocyclic ring, bicyclic ring, spiro ring, or bridged ring. The number of atoms on the ring is usually defined as the number of membered ring, for example, "5- to 7-membered ring" refers to the surrounding arrangement of 5 to 7 atoms. Unless specified otherwise, the ring optionally contains from 1 to 3 heteroatoms. Thus, the term "5- to 7-membered ring" includes such as phenyl, pyridyl and piperidinyl. On the other hand, the term "5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring" includes pyridyl and piperidinyl, but does not include phenyl. The term "cyclo" also includes cyclic system containing at least one ring, in which each "cyclo" independently meets the above definition.
Unless specified otherwise, the term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclic group" is intended to mean a stable monocyclic or bicyclic or tricyclic ring, including heteroatom or heteroatom radical, which is saturated, partially unsaturated or fully unsaturated (aromatic), and which consists of carbon atoms and from 1, 2, 3 or 4 cyclic heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S; and including any bicyclic group in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (NO, and S(O)p). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic ring described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocyclic system" or "heteroaryl group" is intended to mean a stable 5, 6, 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic ring, and which consists of carbon atoms and from 1, 2, 3 or 4 cyclic heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (NO, and S(O)p). It is noted that the total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1. Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring forms when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms.
