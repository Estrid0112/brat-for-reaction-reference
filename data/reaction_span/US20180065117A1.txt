BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present disclosure relates to a solid-supported palladium(II) complex which catalyzes the Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction and a method of employing the solid-supported palladium(II) complex to synthesize cinnamic acid and derivatives thereof.
Description of the Related Art
The “background” description provided herein is for the purpose of generally presenting the context of the disclosure. Work of the presently named inventors, to the extent it is described in this background section, as well as aspects of the description which may not otherwise qualify as prior art at the time of filing, are neither expressly or impliedly admitted as prior art against the present disclosure.
Among metal catalysts, palladium complexes have been used widely due to their versatility in modern organic synthesis (e.g. in synthetic transformations including Mizoroki-Heck, Suzuki, Stille and Sonogashira cross coupling reactions) (J. H. Kim, J. S. Park, H. W. Chung, B. W. Boote, T. R. Lee, RSC Adv. 2 (2012) 3968-3977; B. Tamami, H. Allahyari, S. Ghasemi, F. Farjadian, J. Organomet. Chem. 696 (2011) 594-599; A. F. Lee, P. J. Ellis, I. J. S. Fairlamb, K. Wilson, Dalton Trans. 39 (2010) 10473-10482; and X. Gao, N. Zhao, M. Shu, S. Che, Appl. Catal. A: Gen. 388 (2010) 196-201, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).
Homogeneous palladium catalysts, however, suffer from the problems associated with the need and handling of sensitive ligands. Such catalysts are also difficult to recover and to separate from the coupling products, making it a challenge to recycle the expensive palladium.
The separation and recycling of homogeneous transition metal catalysts remain the most serious scientific and commercial challenges in the area of catalysis. The difficulty in the separation and recycling processes of the transition metal catalysts has limited their practical uses for application in the fine chemical industry (Herrmann,W. A.; Cornils, B. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 1997, 36, 1048; Baker, R. T.; Tumas, W. Science 1999, 284, 1477; Cole-Hamilton, D. J. Science 2003, 299, 1702; and Herrmann, W. A. Applied Homogeneous Catalysis with Organometallic Compounds; Cornils, B., Herrmann, W. A., Eds.; VCH: Weinheim, Germany, 1996; Vol. 2, p 712, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).
Therefore, many strategies for effective catalyst recycling have been explored, including supported aqueous-phase catalysis, fluorous-phase catalysis, and the use of ionic liquids and supercritical fluids (Arhanchet, J. P.; Davis, M. E.; Merola, J. S.; Hanson, B. E. Nature 1989, 339, 454; Davis, M. E. CHEMTECH 1992, 498; Sandee, A. J.; Slagt, V. F.; Reek, J. N. H.; Kamer, P. C. J.; van Leeuwen, P. W. N. M. Chem.

Rev. 1999, 99, 475; Leitner, W. Acc. Chem. Res. 2002, 35, 746, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).
Hence, the support of homogeneous catalysts and the application of supported catalysts in fine chemical synthesis has become a major area of research in chemistry due to the advantages of such catalysts over the homogeneous catalysts and the positive impact on the environment (Clark, J. H.; Macquarrie, D. J. Handbook of Green Chemistry and Technology; Blackwell: Oxford, 2002; and Anastas, P. T.; Kirchhoff, M. M.; Williamson, T. C. Appl. Catal., A 2001, 221, 3, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). Therefore, there is a demand to develop heterogeneous palladium catalysts for industrial applications.
The Mizoroki-Heck reaction is among the most important and widely used reactions for the formation of carbon-carbon bond, which allows the arylation, alkylation or vinylation of various alkenes through their reaction with aryl, vinyl, benzyl, or allyl halides in the presence of palladium and a suitable base in a single step under mild conditions (Beletskaya, I. P.; Cheprakov, A. V. Chem. Rev. 2000, 100, 3009; Mizoroki-Heck, R. F. Palladium Reagents in Organic Synthesis; Academic: London, 1985; Trzeciak, A. M.; Ziolkowski, J. J. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2005, 249, 2308; and Alonso, F.; Beletskaya, I. P.; Yus, M. Tetrahedron 2005, 61, 11771, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). There are some examples of the application of the Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction on the industrial scale (Eisenstadt, A.; Ager, D. J. Fine Chemicals through Heterogeneous Catalysis; Sheldon, R. A., van Bekkum, H., Eds.; Wiley-VCH: Weinheim, 2001; p 576; and Zapf, A.; Beller, M. Top. Catal. 2002, 19, 101; and Tucker, C. E.; de Vries, J. G. Top. Catal. 2002, 19, 111, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety). 15257466Therefore, an objective of the present disclosure is to provide a solid-supported palladium(II) catalyst effective for Mizoroki-Heck coupling reactions. It is a further objective to provide a method of employing the solid-supported palladium(II) catalyst.

In one embodiment, the solid-supported catalyst is placed in a bag and the bag is immersed in the reaction mixture. Accordingly, the solid-supported catalyst remains in the bag until the coupling reaction is completed.
The progress of each reaction may be monitored by methods known to those skilled in the art, such as thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared spectroscopy, and high pressure liquid chromatography combined with ultraviolet detection or mass spectroscopy. Preferably, thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy are used.
Under the basic reaction conditions, cinnamate (instead of cinnamic acid) and derivatives thereof may be obtained. The cinnamate and derivatives thereof may be converted to the acid form by adding a mineral acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid) during the reaction work up.

The phrase “recycling the solid-supported catalyst” refers to a process whereby the solid-supported catalyst is first washed by an organic solvent, dried, and then added to a new batch of reactants (either for the same or a different type of coupling reaction). Preferred organic solvents for washing the solid-supported catalyst and/or dialysis may include, without limitation, methanol, acetone, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, ether, glycol ether, acetamide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or combinations thereof. The solid-supported catalyst may be dried in vacuum, and/or with heating, for example, the catalyst may be dried in a vacuum oven. Dried solid-supported catalyst may be stored in a desiccator until the next run.
In one embodiment, the solid-supported catalyst is recycled for at least 2 runs, preferably at least 10 runs, more preferably at least 20 runs, even more preferably at least 30 runs. The catalyst may lose less than 5 wt %, preferably less than 2 wt %, more preferably less than 0.1 wt % of palladium (based on an initial amount of palladium present in the solid-supported catalyst) after the solid-supported catalyst is used for at least 2 runs, preferably at least 10 runs, more preferably at least 20 runs, even more preferably at least 30 runs. The yield of the coupling reaction may decrease less than 20 percentage points, preferably less than 10 percentage points, more preferably 5 percentage points after the solid-supported catalyst is used for at least 2 runs, preferably at least 10 runs, more preferably at least 20 runs, even more preferably at least 30 runs. The turnover number and the turnover frequency of the solid-supported catalyst may decrease less than 10%, preferably less than 5%, more preferably less than 2% after the solid-supported catalyst is used for at least 2 runs, preferably at least 10 runs, more preferably at least 20 runs, even more preferably at least 30 runs.
Having generally described this disclosure, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.
EXAMPLE 1
Reagents and Experimental Methods
Materials for the synthesis of the solid-supported ligand and palladium complex were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received. All solvents used in the synthesis were distilled before their use. 4-Benzyl chloride functionalized silica gel (200-400 mesh, extent of labelling: 1.2 mmol/g loading) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Solid state NMR spectral data was recorded using CP-MAS on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz machine. IR spectra were recorded in wavenumbers (cm−1) using FT-IR spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer 16F model). Elemental analyses were performed on Perkin Elmer Series 11 (CHNS/O) Analyzer 2400. Palladium loading was estimated using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, X-series 2 ICP-MS, thermos scientific. Thermal stability of the solid-supported ligands and complexes were established using thermogravimetric (TG) (Perkin-Elmer TGA 7, US) analysis at a heating rate of 10° C. min−1 through to 700° C. under nitrogen atmosphere. The morphology of the supports, solid-supported ligands and solid-supported complexes were studied using scanning electron microscope, JEOL JSM6610LV SEM.

Synthesis of Precursor to Ligand, 2,2'-(4-Iodobenzene-1,2-diyl)-bis(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazole) (BOX-1)
<img> id-US20180065117A1-20180308-C00009.TIF </img>
The precursor to the ligand was prepared using an earlier published procedure (M. B. Ibrahim, B. El Ali, M. Fettouhi, L. Ouahab, Appl. Organometal. Chem, 2015, 29, 400, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). A solution of 4-iodophthalonitrile (4.0 mmol) and zinc triflate (5.0 mol %, 0.2 mmol) in dried chlorobenzene (30 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. A solution of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (8.0 mmol) in dry chlorobenzene (5 mL) was slowly added. The temperature was raised to 135° C. and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 24 hours. The solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The crude product was dissolved in 30 mL of dichloromethane and extracted twice with distilled water (2×20 mL). The aqueous layer was then separated and the combined organic layers were dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dichloromethane was removed using a rotary evaporator to obtain the impure product, which was then purified using silica gel column chromatography with dichloromethane/ether (4/1) as eluent.

Synthesis of Hydroxyl Functionalized Bis(Oxazoline) Ligand, 3,4-bis(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)biphenyl-4-ol (BOX-OH)
<img> id-US20180065117A1-20180308-C00010.TIF </img>
The synthesis of hydroxyl functionalized BOX ligand (BOX-OH) has been previously described (U.S. provisional patent application 62/313,849, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).
2,2'-(4-Iodobenzene-1,2-diyl)-bis(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazole) (BOX-1) (0.50 mmol), PdCl2 (0.025 mmol, 5.0 mol %), K2CO3 (1.0 mmol, 2.0 mol equivalent), DMF (2 mL), distilled water (2 mL) and the 4-hydroxy phenylboronic acid (0.6 mmol), were added in a 10 mL round bottom flask. The mixture was stirred at 70° C. for 6 h. After completion of the reaction, the mixture was cooled down and acidified with 1M HCl. The acidified solution was extracted 3 times with EtOAc and the combined EtOAc extract was dried using anhydrous MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using hexane-EtOAc (1:9) as an eluent.
EXAMPLE 4
Synthesis of Solid-Supported Bis(Oxazoline) Ligand (BOX-Si)
<img> id-US20180065117A1-20180308-C00011.TIF </img>
BOX-OH reacted with the benzyl silica support to form the silica immobilized BOX ligand (BOX-Si).
NaH (0.50 mmol) was added in one portion to a stirred solution of 3,4-bis(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)biphenyl-4-ol (BOX-OH) (0.31 mmol) in dry DMF in a dry flask. The mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature and under argon atmosphere. The benzyl silica support (0.30 mmol) was added and the mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 12 h. The solid product was filtered and washed successively with methanol, water, acetone and dichloromethane. The product, benzyl silica-supported BOX ligand (BOX-Si), was dried at room temperature under vacuum.
It is worth mentioning that the ether bond was considered stable and suitable for linking the ligand to the silica support. Whereas most functional groups such as esters and amides can easily be hydrolyzed under the standard conditions of coupling reactions, which involves the use of bases such as KOH and K2CO3 and also heat. The ether linkage is particularly stable to the reaction conditions and thus, expected to prevent leaching of the ligand during the catalytic application.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Benzyl Silica-Supported Palladium(II) Bis(Oxazoline) Catalyst (Pd-BOX-Si)
<img> id-US20180065117A1-20180308-C00012.TIF </img>
The silica immobilized BOX ligand was further reacted with bis(benzonitrile) palladium(II) chloride to produce the silica-supported palladium(II)-bis(oxazoline) catalyst (Pd-BOX-Si).
The silica-supported bis(oxazoline) ligand (BOX-Si) (0.30 mmol, 0.25 g) was stirred in anhydrous toluene for 30 min. A solution of bis(benzonitrile) palladium(II) chloride (0.30 mmol, 0.12 g) in toluene was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at 90° C. for 12 h. The solid product, benzyl silica-supported palladium(II) bis(oxazoline) catalyst (Pd-BOX-Si), was filtered, washed thoroughly with ethanol and dried in a vacuum.
The metal loading of the solid-supported palladium catalyst, which was determined using ICP-MS, was found to be 2.8% and equivalent to 0.30 mmol/g. The palladium loading of the silica-supported dichloridopalladium(II) bis(oxazoline) catalyst was determined using ICP-MS and was found to be 2.8%. This corresponds to 0.3 mmol palladium per gram of the solid-supported catalyst.
The formation of Pd-BOX-Si was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), solid-state cross-polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (CP-MAS 13C NMR), elemental analysis and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Pd-BOX-Si was further characterized with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
EXAMPLE 6
Characterization of Silica-Supported Bis(Oxazoline) Ligand (BOX-Si) and Palladium(II) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using FT-IR
FT-IR analysis of the silica-supported bis(oxazoline) ligand reveals a strong band at 1661 cm−1 (FIG. 1). This band was initially absent in the unmodified benzyl silica support (FIG. 1). This band reflects -C═N- stretching in the oxazoline ring. The appearance of this additional band is an indication that the BOX ligand has been incorporated into the silica support matrix. The -C═N- stretching band shifted to 1643 cm−1 on complexation with palladium (FIG. 1).
EXAMPLE 7
Characterization of Silica-Supported BOX Ligand (BOX-Si) and Palladium(II) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using CP-MAS 13C NMR
The silica-supported ligand and palladium(II) complex were further characterized using solid state 13C NMR. The spectra of the silica bound ligand (FIG. 2) and its palladium(II) complex (FIG. 3) were in entire agreement with those reported for other known bis(oxazoline) and solid-supported bis(oxazoline) ligands and their complexes. For instance, the resonance due to imino carbon (-C═N) was observed at 169.96 ppm in the spectrum of the silica-supported ligand. This band slightly shifted to 170.63 ppm after complexation. The CP-MAS spectra of both the solid-supported ligand and complex showed that the signals for the carbon atoms of the two bis(oxazoline) rings are no longer symmetric comparing to the free ligand and complex.
EXAMPLE 8
Analysis of Silica-Supported Palladium(II)-BOX (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using TGA
The thermal stability for the palladium(II) catalyst (Pd-BOX-Si) was determined using TGA (FIG. 4). The Pd-BOX-Si was found to possess high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 150° C.
EXAMPLE 9
Analysis of Silica-Supported BOX Ligand (BOX-Si) and Palladium(II) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using SEM
In order to assess the morphology of the 4-benzyl chloride functionalized silica support, the silica-supported BOX ligand and palladium(II) catalyst, SEM micrographs were recorded for a pure benzyl chloride silica support, silica-supported bis(oxazoline) ligand (BOX-Si) and silica-supported palladium(II)-bis(oxazoline) catalyst (Pd-BOX-Si). As expected, the smooth and flat surfaces of the 4-benzyl chloride functionalized silica support (FIG. 5), have been broken to a rough and irregular surface after incorporation of the metal complex (FIG. 7) (Trilla, M.; Pleixats, R.; Wong Chi Man, M.; Bied, C.; Moreau, J. J. E. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006, 47, 2399; Trilla, M.; Pleixats, R.; Wong Chi Man, M.; Bield, C.; Moreau, J. J. E. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2008, 350, 577; Gruber-Woelfler, H.; Radaschitz, P. F.; Feenstra, P. W.; Haas, W.; Khinas, J. G. J Catal. 2012, 286, 30; and Antony, R.; Tembe, G. L.; Ravindranathan, M.; Ram, R. N. J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 2003, 90, 370, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).
EXAMPLE 10
Characterization of Silica-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
In the XPS spectrum of Pd-BOX-Si catalyst (FIG. 8), palladium peaks were observed in the range of 335 to 342 eV. Two distinctive 3d peaks were identified. The first peak with binding energy of 336.08 eV (Pd 3d5/2) and the second peak with binding energy 341.38 (Pd 3d3/2). The data is consistent with palladium(II) forms, and this confirmed that palladium(II) is the main form of palladium in the solid-supported catalyst (Yeap, H. N; Mian, W.; Hong, H.; Christina, L. L. C. Chem. Commun., 2009, 5530; and Hajipour, A. R.; Shirdashtzade, Z.; Azizi, G. J. Chem. Sci., 2014, 126, 1, 85, each incorporated herein by reference in their entirety).
EXAMPLE 11
Catalytic Activities of Silica-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) in Mizoroki-Heck Coupling Reaction
The catalytic activity of the new silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst in Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction of various olefins and aryl halides was carefully studied. The cross-coupling reactions of various aryl halides with acrylic acid, methacrylate and acrylamide were considered.
The recycling ability of the new silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalysts in Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction of iodobenzene with methacrylate was investigated (Equation 1 and FIG. 10). Interestingly, the solid-supported catalyst was recycled up to ten times without significant loss in catalytic activity. The turnover number of the silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst was estimated for the 10 runs as 1800, while the turnover frequency was found to be 300/h. In order to confirm the efficiency of the solid-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst, an experiment with a ratio of iodobenzene (10.0 mmol) to solid-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst (0.005 mmol) equal to 2,000 was left to react for 6 hours. A complete conversion of iodobenzene and excellent isolated yield of product 3aa (93%) was observed. The turnover number of the solid-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalysts in the later experiment was estimated as 1,860, while the turnover frequency was found as 310/h.

EXAMPLE 12
Mizoroki-Heck Coupling Reaction of Various Acrylates with Aryl Halides Catalyzed by Silica-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst
The Mizoroki-Heck coupling of a broad range of substrates using DMF-H2O (1:1) as a solvent system and KOH as a base (Equation 2) was performed. Thus, various aryl halides including aryl iodides and aryl bromides were coupled successfully with various with different acrylates (Table 1). The silica-supported catalyst was used in the coupling of aryl halides with acrylate, acrylic acid and acrylamide. At the end of each reaction, the catalyst was removed from the reaction mixture and dialyzed in DMF to remove all traces of reactants and products before taking it to the next catalytic run.
The coupling reactions of aryl halides with methacrylate, acrylic acid and acrylamide were investigated (Table 1). Under the reaction conditions, the acrylates and acrylamides were hydrolyzed to the corresponding salts of the carboxylic acids. The aryl propenoic acids were obtained after acidic work up. Aryl iodides having either activating or deactivating groups reacted smoothly with acrylates to give the cross coupling products in excellent isolated yields (90-96%) (Table 1, entries 1-7). The coupling reactions of aryl bromides were conducted at 100° C., using a fresh catalyst and without dialysis bag. Also, high isolated yields of the coupling products were obtained (84-88%) (Table 1, entries 8-10).

EXAMPLE 13
Characterization of the Used Solid-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) Catalysts
The ability to reuse the solid-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalysts several times and in various reactions without significant loss in their catalytic activities demonstrates their high stabilities. The interesting results realized with the solid-supported catalysts urged the inventors to carry out further investigations to assess any change in the structure of the used catalysts in comparison with the unused catalysts. The catalysts recovered after the 12th run of the Suzuki coupling reaction and the 10thrun of both the Mizoroki-Heck and the Sonogashira coupling reactions were washed successively with distilled water, acetone and methanol. The catalysts were then dried in an oven at 100° C. prior to analysis. The purified catalysts were analyzed with FT-IR, XPS and the amount of palladium was established using ICP-MS.
EXAMPLE 14
Characterization of the Used Silica-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using FT-IR
The catalyst was pressed into pellets with KBr and analyzed using FT-IR. The FT-IR spectrum for the recovered silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) (FIG. 1) catalyst was found to be similar with the spectrum of the unused (fresh) catalyst.
EXAMPLE 15
Analysis of the Used Silica-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) (Pd-BOX-Si) Catalyst Using ICP-MS
The percentage of palladium on Pd-BOX-Si recovered from the Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction of iodobenzene with methacrylate was found to be 2.4%, which is similar to the amount of palladium on the fresh catalyst (2.8%). This result further justifies the high recycling ability observed with the new silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst.
EXAMPLE 16
Analysis of the Used Solid-Supported Palladium-Bis(Oxazoline) Catalysts Using XPS
The XPS spectra of the used silica-supported palladium-bis(oxazoline) catalyst (Pd-BOX-13) (FIG. 9) recovered after the tenth run of the Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction showed that the oxidation state of palladium remained unchanged after the catalysis. Similar to the unused (fresh) solid-supported catalysts, the 3d spectrum resolved into 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 spin orbit pairs with binding energies 334.58 eV and 339.78 eV (Pd-BOX-Si) and 336.18 and 341.68 (Pd-BOX-13) respectively.
EXAMPLE 17
Palladium Leaching Test
The main objective of supporting a catalyst is to ease its separation from the product and to minimize the level of contamination caused by the toxic metal. The leaching of palladium into the products was analyzed using ICP-MS. After the tenth run of the Mizoroki-Heck coupling reaction, a sample from each run of the coupling reaction was taken for the analysis and digested using concentrated nitric acid. In addition, the products of the 10 runs were combined, digested using concentrated nitric acid. All samples were analyzed by ICP-MS.
The results of the ICP-MS analysis indicated that the concentration of palladium in the combined products was below 10 ppb. These results indicated that less than 0.5% of the total palladium on the solid-supported catalysts was leached into the products. These results clearly indicated the high stability of the solid-supported catalysts towards the cross-coupling reactions under the prescribed reaction conditions.
