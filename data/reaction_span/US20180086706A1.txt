FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention describes a hydrate of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride, a preparation method of the same, and a use thereof for the preparation of Ceritinib.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Lung cancer is a globally highest incident malignancy, and the number of patients is increased by a rate of 3% or more per year due to the environmental and other factors. And 80-85% of the diagnosed patients are attacked by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), wherein, 2%-7% of the patients were induced by the rearrangement of the ALK gene, leading to the accelerated growth of cancer cells and deteriorated conditions. Ceritinib is an oral, selective anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, and in clinical studies, breakthrough progress has been obtained in the treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with it. On Apr. 29, 2014, the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in USA approved the use of Ceritinib for the patients with deteriorated condition after the treatment of Xalkori (crizotinib) or the patients with Xalkori intoleranced and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase positive (ALK+) metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The current disclosed literature [J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 5675-5690] discloses a preparation method of Ceritinib (LDK378) as follows:
The synthesis of the key intermediate 4 (2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline) is a very important synthesis step. According to the literature and the current research results, it has been found that impurities in intermediate 4 will be introduced in the final bulk drug, resulting in that the impurity content is difficult to be limited within 0.1% or less. The quality of intermediate 4 is therefore critical to the quality of the final bulk drug. Thus, purification of intermediate 4 is essential, however, the free base form of intermediate 4 is an oily product which cannot be purified by recrystallization, and column chromatography does not meet the requirements of mass production. It is therefore important to find a form by which intermediate 4 can be purified by recrystallization.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The present invention describes a hydrate form of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride as an intermediate of Ceritinib. The present invention further provides a preparation method of a substantially pure hydrate of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride. The substantially pure hydrate of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride means a hydrate of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride that has a purity of 95% or more, or even 98% or more, more preferably 99% or more, and a single impurities of 0.2% by weight or less, more preferably 0.1% by weight or less, wherein 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride is intermediate 4 whose structural formula is as follows:
The present inventors have screened a large amount of salts of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline and corresponding crystal forms thereof, and found that 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline hydrochloride, in particular the hydrate form of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride, has a good crystalline form, and is very suitable for recrystallization purification, further, impurity removal effect is also very good and any single impurity can reach 0.1%.
2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation using the platinum dioxide as reported in the above literature [J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 5675-5690], or, the catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon, and then the corresponding hydrochloride may be produced, otherwise, the hydrochloric acid may be added in the process of catalytic hydrogenation, and the hydrogenation is carried out in a corrosion-resistant reactor, resulting in salt directly. Either the water in the heterogeneous catalyst in the catalytic hydrogenation process, or the water added in the salification process, can result in the generation of the corresponding dihydrochloride hydrate.
The solvent of catalytic hydrogenation is preferably selected from C1-C6 primary alcohols, secondary alcohols and tertiary alcohol solvents, which include, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, t-butanol, pentanol, isopentanol and the like, or a combination solvent of an alcoholic solvent and water. The pressure of the catalytic hydrogenation is in a range from 0.5 to 5 MPa, preferably from 1 to 2 MPa, and the reaction temperature thereof is from room temperature to 280° C.
Ceritinib can be prepared by reacting 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base with a pyrimidine intermediate (WO2008073687), then the Ceritinib bulk drug is obtained (As shown in the following scheme). Pure 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base can be prepared by neutralizing the purified 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride hydrate with a base to dissociate the salt, then 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base is formed.
Alternatively, 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride hydrate is directlly reacted with a pyrimidine intermediate (WO2008073687) to produce the corresponding Ceritinib hydrochloride, the Ceritinib free base is obtained after dissociation. The scheme is as follows:
DETAILS OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides a compound having one mole of water, i.e., 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride monohydrate, the structure formula thereof is as follows:
The present invention further provides a preparation method of 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride monohydrate, comprising the following steps:
(1) dissolving 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitro-phenyl) pyridine in an alcoholic solvent, and reducing by hydrogenating reduction via a noble metal catalyst to obtain 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base;
(2) reacting the 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base with an alcoholic solution of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride.
Preferably,
The noble metal catalyst in step (1) is one or more selected from platinum oxide, palladium on carbon, and rhodium on carbon.
The molar ratio of the 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline free base to the hydrogen chloride in the hydrochloric acid or alcoholic solution of hydrogen chloride in step (2) is 1: 2-1: 10.
The concentration of the alcoholic solution of hydrochloric acid or hydrogen chloride is from 1% to 40%.
The alcohols described in step (1) and step (2) are independently one or more selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, pentanol, 2-pentanol and hexanol.
For the 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl) aniline dihydrochloride hydrate, it was shown in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) that the dehydration temperature of the hydrate is higher than 130° C., and weight loss by drying at 120° C. is not more than 1%; The decomposition point of the compound is higher than 230° C. and the weight loss at 170° C. is not more than 7%. Thus the hydrate contains one mole of water, which is lost at a temperature between about 120 to 180° C.

Preparation of 5-chloro-N-(2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-ylphenyl)-N-2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2,4-diamine (LDK-378)
5-chloro-N-(2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-ylphenyl)-N-2-(isopropylsulfonyl) phenyl)-2,4-diamine dihydrochloride (6.31 g) was added to a 50 mL three-necked flask. 19 g of acetone aqueous solution (3: 1, v/v) was added. The mixture was stirred and heated to 55° C., and 10 g of about 10% aqueous NaOH was added dropwise. After the dripping was complete, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with 42 g of purified water, and continuously stirred for 1 hour. After filtration, the filter cake was collected and dried in vacuum to give 5-chloro-N-(2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-ylphenyl)-N-2-(isopropylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2,4-diamine. Purity is not less than 99%, and a single impurity is not higher than 0.1%.
