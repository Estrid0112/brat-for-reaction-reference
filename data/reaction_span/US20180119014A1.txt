BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to a polymerizable liquid crystal compound for obtaining a retardation film having high front contrast, a polymerizable liquid crystal composition, and a liquid crystal polymerized film.
Description of Related Art
A liquid crystal polymerized film prepared by polymerizing a polymerizable liquid crystal composition can be used as materials of a display device having a film or an element having an optically anisotropic film for a retardation film, an optical compensation film, a reflective film, a selective reflection film, an antireflection film, a viewing angle compensation film, a liquid crystal alignment film, a polarizing element, a circularly polarizing element, and an elliptically polarizing element.
For example, in a liquid crystal display device, a retardation film is used for high quality image display. The liquid crystal polymerized film can be used as a retardation film because it exhibits birefringence. In the related art, a stretched polymer film exhibiting birefringence has been used as a retardation film. For ease of film formation, thinning the film thickness, and improvement in durability, a retardation film using a liquid crystal polymerized film has been studied.
A display device having high contrast can display so that colors close in brightness can be distinguished. Therefore, a display device including a retardation film having high front contrast therein is required for high quality image display. There is an example in which front contrast of a retardation film is improved according to a liquid crystal polymerized film fixed in a smectic phase (Patent Document 1).

<Substrate>
A glass, a plastic, and a metal are a material of a substrate. A surface of the glass or the metal may be processed into a slit shape. The plastic may be subjected to a surface treatment such as a stretching treatment, a hydrophilic treatment, and a hydrophobic treatment.
When a liquid crystal polymerized film having homogeneous alignment and tilt alignment is formed on a substrate, before the polymerizable liquid crystal composition is applied to the substrate, a surface treatment is performed on the substrate to induce alignment of the liquid crystal polymerized film. As the surface treatment, methods of (a) rubbing a substrate, (b) obliquely depositing silicon oxide on a substrate, and (c) providing a polymer coating on a substrate and emitting polarized UV to the polymer coating may be exemplified.
The following procedures are an example of (a) rubbing a substrate.
(1) A rubbing cloth made of a material such as rayon, cotton, or polyamide is wound around a metal roller,
(2) The roller is brought into contact with a substrate, and
(3) The roller is moved parallel to a surface of the substrate while rotating the roller or the substrate is moved while the roller is fixed.
Before rubbing, a polymer coating may be provided on the substrate, and rubbing may be performed on the coating. As the coating, a coating called a rubbing alignment film of polyimide, polyamic acid, or polyvinyl alcohol is used.
According to rubbing, it is possible to prevent an alignment defect of the liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate.
The following procedures are an example of (c) providing a polymer coating on a substrate and emitting polarized UV to the polymer coating.
(1) A polymer coating called a photoalignment film is provided on a substrate,
(2) Linearly polarized light having a wavelength of 250 to 400 nm is emitted to the substrate, and

The photosensitive group is a functional group that causes a chemical reaction according to light absorption. A structural change resulting from isomerization, dimerization, transition, decomposition, or another photoexcitation is the chemical reaction. Since it is possible to prepare a photoalignment film with a small amount of polarized UV emitted, the photosensitive group is preferably a functional group having a chalcone skeleton, a cinnamoyl skeleton, a stilbene skeleton, a cyclobutane skeleton, or an azobenzene skeleton. According to polarized UV emission, it is possible to prevent an alignment defect of the liquid crystal polymerized film and it is possible to prevent an alignment defect due to scraping by rubbing.
<Liquid Crystal Polymerized Film with Substrate>
The liquid crystal polymerized film of the present invention with a substrate is obtained according the following processes.
(1) A polymerizable liquid crystal composition is applied onto a substrate and, as necessary, dried to form a coating film.
(2) While the polymerizable liquid crystal composition is aligned, polymerization occurs according to a method using light, heat, or a catalyst, and a liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate is obtained.
Accordingly, the polymerizable liquid crystal composition in the coating film is fixed while maintaining alignment in a liquid crystal state.
Various coating methods are used for applying a polymerizable liquid crystal composition. In consideration of uniformity of a film thickness of the polymerizable liquid crystal composition on the substrate, as a coating method, a spin coating method, a micro gravure coating method, a gravure coating method, a wire bar coating method, a dip coating method, a spray coating method, a meniscus coating method, and a die coating method are preferable.
In order to remove a solvent, a heat treatment is preferably performed during drying when the liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate is formed. The heat treatment can be performed using a hot plate, a drying furnace, and warm air or hot air blowing.
In order to obtain the liquid crystal polymerized film of the present invention, means such as an electron beam, ultraviolet light, visible light, and infrared radiation can be used. A wavelength range of the radiation emitted in order to obtain the liquid crystal polymerized film is 150 to 500 nm. A preferable light wavelength range is 250 to 450 nm, and a more preferable range is 300 to 400 nm.
As a light source of the light, a low pressure mercury lamp, a high pressure discharge lamp, and a short arc discharge lamp can be used. The low pressure mercury lamp may be a sterilization lamp, a fluorescent chemical lamp, and a black light. The high pressure discharge lamp may be a high pressure mercury lamp and a metal halide lamp. The short arc discharge lamp may be an ultra high pressure mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, and a mercury xenon lamp.
The liquid crystal polymerized film can be disposed inside or outside a liquid crystal cell of a liquid crystal display device. The liquid crystal polymerized film can be disposed inside the liquid crystal cell because then variation in retardation of the liquid crystal polymerized film due to a thermal history is small and an amount of impurities eluted from the liquid crystal polymerized film to a liquid crystal is small.
When the liquid crystal polymerized film is formed using a polarizing plate as a substrate, it is possible to produce a polarizing plate having a function such as optical compensation. For example, when a liquid crystal polymerized film having retardation of ¼ wavelength and a polarizing plate are combined, a circularly polarizing plate can be produced.
An absorptive polarizing plate doped with iodine or a dichroic dye and a reflective polarizing plate such as a wire grid polarizing plate are polarizing plates.
As a method of removing a liquid crystal polymerized film from a liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate and fixing it on another substrate, the following method is known.
(1) A liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate and a basal plate including a pressure-sensitive adhesive layer are bonded together so that the liquid crystal polymerized film and the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer are in contact with each other,
(2) A part in which the liquid crystal polymerized film and the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer are bonded together and in contact with each other is separated between the substrate part of the liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate and the liquid crystal polymerized film, and
(3) The liquid crystal polymerized film on the substrate including the pressure-sensitive adhesive layer is fixed to another substrate in the same manner as in the above (1) and (2).

Example 9
A liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate was prepared according to the following procedures.
Procedure (1) in which a polymerizable liquid crystal composition was applied onto a glass substrate with a polarized UV treated alignment film by spin coating,
Procedure (2) in which the substrate was heated on a hot plate at 80° C. for 3 minutes,
Procedure (3) in which the substrate was then cooled at room temperature for 3 minutes,
Procedure (4) in which it was confirmed that crystals were precipitated from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition, and
Procedure (5) in which light with an constant output of the ultra-high pressure mercury lamp was emitted to a polymerizable liquid crystal composition on the substrate in a direction of 90° at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere and the polymerizable liquid crystal composition on the substrate was polymerized.
This was provided that an optical receiver for measuring an illuminance at a wavelength of about 365 nm was used, and an emission time in the procedure (5) was adjusted to between 5 seconds and 10 seconds so that an amount of light of the ultra-high pressure mercury lamp with which a surface of the polymerizable liquid crystal composition was exposed in the procedure (5) was 500 mJ/cm2.
Example 10
A liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate was prepared for each polymerizable liquid crystal composition. Results of evaluation of the liquid crystal polymerized films with a substrate prepared using the polymerizable liquid crystal compositions are shown in Table 3. In Table 3, “-” indicates that measurement was not performed because crystals were precipitated from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.

When liquid crystal polymerized films with a substrate were prepared using polymerizable liquid crystal compositions (S-1) to (S-5), no crystals were precipitated from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. When liquid crystal polymerized films with a substrate were prepared using polymerizable liquid crystal compositions (SC-2) and (SC-3), crystals were precipitated from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. Therefore, a liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate without an alignment defect were not obtained from the polymerizable liquid crystal composition (SC-2) and Compound (SC-3).
It can be understood that, when the compound (1) of the present invention is contained in a larger amount than the compounds (C-1) and (C-2), it is possible to obtain a liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate without an alignment defect.
Front contrasts of the liquid crystal polymerized films with a substrate prepared using the polymerizable liquid crystal compositions (S-1) to (S-5) were significantly higher than front contrasts of the liquid crystal polymerized films with a substrate prepared using the polymerizable liquid crystal compositions (SC-1), (SC-4), and (SC-5).
Accordingly, it can be clearly understood that, when the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the polymerizable liquid crystal compound of the present invention is used as a part of a raw material, a liquid crystal polymerized film with a substrate having high front contrast is obtained.
