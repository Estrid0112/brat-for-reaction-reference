TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to the medical use of a prostaglandin compound of formula (I) for opening chloride channels. In more detail, the present invention relates to a compound, which can modify transportation of chloride ions.
BACKGROUND ART
It is known that chloride ions (Cl-) not only manage transportation of water/electrolyte, secretion and regulation of cell volume but also play an important role as a factor affecting the response of cells.
For example, the transition of chloride ions into or out of cells concurrently accompanies the transport of water and electrolyte, which results in the regulation of cell volume. Therefore, it is suggested that chloride ions play an important role in the growth and division of cells and the programmed cell death that accompany an abrupt change in the cell volume.
In the brain, it is known that inhibitory regulation works in the central nervous system by maintaining chloride ions in the nerve cells at a low level. It is also known that chloride ions play an important role in inhibiting anxiety and spasm, and regulating sleep, memory and circadian rhythm.
In the bowel, it is known that chloride ions are deeply involved with such pathology as diarrhea and constipation, and when opioid such as morphine is administered to bring abnormal secretions of electrolyte such as chloride ions and fluid, it will cause intractable constipation. Other diseases known to be caused by an abnormality in the balance of chloride ions include myotonia atrophica, diseases showing hypercalciuria such as calculus renum, anxiety, insomnia, cystic fibrosis, epilepsia, anesthesia, asthma, bronchitis and neuropathy.
A chloride channel is an ion-transport membrane protein for transporting chloride ions. It has been reported that various kinds of chloride channels are present in the cell membrane of nerve, muscle and epithelium, and they are involved with various physiological functions and cytophylaxis mechanisms.
For example, a chloride channel named CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) was discovered in trying to find the cause of cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive inheritary disease best known in the Caucasian race. The variation of genes, which is the cause of this disease, occurs in CFTR genes due to the reduced permeability of chloride ions caused by the deficiency in functions of CFTR in the epithelial cells of air duct, pancreas, bowel, perspiratory gland, alimentary tract, etc.
Further, a chloride channel cloned by cramp fish's electric organ and named ClC-0 was later found to form a large family (ClC family). Examples of ClC family are: ClC-1 present in the skeletal muscle of mammals; ClC-2 present in the epithelium of various organs; ClC-3 and ClC-4 distributed in hippocampus, cerebellum, etc.; ClC-5 present in lung, kidney, etc.; ClC-6 and ClC-7 present in brain, testis, skeletal muscle, kidney, etc.; and ClCK-1 and ClCK-2 specifically shown only in kidney. It is known that the abnormality in ClC-1 causes congenital myotonia and the abnormality in ClC-5 causes hereditary nephrolithiasis.
Accordingly, a compound which can open chloride channels and promotes chloride ion transportation are considered to affect on various cell functions and cytophylaxis mechanisms, and also considered to be useful for the treatment of pathology occurring because of abnormal chloride ion balance within or outside the cells due to the reduced permeability of chloride ions by some cause.
Prostaglandins (hereinafter, referred to as PG(s)) are members of class of organic carboxylic acids, which are contained in tissues or organs of human or other mammals, and exhibit a wide range of physiological activity. PGs found in nature (primary PGs) generally have a prostanoic acid skeleton as shown in the formula (A):<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>
On the other hand, some of synthetic analogues of primary PGs have modified skeletons. The primary PGs are classified to PGAs, PGBs, PGCs, PGDs, PGEs, PGFs, PGGs, PGHs, PGIs and PGJs according to the structure of the five-membered ring moiety, and further classified into the following three types by the number and position of the unsaturated bond at the carbon chain moiety:Subscript 1: 13,14-unsaturated-15-OHSubscript 2: 5,6- and 13,14-diunsaturated-15-OHSubscript 3: 5,6-, 13,14-, and 17,18-triunsaturated-15-OH.
Further, the PGFs are classified, according to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 9-position, into α type (the hydroxyl group is of an α-configuration) and β type (the hydroxyl group is of a β-configuration).
PGE1, PGE2 and PGE3 are known to have vasodilation, hypotension, gastric secretion decreasing, intestinal tract movement enhancement, uterine contraction, diuretic, bronchodilation and anti ulcer activities. PGF1α, PGF2α and PGF3α have been known to have hypertension, vasoconstriction, intestinal tract movement enhancement, uterine contraction, lutein body atrophy and bronchoconstriction activities.
It has been reported that PGE1 and PGF2α stimulate secretion of chloride ions in rabbit ileum (Nature vol. 238, 26-27, 1972) and PGE2 induces secretion of chloride ions in human jejunum (Gastroenterology vol. 78, 32-42, 1980). It has been also reported that PGE2 regulates chloride ion transportation in the endometrial epithelial cells (Journal of Physiology vol. 508, 31-47, 1998). Meanwhile, it has been reported that platelet chloride transportation did not respond to PGE1 in cystic fibrosis patients (European Journal of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry vol. 33, No. 6, 329-335, 1995), and a prostaglandin analogue (misoprostol) did not promote chloride secretion in cystic fibrosis patients (American Journal of Human Genetics Vol. 67, No. 6, 1422-1427, 2000).
Further, it has been reported that PGE2 opens a housekeeping basolateral chloride channel of rabbit (Journal of Biological Chemistry, 270(32) 1995). Furthermore, it has been reported that PGE2 and PGF2 α activate chloride conductance in mouse endometrial epithelial cells via CFTR (Biology of Reproduction, 60(2) 1999).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The nomenclature of the PG compounds used herein is based on the numbering system of the prostanoic acid represented in the above formula (A).
The formula (A) shows a basic skeleton of the C-20 carbon atoms, but the present invention is not limited to those having the same number of carbon atoms. In the formula (A), the numbering of the carbon atoms which constitute the basic skeleton of the PG compounds starts at the carboxylic acid (numbered 1), and carbon atoms in the α-chain are numbered 2 to 7 towards the five-membered ring, those in the ring are 8 to 12, and those in the ω-chain are 13 to 20. When the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the α-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 2; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the α-chain, compounds are named as substitution compounds having respective substituents at position 2 in place of the carboxy group (C-1). Similarly, when the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the ω-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 20; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the ω-chain, the carbon atoms beyond position 20 are named as substituents. Stereochemistry of the compounds is the same as that of the above formula (A) unless otherwise specified.
In general, each of the terms PGD, PGE and PGF represents a PG compound having hydroxy groups at positions 9 and/or 11, but in the present specification, these terms also include those having substituents other than the hydroxy group at positions 9 and/or 11. Such compounds are referred to as 9-dehydroxy- 9-substituted-PG compounds or 11-dehydroxy-11-substituted-PG compounds. A PG compound having hydrogen in place of the hydroxy group is simply named as 9- or 11-dehydroxy-PG compound.
As stated above, the nomenclature of the PG compounds is based on the prostanoic acid skeleton. However, in case the compound has a similar partial structure as a prostaglandin, the abbreviation of "PG" may be used. Thus, a PG compound of which α-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 9 carbon atoms in the α-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(2-carboxyethyl)-PG compound. Similarly, a PG compound having 11 carbon atoms in the α-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(4-carboxybutyl)-PG compound. Further, a PG compound of which ω-chain is extended by two carbon atoms, that is, having 10 carbon atoms in the ω-chain is named as 20-ethyl-PG compound. These compounds, however, may also be named according to the IUPAC nomenclatures.
Examples of the analogs (including substituted derivatives) or derivatives include a PG compound of which carboxy group at the end of α-chain is esterified; a compound of which α-chain is extended; physiologically acceptable salt thereof; a compound having a double bond at 2-3 position or a triple bond at position 5-6, a compound having substituent (s) at position 3, 5, 6, 16, 17, 18, 19 and/or 20; and a compound having lower alkyl or a hydroxy (lower) alkyl group at position 9 and/or 11 in place of the hydroxy group.
According to the present invention, preferred substituents at position 3, 17, 18 and/or 19 include alkyl having 1-4 carbon atoms, especially methyl and ethyl. Preferred substituents at position 16 include lower alkyl such as methyl and ethyl, hydroxy, halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine, and aryloxy such as trifluoromethylphenoxy. Preferred substituents at position 17 include lower alkyl such as methyl and ethyl, hydroxy, halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine, aryloxy such as trifluoromethylphenoxy. Preferred substituents at position 20 include saturated or unsaturated lower alkyl such as C1-4 alkyl, lower alkoxy such as C1-4 alkoxy, and lower alkoxy alkyl such as C1-4 alkoxy-C1-4 alkyl. Preferred substuents at position 5 include halogen atoms such as chlorine and fluorine. Preferred substituents at position 6 include an oxo group forming a carbonyl group. Stereochemistry of PGs having hydroxy, lower alkyl or hydroxy(lower)alkyl substituent at position 9 and/or 11 may be α, β or a mixture thereof.
Further, the above analogs or derivatives may be compounds having an alkoxy, cycloalkyl, cycloalkyloxy, phenoxy or phenyl group at the end of the ω-chain where the chain is shorter than the primary PGs.

Test Example 1
(Method)
Whole cell patch clamp method was used to assess the effect of compound 1 (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGEJ and compound 2 (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-18 (S) -methyl-PGE1) on recombinant hClC-2 chloride channel. In this example, effects of the respective compounds on Human Epithelial Kidney (HEK) cells transfected with human ClC-2 (hClC-2) were examined, and the results were compared with those on non-transfected HEK cells.
ClC-2 transfected human epithelial kidney (HEK) cells were prepared and used. HEK-293 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were transfected with His- and T7-tagged human ClC-2 cDNA in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (GIBCO/Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine (GIBCO/Invitrogen) for 5 h at 37°C in serum-free medium. Cells were then resuspended in the serum-containing medium and cultured in the presence of 300 µg/ml G-418 (GIBCO/Invitrogen). The surviving cells were then expanded, tested to confirm expression of Cl- current and ClC-2 mRNA, and the cells expressing ClC-2 mRNA were frozen to store. Upon studies, the stored cells were thawed and maintained at 37°C in 5%/95% CO2/O2 in MEM (GIBCO/Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% inactivated horse serum, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate.
In the whole cell patch clamp measurements, currents were elicited by voltage clamp pulses (1500 ms duration) between +40 mV and -140 mV, in 20 mV increments, from the beginning holding potential of -30 mV. Currents were measured 50-100 ms after start of the pulse. The external solution was normal Tyrode solution containing 135 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5.4 mM KCl, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.35). The pipette solution was 130 mM CsCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EGTA, and 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.35); also present in the pipette was 1 mM ATP-Mg2+ (pH 7.4).
Pipettes were prepared from borosilicate glass and pulled by a two stage Narashige puller to give 1-1.5 MΩ resistance. Data were acquired with Axopatch CV-4 headstage with Digidata 1200 digitizer and Axopatch 1D amplifier. Data were analyzed using pClamp 6.04 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), Lotus 123 (IBM) and Origin (Microcal) software.
Compound 1 and compound 2 were used at a final concentration of 1 µM in 1% DMSO.
(Result)
As shown in Table 1, there was no affection of 1% DMSO on the control currents. Cl currents in HEK cells transfected with hClC-2 (Control) were activated by 1 µM compound 1 and 1 µM compound 2. Compound 1 and compound 2 did not increase Cl currents in non-transfected cells.
These studies demonstrate that compound 1 and compound 2 are ClC-2 channel openers.

Test Example 2
(Method)
16HBE14o- cells, a Human airway cell line derived from a healthy individual, which contain ClC-2 and the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator, Cl channel (CFTR); and CFBE41o- cells, a Human airway cell line derived from cystic fibrosis patients, which contain functional form of ClC-2 and defective form of CFTR (ΔF508 CFTR) were used. Both cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone), 20 mM 1-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin in flasks coated with fibronectin/collagen/BSA. When desired, the cells were plated on 0.3 cm2 collagen-coated permeable filters (Biocoat). After 24 hrs, the apical medium was removed so that the cells were grown in air-water interface. While they were grown in air-water interface, the basolateral side of the cells was fed with the medium and the medium was changed every other day. The cells were allowed to grow to confluence.
Short-circuit current measurements were used to evaluate Cl transport in polarized, confluent cultures of the cells grown in air-water interface. A plexiglass chamber for short-circuit current measurements in confluent cell monolayers grown on the 0.3 cm2 permeable support filters was used (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). Electrical measurements were made with a 7402C voltage clamp device (Bioengineering Department, Iowa University). The temperature was held constant at 37°C by circulating heated water through the water jacket of the chamber. The output of the amplifier was plotted on an analog chart recorder. Changes in short-circuit current (Δlsc) after addition of test compounds were normalized to filter area (0.3 cm2) and reported as ΔIsc/cm2.
Short-circuit current measurements in the 16HBE14o- and CFBE41o- cells were carried out as described by Lofling et al. (Am J Physiol, 277 (4 Pt 1):L700-8, 1999, the cited reference is herein incorporated by reference). The basolateral membrane solution contained 116 mM NaCl, 24 mM HCO3, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 3.6 mM sodium HEPES, 4.4 mM hydrogen HEPES (pH 7.4) and 10 mM glucose; the apical membrane bath solution was identical to the basolateral membrane solution, with the exceptions that the Cl- concentration was reduced by substitution of NaCl with Na gluconate and CaCl2 was increased from 0.5 mM to 2 mM to account for chelation of Ca2+ by the gluconate. Both solutions were bubbled with CO2/O2 (5%/95%), which also served to help mix the solutions. In all cases, the basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 200 µg/ml nystatin.
Compound 1 and compound 2 were used at a final concentration of 1 µM. The final concentration of DMSO was 1%.
(Result)
As shown in Table 2, 1 µM compound 1 increased short-circuit current in the 16HBE14o- cells. The extent of activation by compound 1 was 9.56 ± 0.095 µA/cm2. Compound 2 also increased short-circuit current by 11.6 ± 1.3 µA/cm2 in 16HEB14o- cells. There was a large negative effect of 1% DMSO of approximately -10.5 ± 2.0 µA/cm2. Despite this large decrease in short-circuit current by DMSO, the net effect of compound 1 and compound 2 were positive in these cells.
As shown in Table 2, 1 µM compound 1 increased short-circuit current in CFBE41o- cells by 5.0 ± 0.04 µA/cm2.1% DMS0 decreased short-circuit current by -5.7 ± 1.8 µA/cm2. Despite the large negative effect of DMSO, compound 1 caused a net positive increase in Cl currents in CFBE cells.
The results show that compound 1 and compound 2 are both openers of Cl channels in 16HBE14o- cells and compound 1 is an opener of hClC-2 in CFBE41o- cells.

(Method)
AS-HBE is a human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cell line expressing the first 131 nucleotides of CFTR in the antisense direction (antisense CFTR 16HBE14o- cells, HBE-AS; also called AS-HBE). As a result, AS-HBE cells lack CFTR transcripts and lack functional CFTR. However, AS-HBE cells do express functional ClC-2 in a manner identical to the parental cell line, 16HBE14o- cells, from which they were derived. AS-HBE cells were maintained at 37°C in 5%/95% CO2/O2 in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM; GIBCO/Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with Earl's salt, L-glutamine (GIBCO/Invitrogen), 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin sulfate and 400 µg/ml G-418 (GIBCO/Invitrogen). The cells were grown in air-liquid interface on Biocoat inserts (Fisher Scientific, Chicago, IL), coated with human plasma fibronectine (GIBCO/Invitrogen) and vitrogen (Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
According to the same manner as described in Example 2, Short-circuit current measurements in the AS-HBE cells were carried out. Changes in short-circuit current (AIsc) were normalized to the filter area (0.3 cm2) and reported as ΔIsc/cm2.
Test compounds were used at a final concentration of 250 nM.
(Results)
Table 3 shows effects of test compounds on short-circuit currents in AS-HBE cells. The results show that compounds of this invention are effective ClC-2 channel openers.

Test Example 5
(Method)
T84 cells, a human intestinal cell line, derived form confluent monolayers with tight junctions were used. Said cell line has been widely used in studies of Cl- transport using short-circuit current (Isc). These cells contain both CFTR and ClC-2.
T84 human intestinal epithelial cells were grown to confluence at pH 7.4 in 162-cm2 flasks (Corning Costar, MA) with a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 6% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 15 mM HEPES, 14.3 mM NaHCO3, and antibiotics/antimycotic. Flasks were passaged weekly and fed every 3 days. Cell monolayers for experiments were grown to confluence on collagen-coated permeable support (Biocoat). Monolayers were fed every 3 days and used after stable transepithelia resistance was achieved, c.a. 7-14 days post-plating.
According to the same manner as described in Example 2, Short-circuit current measurements in T84 cells were carried out. Changes in short-circuit current (ΔIsc) were normalized to filter area (0.3 cm2) and reported as ΔIsc/cm2.
Compound 1 was used at a final concentration of 50 nM.

Test Example 6
(Method)
Compound 1 (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16- difluoro-prostaglandin E1) of 1, 10 or 100µg/kg in the volume of 5mL/kg was orally administered to male Wistar rats (six weeks old, weight:180-210g) that had been fasted for at least 16 hours. The control group received the same volume of vehicle (distilled water containing 0.5% ethanol and 0.01% polysorbate 80). Thirty minutes after the administration, the animals were subjected to laparotomy under ether anesthesia. The top portion of the duodenum and the end portion of the ileum were ligated respectively, and the bowel was extirpated. The intestinal fluid of each animal was collected and centrifuged by 10,000 × g for 5 minutes. Supernatant was collected, and the concentration of chloride ion in the supernatant of intestinal fluid was measured with a chloride counter (CL-7, Hiranuma Sangyo Co.,Ltd.). Dunnett's test was used in the comparison of the control group and the groups receiving Compound 1 in each dose. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
(Result)
Table 6 shows the concentration of chloride ion in the intestinal fluid of each group. Administration of Compound 1 of 1, 10 and 100µg/kg increased the concentration of chloride ions in the bowel in a dose-dependant manner. Compared with the control group, the group receiving Compound 1 of 1µg/kg showed significant increase in the concentration of chloride ions in the intestinal fluid.
The above result indicates that Compound 1 opens chloride channels in the bowel to promote positively the chloride ion transport.

Compound 2 (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16- difluoro-18 (S)-methyl-prostaglandin E1) of 100µg/kg was orally administered to male Wistar rats (six weeks old, weight:180-210g) three times a day for seven days. The control group (n=7) received the same volume of vehicle (distilled water containing 0.01% polysorbate 80 and 0.5% ethanol). In the following morning of the final administration day (about 17 hours after the final administration), a polyethylene catheter (PE10, Becton Dickinson and Company) was inserted in the rats' choledoch under ether anesthesia. The rats were placed into Borrmann's cages and were left for 1 hour to awake from anesthesia. Bile discharged in one hour, from one to two hours after the insertion of the catheter, was collected and the concentration of chloride ion in the bile was measured with a chloride counter (CL-7, Hiranuma Sangyo Co., Ltd.). Student's t-test was used in the comparison of the control group and the group receiving Compound 2. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
(Result)
Table 7 shows the concentration of chloride ions in the bile of each group. Compared with the control group, the concentration of chloride ions in the bile of the group receiving Compound 2 increased significantly.
The above result indicates that Compound 2 opens chloride channels in the liver to promote positively the chloride ion transport.

Test Example 8
(Method)
Physiological saline, eye drops vehicle, or eye drops containing 0.0001% or 0.001% of Compound 1 was instilled to male white rabbits in the volume of 30µL/eye. Before the instillation (0 hour) and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 hours after the instillation, lacrimal fluid 5µL was collected from the conjunctival sac of palpebra inferior with a capillary pipette. The collected lacrimal fluid was diluted five fold with distilled water, and the concentration of chloride ions was measured with a chloride counter (CL-7, Hiranuma Sangyo Co.Ltd.). Student's t-test and Wilcoxon's test were used in the comparison of the control group and the groups receiving Compound 1 in each dose. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
(Result)
Table 8 shows the concentration of chloride ions in the lacrimal fluid of each group. Compared with the control group, Compound 1 increased the concentration of chloride ions in the lacrimal fluid in a dose-dependant manner. Compared with the control group, the group receiving 0.0001% eye drops of Compound 1 and the group receiving 0.001% eye drops of Compound 1 showed significant increase in the concentration of chloride ions in the lacrimal fluid at 4 and 8 hours after the instillation and 2, 4 and 8 hours after the instillation, respectively.
The above result indicates that test Compound 1 opens chloride channels in the eye by instillation to promote positively the chloride ion transport.
