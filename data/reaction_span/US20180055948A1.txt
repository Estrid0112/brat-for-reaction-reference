BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), a rapidly growing class of targeted therapeutics, represent a promising new approach toward improving both the selectivity and the cytotoxic activity of cancer drugs. An example of ADC drug having been approved for therapeutic use in the U.S. is brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS®), a chimeric anti-CD30 antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E used in treating anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Hodgkin lymphoma.
One conventional method employed in the design of antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) involves the coupling of drug molecules to thiol groups of antibody chains via a linking moiety. Free thiol groups are obtained as a result of breaking the cysteine interchain disulfide bonds of an antibody via a reduction reaction. A typical antibody contains 4 interchain disulfide bonds (2 between the heavy chains and 2 between the heavy and light chains). These interchain disulfides can be selectively reduced with dithiothreitol, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, or other mild reducing agents, to result in 8 reactive sulfhydryl groups for conjugation. This method can link up to eight drug molecules to a given antibody.
Due to the fact that at least two disulfide bonds are broken, ADCs designed using this principle are unstable once entered into circulation, and thus the half life of ADCs will be shortened. As a result, recent development in ADC design and synthesis adopts a different approach, namely, one that relies on covalently connecting two thiol groups by a coupling agent, thereby establishing thiol bridges between the two heavy chains and between the heavy and the light chains of a given antibody. Current research efforts exploring such an approach mainly focus on designing the structure of a coupling agent that not only has the functionalities to bridge two thiol groups covalently, but also encompasses the necessary components to facilitate specific biological activities.
Earlier studies in the field have utilized bis-maleimides to react with the two thiol groups resulted from a broken disulfide bond. The covalent coupling between maleimides and thiols is a classic alkene conversion reaction. More recently studied thiol-bridging reactions are also based upon this principle, with exemplary reactions involving maleimides, bis-maleimides, and maleimides with halogen substituents. To date, however, thiol-bridging linker compositions are limited to maleimides-based compounds only, and oftentimes not specified for applications in tumor-targeting ADCs. For example, previously disclosed methods of covalent thiol-coupling involving the use of similar maleimides-based compounds did not specify their applications in coupling with active agents such as tumor-targeting drug molecules, proteins, or polypeptides (see, for example, PCT Patent Application Publication No. WO 2013132268). Other methods that specifically disclosed applications in tumor-targeting ADCs utilizing maleimides-based compounds did not employ the covalent thiol-bridging mechanism in which one linker simultaneously reacts with two thiol groups, as provided by the present invention (see, for example, Chinese Patent Application Publication No. CN 103933575).

The term “active agent” as used according to the present invention includes any natural or synthetic substance that has a physiological effect when administered to an animal. The active agent can be utilized in accordance with the invention to treat, for example, warm blooded animals, particularly mammals including humans, veterinarian animals and farm animals. The active agent may act on, or be visualized at, a desired target within, or on, the animal body, including tumor tissue.
Non-limiting examples of “active agents” are drugs acting at synaptic sites and neuroeffector junctional sites; general and local analgesics; hypnotics and sedatives; drugs for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia; anti-epileptics and anticonvulsants; drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, aging and Alzheimer's disease; excitatory amino acid antagonists, neurotrophic factors and neuroregenerative agents; trophic factors; drugs aimed at the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) trauma or stroke; drugs for the treatment of addiction and drug abuse; drugs for the treatment of bacterial, viral and/or microbial infections, such as influenza, HIV, herpes, chicken pox, and the like; antacoids and anti-inflammatory drugs; chemotherapeutic agents for parasitic infections and diseases caused by microbes; immunosuppressive agents; anti-cancer drugs; hormones and hormone antagonists; heavy metals and heavy metal antagonists; antagonists for non-metallic toxic agents; cytostatic agents; visualization agents and other diagnostic substances; immunoactive and immunoreactive agents; transmitters and their respective receptor agonists and receptor antagonists, their respective precursors and metabolites; transporter inhibitors; antibiotics; antispasmodics; antihistamines; antinauseants; relaxants; stimulants; sense and antisense oligonucleotides; cerebral dilators; psychotropics; antimanics; vascular dilators and constrictors; anti-hypertensives; drugs for migraine treatment; hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic agents; minerals and nutritional agents; anti-obesity drugs; anabolics; anti-asthmatics; and mixtures thereof.
An “antibody,” also known as an immunoglobulin, is a large Y-shaped protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign entities such as bacteria and viruses. An antibody has four polypeptide chains, two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains connected by cysteine disulfide bonds.
A “monoclonal antibody” is a monospecific antibody where all the antibody molecules are identical because they are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. Monoclonal antibodies can be prepared by fusing myeloma cells with the spleen cells from a mouse (or B-cells from a rabbit) that has been immunized with the desired antigen, then purifying the resulting hybridomas by such techniques as affinity purification. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies can be prepared in viruses or yeast cells rather than in mice, through technologies including repertoire cloning or phage display/yeast display, the cloning of immunoglobulin gene segments to create libraries of antibodies with slightly different amino acid sequences from which antibodies with desired specificities may be obtained. The resulting antibodies may be prepared on a large scale by fermentation.
“Chimeric” or “humanized” antibodies are antibodies containing a combination of the original (usually mouse) and human DNA sequences used in the recombinant process, such as those in which mouse DNA encoding the binding portion of a monoclonal antibody is merged with human antibody-producing DNA to yield a partially-mouse, partially-human monoclonal antibody. Full-humanized antibodies are produced using transgenic mice (engineered to produce human antibodies) or phage display libraries.
A “linker” is a moiety with two reactive termini, one for binding, or otherwise associating with, a biological moiety or a fragment thereof, such as an antibody (or fragment thereof), and the other for conjugation to an active agent such as a cytotoxin.
A “cytotoxin” is an entity that, when in the presence of a cell, such as a cancer cell, is toxic or induces key functional changes to that cell.

Example II Preparation of Antibody Drug Conjugates
General Conjugation Procedure
DTPA (1 mM) and 3.0-5.0 equiv. of TCEP (10 mM) were added to antibody (10 mg/mL) in a PCR tube, and mixer for 1 hour to reduce the disulfide bonds on the antibody. Various amounts of the linker-active agent conjugate were added to the reaction mixtures and shaken overnight using a vortex mixer. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. The resultant products were analyzed by gel electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) and HIC (Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography)-HPLC.
The antibody drug conjugate was analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE: samples mixed with buffer were loaded onto 8%-15% acrylamide gels, and gel photographs were taken with a UVP BioDoc-it imaging system.
The bands (>50 kDa) appeared in lanes 2 and 3, which suggest that thiol-bridge conjugation was effective (H, L). Bands at 75 kDa represent the part composed of a heavy and a light chain which were linked by one pair of bridged thiols (LH). Two heavy chains were linked by one or two pairs of bridged thiols, which formed the bands at 100 kDa (HH). Bands at 125 kDa represent the part in which only one bridge between a heavy and a light chain was not formed (LHH). Lastly, bands at 150 kDa revealed formation of fully bridged antibody (LHHL).
The antibody drug conjugate was analyzed by HIC-HPLC under conditions: HPLC Column: TSK-GEL Butyl-NPR column 4.6*35 mm; Buffer A: 75% sodium phosphate (20 mM, pH 7.0), 25% isopropanol (v/v); Buffer B: sodium phosphate (20 mM, pH 7.0), Ammonium sulfate (1.5 mM); flow rate: 1.0 mL/min.
In Vitro Evaluation of Antibody Drug Conjugates
On the first day, a tumor cell line of human ovarian cancer cell lines, such as OVCAR3, was plated at 5000 cells in 100 μl culture medium on a 96 well culture plate (Cellstar). The cells were incubated in a CO2 incubator with saturated water at 37° C. overnight. On the second day, two covalent thiol conjugated ADCs of MSL-31 and MSL-75, were serially diluted conjugates were added to the 96 well plate containing OVCAR3 cells, 100 μl per well. The initial conjugate was 100000 ng/ml and diluted to 0.001 ng/ml. OVCAR3 cells with added ADC were incubated at 37° C. for 72 hours. The viability of tumor cell treated covalent thiol conjugated ADC was then measured using a cell viability kit, Cell Counting Kit-8 (DOJINDO, CK04) according to the manufacturer protocol on a plate reader (BIO-RAD iMark SpectraMax L from Molecular device). The IC50 value, 50% inhibition of cell growth was calculated using a curve fitting software, Graphpad.
Example II-1 Preparation of MSL-C31
DTPA (1 mM) and 5.0 equiv. of TCEP (10 mM) were added to anti-MSL (10 mg/mL) in a PCR tube. The mixture was agitated with a vortex mixer for 1 hour to reduce the disulfide bonds on the antibody. 25% of DMSO was subsequently added to the reaction mixtures. Compound 31 (5.0 equiv., 10 mM) was added to the reaction mixtures and shaken overnight using a vortex mixer. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. After reaction was over, the mixture was loaded into the Millipore 4 mL centrifugal ultrafiltration tube, and washed three times with PBS, then collected the reaction mixtures. FIG. 2 shows that products (the right lane) of covalent conjugation of at least one pair of sulfhydryl group will migrate slower than those of heavy (H) or light chain (L) alone (shown in left lane). The covalent conjugation between the heavy and light chains produced the band of 75 kDa (HL); the covalent conjugation of two heavy chains produced the band of 100 kDa (HH). There are 3 peaks in the HIC-HPLC chromatogram, representing 3, 4, and 5 of DAR, respectively. The DAR of the resultant MSL-C31 was 3.60 based on the results of HIC-HPLC (FIG. 3). FIG. 2 shows the result of reduced SDS-PAGE for, a) naked antibody, b) MSL-C31, the product of the covalent thiol-conjugate.

Example II-2 Preparation of MSL-C75
DTPA (1 mM) and 5.0 equiv. of TCEP (10 mM) were added to anti-MSL (10 mg/mL) in a PCR tube. The mixture was agitated with a vortex mixer for 1 hour to reduce the disulfide bonds on the antibody. 25% of DMSO was subsequently added to the reaction mixtures. 5.0 equiv. of Compound 75 (5.0 equiv., 10 mM) was added to the reaction mixtures and shaken overnight using a vortex mixer. All reactions were carried out at room temperature. After reaction was over, the mixture was loaded into the Millipore 4 mL centrifugal ultrafiltration tube, and washed three times with PBS, then collected the reaction mixtures. The samples were subjected to analysis by electrophoresis. The results of reduced SDS-PAGE were presented at Figure-4. The left lane was naked antibody and right lane was covalent conjugate of MSL-C75. The DAR of the resultant MSL-C75 was 3.87 based on HIC-HPLC.

Stability Study of HER2-C78 CONJUGATE
To determine the degradation rates of ADCs of covalent thiol conjugation vs. regular thiol conjugation, three ADC samples prepared by above procedures for the ELISA were used for stability study. ELISA implementation plan as follow: Firstly, Her2-ECD (100 ng) were coated on each well of a 96-well plate; Secondly, human peripheral blood treated with Anti-Her2-Mc-VC-PAB-MMAE (of regular thiol conjugation), Anti-Her2-Di-Mc-VC-PAB-MMAE (bi-maleimide-thiol conjugation) and Anti-Her2-PY-QJ2-ADC (Her2-C78, of covalent-thiol conjugation of this invention) were incubated in the coated well to allow binding to Her-2 ECD. At last, the amount of anti-her2 ADCs bound to Her2-ECD antigen is measured by binding anti-human IgG conjugated with a streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase, which then catalyzes the conversion of the chromogenic substrate o-phenylenediamine (OPD) into a colored product. The results show that during 3 days of incubation with peripheral bloods, the degradation rate of ADC with the regular thiol conjugation was 26.7%, that of 2nd ADC with bi-maleimide-thiol conjugation was 18.9% and that of 3rd ADC of this invention was 5.1%. The degradation rate of ADC with the covalent linker of this invention is the lowest among the three ADCs as shown in Table 3 below.

Example III-Activity of the Antibody Drug Conjugates
The antibody drug conjugates of the subject invention can be used, in one embodiment, to specifically target tumor cells and bind to tumor-associated antigens on the surface of the tumor cells. The complex of ADC-antigen will enter the tumor cell via endocytosis and releases its payload after the endosome of the ADC-antigen complex fuses with lysosomes. The released payloads inhibit the key functions of a tumor cell and/or even kill the tumor cells. If the payloads releases on the cell surface or near the tumor cells, the tumor cell can also be killed via a by-stander manner.
Thus, the invention provides various protein-drug complexes that inhibit the growth of tumor cells and/or their differentiation. These compounds, armed with various kinds of active payloads, can be used to treat neoplasm, autoimmune disorders and inflammation, even the differentiations of a tumor or stem cell.
Example III-1-Activity Against Tumors
In one embodiment, or the subject invention, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) combine the unique targeting of mAbs with the cancer-killing ability of cytotoxic drugs and allow ADCs to be powerful tumor-killing agents. Furthermore, the use of covalent thiol-conjugation in accordance with the subject invention increases the stability of the ADCs, limiting the decomposition of the ADC in the blood circulation, thereby reducing its toxicity. This example provides data showing treatment of human cancer, using ADCs prepared as described above, in nude mice implanted human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231).
To determine biological function of various ADC with covalent or regular conjugates, anti-Her-2 mAb has been thiol-conjugated with regular conjugation or covalent thiol-conjugated with the same linker and cytotoxin. The nude mice were implanted with a human cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) and the ADCs (0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 mg/kg) were administered through intraperitoneal injection when the tumor volume reached about 100 cubic millimeters. The tumor volumes were monitored every 3 days and animals were sacrificed at the end of 21 days and the tumors were dissected and weighed.
Table-4 below provides a comparison of efficacy between regular ADC vs. covalent thiol-conjugation ADC administered into nude mice implanted with human breast cancer cells.
