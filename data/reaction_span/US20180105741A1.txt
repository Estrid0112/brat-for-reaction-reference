CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0134541 filed on Oct. 17, 2016 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to a condensed cyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that produce full-color images, and also have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, short response times, as well as excellent characteristics in terms of brightness, driving voltage, and response speed.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transit from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.
SUMMARY
One or more embodiments include a novel condensed cyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.

The condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be one of Compounds 1 to 411, but embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited thereto:
When the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 is used in, for example, an emission layer, two groups linked via a single bond are three-dimensionally separated to suppress non-luminous attenuation while maintaining an emission wavelength of each group. Therefore, when an organic light-emitting device includes the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 in an emission layer, it is effective in implementing deep blue fluorescent and phosphorescent light-emitting devices with improved efficiency.
A synthesis method for the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 would be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art by referring to the following examples.
At least one condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be used between a pair of electrodes constituting an organic light-emitting device. For example, the condensed cyclic compound may be included in a hole transport region. In one or more embodiments, the condensed cyclic compound may be included in an emission layer.
Therefore, an organic light-emitting device may include: a first electrode; a second electrode facing the first electrode; and an organic layer between the first electrode and the second electrode, the organic layer including an emission layer and at least one of the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1.
In one or more embodiments, the emission layer may include the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1.
The expression “(an organic layer) includes at least one condensed cyclic compound” used herein may include a case in which “(an organic layer) includes identical compounds represented by Formula 1” and a case in which “(an organic layer) includes two or more different condensed cyclic compounds represented by Formula 1.”
For example, the organic layer may include, as the condensed cyclic compound, only Compound 1. In this regard, Compound 1 may exist in a hole transport layer or an emission layer constituting the organic light-emitting device. In one or more embodiments, the organic layer may include, as the condensed cyclic compound, Compound 1 and Compound 2. In this regard, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may exist in an identical layer (for example, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may all exist in a hole transport layer), or different layers (for example, Compound 1 may exist in a hole transport layer and Compound 2 may exist in an emission layer).
The organic layer includes i) a hole transport region that is disposed between the first electrode (anode) and the emission layer and includes at least one selected from a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an emission auxiliary layer, and an electron blocking layer, and ii) an electron transport region that is disposed between the emission layer and the second electrode (cathode) and includes at least one selected from a buffer layer, a hole blocking layer, an electron control layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer.
In one or more embodiments, the hole transport region may include the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1. For example, the hole transport region of the organic light-emitting device may include the hole transport layer, wherein the hole transport layer includes the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1.
The organic light-emitting device may further include at least one selected from a first capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward the outside through the first electrode and a second capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward the outside through the second electrode, and the at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include at least one condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1.
For example, the organic light-emitting device may have i) a stack structure including a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, ii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, and a second electrode which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, or iii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, and at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include the condensed cyclic compound.
The term “organic layer” used herein refers to a single layer and/or a plurality of layers disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode of the organic light-emitting device. A material included in the “organic layer” is not limited to an organic material.

Example 1
As an ITO anode, a Corning 15 Ω/cm2 (1,200 Å) ITO glass substrate was cut to 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm, sonicated with isopropyl alcohol and pure water each for 5 minutes, and then cleaned by exposure to ultraviolet rays and ozone for 30 minutes. Then, the resultant ITO glass substrate was provided to a vacuum deposition apparatus.
m-TNATA was vacuum-deposited on the ITO anode to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 600 Å, and Compound 40 was deposited on the hole injection layer to form a hole transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, thereby forming a hole transport region. Then, 9,10-di-naphthalene-2-yl-anthracene(ADN) (host) and N,N,N',N'-tetraphenyl-pyrene-1,6-diamine (TPD) (dopant) were co-deposited on the hole transport region at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 200 Å.
Alq3 was deposited on the emission layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, LiF was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å, and Al was deposited on the electron injection layer to form a cathode having a thickness of 3,000 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
