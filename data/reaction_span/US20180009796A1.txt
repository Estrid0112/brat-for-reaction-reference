TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention is directed to isoquinoline derivative compounds. Specifically, the compounds act as monoacylglycerol acyltransferase type 2 (hereinafter also referred to as “MGAT2”), and can be useful in preventing, treating or acting as a remedial agent for hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus and obesity.
BACKGROUND
Obesity is a condition in which the background of lack of exercise, intake of excessive energy, ageing, etc., leads to energy imbalance in the body. The surplus energy is accumulated generally as neutral fat (triacylglycerol, TG) in adipose tissue, and body weight and fat mass are thus increased. In recent years, the concept of metabolic syndrome associated with obesity involving the accumulation of visceral fat, as an upstream risk factor including a plurality of risk factors of diabetes, lipidosis, hypertension, etc. has been established, and the diagnostic criteria and therapeutic guidelines for metabolic syndrome were formulated (Journal of Japan Society for the Study of Obesity, vol. 12, Extra Edition, 2006). Since metabolic syndrome results in an increase in the risks of arteriosclerosis, cardiovascular disorder and cerebrovascular disorder, treatment of obesity has been recognized to be important for preventing these diseases.
Although the need for treating obesity is recognized to be important, there are extremely-limited drug therapies for obesity that are currently available, and there is no drug that is sufficiently satisfactory in terms of drug efficacy or side effects. Thus, development of novel antiobestic drugs having more definite action and few side-effects is desired.
Not less than 90% of lipid present in food is TG. TG derived from food is decomposed into 2-monoacylglycerol (2-MG) and free fatty acid (FFA) by the cleavage of the ester linkages of aliphatic acids at the 1- and 3-positions by lipase in digestive juice, which is secreted from the pancreas and the stomach. The 2-MG and FFA as well as bile acid are micellized and absorbed into small intestinal epithelial cells. The absorbed 2-MG and FFA resynthesize TG in the small intestinal cells, and the resynthesized TG as lipoprotein referred to as chylomicron (CM) is released into the lymph and supplied to the whole body. The TG resynthesis in the small intestinal cells is through two pathways, 2-MG and α-glycerophosphoric acid pathways. Typically, 80% of TG is resynthesized in the 2-MG pathway and the remaining 20% in the 2-plycerophosphoric acid pathways. The TG generated in the 2-MG pathway is utilized for generation of CM in accelerated turnover, and the synthesized CM is secreted into the intestinal lymph and then into blood and is transferred into peripheral tissue (Journal of Clinical Therapeutics and Medicine, vol. 21, No. 2, p. 216, 2005).
Enzymes such as MGATs (acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferases) and DGATs (acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases) are involved specifically in synthesis of TG in a 2-MG pathway. MGATs catalyze a reaction of generation of diacylglycerol by binding between 2-MG generated by lipase and fatty acyl-CoA, whereas DGATs catalyze a reaction of generation of TG by binding between the diacylglycerol generated by the catalytic reaction of the MGATs and fatty acyl-CoA.
Although such MGATs have been suggested to be present in the liver or white adipose tissue (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 259, p. 8934, 1984), the cloning of MGAT1 gene, a member of the family of MGATs, has been achieved in recent years, where the gene was isolated, as molecules expressed highly in the kidney, stomach, and white fat and brown fat cells, from a mouse (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA., vol. 99, p. 8512, 2002). However, although the activity of MGATs was observed significantly in the small intestine, no MGAT1 was expressed in the small intestine, and different molecules belonging to the family of MGATs were thus believed to be present.
Afterward, MGAT2 was cloned through homology search based on the cDNA sequence of MGAT1 by Cao et al., to isolate full-length cDNA from a cDNA library from the mouse small intestine (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 278, p. 13611, 2003). In addition, MGAT3 has been reported to be present in human (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 278, p. 13611, 2003), whereas no MGAT3 has been reported in rodents. The mouse MGAT2 is a 38.6-kDa protein including 334 amino acids, has an N-terminal 40-amino acid signal peptide, includes at least one transmembrane domain, and is expressed strongly in a small intestinal epithelial cell (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 278, p. 13860, 2003). In addition, both human and mouse MGATs2 were reported to include 334 amino acids and have 81% homology in human and mouse amino acid sequences, through the cloning of the human and mouse MGATs2, by Yen et al. (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 278, p. 18532, 2003). The expression pattern of MGAT2 in the small intestine has been exhibited to be similar to that of the site of absorbed lipid (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 279, p. 18878, 2004). In addition, the expression or activity of MGAT2 in the small intestine has been indicated to increase in high-fat diet-induced obesity mice (J. Biol. Chem, vol. 279, p. 18878, 2004) and OLETF rats exhibiting obesity or hypertriglyceridemia (Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract, vol. 57, p. 75, 2002), suggesting that MGAT2 is important for absorbing lipid and is involved in obesity or hypertriglyceridemia.
From the results, an MGAT2 inhibitor is expected to be useful as an agent for treating or preventing obesity, or type 2 diabetes, lipidosis, hypertension, fatty liver, arterial sclerosis, cerebrovascular disorder, coronary artery disease, etc., associated with obesity, through suppressing absorption of lipid.

Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.
Some of the compounds described herein contain substituted cycloalkanes having cis- and trans-isomers, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both cos- and trans-geometric isomers.
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline Intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.
It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the compounds of the structural formulas described herein are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and also salts that are not pharmaceutically acceptable when they are used as precursors to the free compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in other synthetic manipulations.
Solvates, and in particular, the hydrates of the compounds of the structural formulas described herein are included in the present invention as well.
Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers, which have different points of attachment of hydrogen accompanied by one or more double bond shifts. For example, a ketone and its enol form are keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are encompassed with compounds of the present invention.
In the compounds of the formulas described herein, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of the formulas described herein. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within generic formula can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or Intermediates.

Reactions sensitive to moisture or air were performed under nitrogen using anhydrous solvents and reagents. The progress of reactions was determined by either analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) performed with E. Merck precoated TLC plates, silica gel 60F-254, layer thickness 0.25 mm or liquid chromatography-mass spectrum (LC-MS). Mass analysis was performed on a WATERS Micromass® ZQ™ with electrospray ionization in positive ion detection mode. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted on an AGILENT 1100 series HPLC on WATERS C18 XTERRA 3.5 μm 3.0×50 mm column with gradient 10:90-100 v/v CH3CN/H2O+v 0.05% TFA over 3.75 min then hold at 100 CH3CN+v 0.05% TFA for 1.75 min; flow rate 1.0 mL/min, UV wavelength 254 nm). Concentration of solutions was carried out on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography was performed using a BIOTAGE Flash Chromatography apparatus (Dyax Corp.) on silica gel (32-63 mM, 60 Å pore size) in pre-packed cartridges. 1H-NMR spectra were obtained on a 400 or 500 MHz VARIAN Spectrometer in CDCl3 or CD3OD or other solvents as indicated and chemical shifts are reported as 6 using the solvent peak as reference and coupling constants are reported in hertz (Hz).
In general, compounds of Formula I were synthesized according to Scheme 1 or 2. In Scheme 1, tetrahydroisoquinoline 1 (T was Br or I) was converted to sulfide 2 where the amine was protected to provide 4 (P=protecting group). Alternatively, protection of the amine to give 3 was followed by sulfide formation, which also gave 4. Sulfide 4 was oxidized to give sulfonyl chloride 5, which reacted with amine 6 to provide sulfonamide 7. Deprotection followed by either reductive amination with aldehyde 9 or SN2 type displacement with compound 10 (LG=leaving group) completed synthesis.

In Scheme 2, double SN2 type reaction between amine 11 and compound 12 where LG was a leaving group provided the cyclication product tetrahydroisoquinoline 13. Conversion of 13 to sulfide 14 and in turn to sulfonyl chloride 15 was followed by sulfonamide formation completed the synthesis of compounds of Formula I.
