BACKGROUND
The present invention relates to non-ionic low diffusing photo-acid generators (PAGs) for lithographic applications, and more specifically to PAGs comprising sulfonate esters of fluoroalkyl substituted alpha-hydroxy aryl ketones.
Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography is expected to succeed current 193 nm immersion lithography combined with multiple patterning enhancements as the next generation printing technique. EUV radiation, with a shorter wavelength of 13.5 nm, is expected to achieve sub-20 nm features in a single exposure process. However, more advances in efficient light sources, EUV masks, and resists are needed for EUV lithography to become a manufacturing process.
During the last few years, considerable effort has gone into the development of resists for EUV applications. However, the majority of the EUV resists have been modified from the resists developed for 193 nm and 248 nm applications.
The highest performing photoresists for 193 nm and 248 nm applications are all based on a chemical amplification mechanism. Chemically amplified photoresists utilize a catalytic mechanism to generate a relatively large number of chemical events (e.g., deprotection reactions in the case of positive tone photoresists, or crosslinking reactions in the case of negative tone photoresists). Application of a relatively low dose of radiation induces formation of the catalyst, often a strong acid, which then catalyzes the chemical events. The current positive resist compositions comprise aqueous base soluble functional groups that are sufficiently protected with acid-labile groups so that the resist initially will not dissolve in an aqueous base developer. During exposure to radiation, the photo-acid generator (PAG) present in the resist composition produces a strong acid, which then catalyzes the removal of the acid-labile groups upon heating exposed resist layer in a post-exposure bake (PEB). This process produces aqueous base soluble material in the exposed area, which then is selectively removed with a basic aqueous developer to produce the images.
One phenomenon that limits the resolution potential of the resists developed for 248 nm, 193 nm and E-beam applications is referred to as “image blur” (see, e.g., Hinsberg et al., Proc. SPIE, (2000), 3999, 148). Image blur is generally thought to result from two contributing factors: gradient-driven acid diffusion and reaction propagation, the result being a distortion in the developable image compared to the projected aerial image transferred onto the film. This becomes critical in EUV applications because of the need for small features with low line edge roughness (LER). Therefore, a need exists to control the gradient driven acid-diffusion in the resist films.
Most widely reported PAGs in the resist formulations are ionic in nature (triphenylsulfonium or iodonium sulfonates). Non-ionic PAGs have some advantages such as higher solubility in casting solvents and homogeneous distribution in the resist film. Previously, a few non-ionic PAGs having imide photo-labile groups have been reported (U.S. Pat. No. 8,329,377 B2 to Takemoto, et al.).
In the area of photo acid generators (PAGs), a limited number of PAGs having aryl ketone protecting groups have been reported. U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,456 to Ueda, et al., discloses PAGs with perfluoro alkyl sulfonic acids. WO02/082185/A1 (JP2004519520A) to Ferreira, et al., and JP2002236358A (JP4145017B2) to Kunihiko disclose PAGs with perfluoroalkyl and perfluoro ether substituted sulfonic acids. Similarly, aryl ketone triflate PAGs have been described by Storer, et al., Analytica Chimica Acta (2006), volume 558(1-2), pages 319-325. These previously reported aryl ketone PAGs produce volatile and highly diffusing sulfonic acids that can be unstable in resist formulations.
Therefore, a need exists for aryl ketone protected PAGs that have higher thermal and hydrolytic stability in resist formulations and produce less volatile, low diffusing sulfonic acids.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Photo-acid generating (PAG) compounds are disclosed that comprise an aryl ketone group having a perfluorinated alkyl substituent alpha to the ketone carbonyl. The PAGs show improved diffusion, thermal stability, and hydrolytic stability properties for lithographic applications compared to otherwise identical compounds in which the perfluorinated alkyl substituent is replaced with a corresponding non-fluorinated hydrocarbon group or hydrogen. A lithographic exposure of a resist layer containing the disclosed non-polymeric PAGs releases a sulfonic acid. The released acid can have a low diffusion rate when the exposed resist layer is heated in a post-exposure bake (PEB) at a temperature in a range of about 100° C. to 150° C. Also disclosed are resist compositions comprising the non-ionic PAG compounds and lithographic methods of forming resist patterns therefrom. Hereinafter, it should be understood that the PAGs are non-ionic prior to a lithographic exposure unless otherwise stated.
The PAGs are capable of forming an acid when exposed to radiation having a wavelength between 0 nm and 300 nm, including electron beam (E-beam) radiation, extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV) having a wavelength of about 4-124 nm, soft x-ray, x-ray, γ-ray, and/or deep ultraviolet radiation (DUV) having a wavelength of about 125-250 nm (e.g., ArF excimer laser at 193 nm and KrF excimer laser at 248 nm). The PAGs can be relatively insensitive to DUV compared to EUV. As a result, EUV exposures of resists layers comprising the PAGs can produce lithographic patterns having fewer defects associated with out of band (OOB) radiation. In an embodiment, the lithographic process utilizes an ultraviolet wavelength of 13.5 nm (EUV) to expose a resist film comprising a disclosed PAG compound.
The PAG compounds are generally thermally stable up to at least 130° C. by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). In an embodiment, the PAG compounds are thermally stable up to at least 140° C. by TGA.
The PAG compounds can be used singularly or in combination to form a resist composition. A resist composition can comprise a PAG compound as the sole photo-acid generating material.
The term “positive-tone development” means the exposed areas of the resist layer are selectively removed during development by a given developer. The exposed areas can become more soluble in a given developer (e.g., aqueous alkaline developer) by, for example, a non-crosslinking chemical reaction induced by the exposure that increases the polarity of the exposed areas, thereby increasing solubility of the exposed areas relative to non-exposed areas in a given polar developer.
The term “negative-tone development” means the non-exposed areas of the resist layer are selectively removed during development. In this instance, the exposed areas of the resist layer can become less soluble in a given developer compared to the non-exposed areas. For example, a crosslinking reaction or some other chemical change induced by the exposure can lower the solubility of the exposed areas relative to non-exposed areas in a given developer.
The term “positive-tone resist pattern” refers to the resist layer containing non-exposed resist that remains after positive-tone development. The examples further below illustrate formation of positive-tone resist patterns using the PAG compounds.
The term “negative-tone resist pattern” refers to the resist layer containing exposed resist that remains after negative tone development.
The PAG compounds can be used to form a positive-tone resist pattern or a negative tone resist pattern.

Non-limiting exemplary solvents for the above reactions include dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, diethyl ether, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, chlorobenzene, dimethylformamide and acetonitrile. The solvents can be used singularly or in combination.
Resist Formulation
The PAG compound is used in a resist formulation (composition) in the form of a solution mixed with other components. When the PAG compound is used with a resin, the resin can be a positive tone resin or a negative tone resin. Non-limiting exemplary resins include polymers, molecular glasses, organometallic complexes, oligomers, and the like.
The resist composition can include not only a solvent but also various additives commonly used for resist compositions such as, for example, an auxiliary resin, a quencher, a dissolution inhibitor, a plasticizer, a stabilizer, a coloring agent, a surfactant, a viscosity improver, a leveling agent, an antifoaming agent, a compatibilizer, a primer, and/or an antioxidant. In the case of the negative resist composition, other additives such as a crosslinking agent and/or a basic compound can further be added. The additives can be used in addition to the following materials.
Resin
The resin can contain an acid-labile group so as to perform a positive resist function, or a cross-linking functionality so as to perform a negative resist function.
Examples of resins for a positive resist composition are those comprising a repeat unit having a pendant carboxyl group or acidic hydroxyl group protected by an acid-labile group on a side chain thereof, and a main chain portion derived from a polymerization of a vinyl polymerizable group, such as a repeat unit formed by polymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, α-trifloromethylacrylic acid, a vinyl group, an allyl group, and/or norbornene group.
Examples of the resin for the negative resist composition are those comprising a repeat unit having a cross-linking functionality on a side chain thereof such as, for example, hydroxyl groups, carboxyl groups, oxiranes (epoxides), oxetanes, blocked isocyanates, and a main chain portion resulting from a polymerization of a vinyl polymerizable group, such as a repeat unit formed by polymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, α-trifloromethylacrylic acid, vinyl group, allyl group, and/or norbornene group. The cross-linking functionalities can be present singularly or in combination.
The resin generally has a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 1,000,000, preferably 2,000 to 500,000, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). If the number average molecular weight of the resin is less than 1,000, the resulting resist composition generally does not form a film with sufficient strength. If the number average molecular weight of the resin exceeds 1,000,000, the solubility of the resin in the solvent decreases, adversely affecting the uniformity of films formed with the resist composition. The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn, PDI) of the resin is preferably in the range of 1.01 to 3.00, most preferably 1.10 to 2.50.
Crosslinking Agents
Non-limiting exemplary cross-linking agents for a negative resist composition, include compounds formed by reacting an amino-containing compound (e.g., melamine, acetoguanamine, benzoguanamine, urea, ethylene urea, propylene urea, and glycoluril) with formaldehyde or a mixture of formaldehyde and lower alcohol, thereby substituting a hydrogen atom of the amino group with a hydroxymethyl group or a lower alkoxymethyl group. Herein, the cross-linking agents using melamine, urea, alkylene urea (e.g., ethylene urea, propylene urea, and the like) and glycoluril are hereinafter referred to as “melamine-based cross-linking agent”, “urea-based cross-linking agent”, “alkylene urea-based cross-linking agent” and “glycoluril-based cross-linking agent”, respectively. The cross-linking agent is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of melamine-based cross-linking agents, urea-based cross-linking agents, alkylene urea-based cross-linking agents and glycoluril-based cross-linking agents. Particularly preferred are glycoluril-based cross-linking agents.
Examples of the melamine-based cross-linking agents are hexamethoxymethylmelamine, hexaethoxymethylmelamine, hexapropoxymethylmelamine and hexabutoxymethylmelamine. Hexamethoxymethylmelamine is preferred.
Examples of the urea-based cross-linking agents are bismethoxymethylurea, bisethoxymethylurea, bispropoxymethylurea and bisbutoxymethylurea. Bismethoxymethylurea is preferred.
Examples of the alkylene urea-based cross-linking agents are: ethylene urea-based cross-linking agents such as mono- and/or di-hydroxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-methoxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-ethoxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-propoxymethylated ethylene urea and mono- and/or di-butoxymethylated ethylene urea; propylene urea-based cross-linking agents such as mono- and/or di-hydroxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-methoxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-ethoxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-propoxymethylated propylene urea and mono- and/or di-butoxymethylated propylene urea; 1,3-di(methoxymethyl)-4,5-dihydroxy-2-imidazolidinone; and 1,3-di(methoxymethyl)-4,5-dimethoxy-2-imidazolidinone.
Examples of the glycoluril-based cross-linking agents are mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-hydroxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-methoxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-ethoxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-propoxymethylated glycoluril and mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-butoxymethylated glycoluril.
The total amount of the cross-linking agent used is preferably 3 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably 3 to 25 parts by mass, most preferably 5 to 20 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the resin of the resist composition. If the total amount of the cross-linking agent is less than 3 parts by mass of the resin, the resist composition is generally not capable of sufficient cross-linking to form a desirable resist pattern. The resist composition can exhibit poor storage stability and/or deteriorate in sensitivity with time if the total amount of the cross-linking agent exceeds 30 parts by mass of the resin.
Basic Compounds
The basic compound is preferably contained as an optional component in the resist composition so as to function as a quencher or to obtain improvements in resist pattern shape and post exposure stability.
Exemplary basic compounds include primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, heterocyclic amines, nitrogen-containing compounds with hydroxyphenyl group, alcoholic nitrogen-containing compounds and amide derivatives. Other basic compounds include tetralkylammonium hydroxides (e.g., tetraoctylammonium hydroxide). Secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines, aromatic amines and heterocyclic amines are preferred. The amine N-H group can optionally be protected by a tert-butyloxycarbonyl group (t-BOC group).
The aliphatic amines can be in the form of alkylamines or alkylalcoholamines each obtained by replacing at least one hydrogen atom of ammonia (NH3) with a C1-C12 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group. Examples of the aliphatic amines are: monoalkylamines such as n-hexylamine, n-heptylamine, n-octylamine, n-nonylamine and n-decylamine; dialkylamines such as diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, di-n-heptylamine, di-n-octylamine and dicyclohexylamine; trialkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-hexylamine, tri-n-pentylamine, tri-n-heptylamine, tri-n-octylamine, tri-n-nonylamine, tri-n-decanylamine and tri-n-dodecylamine; and alkylalcoholamines such as diethanolamine, triethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, di-n-octanolamine and tri-n-octanolamine. Above all, alkylacoholamines and trialkylamines are preferred. More preferred are alkylalcoholamines. Among the alkylalcoholamines, triethanolamine and triisopropanolamine are particularly preferred.
Other examples of the basic compound are: aromatic or heterocyclic amines including aniline, aniline derivatives such as N-methylaniline, N-ethylaniline, N-propylaniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, 2-methylaniline, 3-methylaniline, 4-methylaniline, ethylaniline, propylaniline, trimethylaniline, 2-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline, 2,6-dinitroaniline, 3,5-dinitroaniline and N,N-dimethyltoluidine, heterocyclic amines such as 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, hexamethylenetetramine and 4,4-dimethylimidazoline, and hindered amines such as bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate; and alcoholic nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-hydroxypyridine, aminocresol, 2,4-quinolinediole, 3-indole methanol hydrate, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-ethyldiethanolamine, N,N-diethylethanolamine, triisopropanolamine, 2,2'-iminodiethanol, 2-aminoethanol, 3-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)morpholine, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyridine, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, 1-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]piperazine, and 2-phenyl benzimidazole. The basic compounds can be used singularly or in combination.
The amount of the basic compound used is generally 0.01 to 5 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the resin of the resist composition.
Acid Additives
In the case of the negative resist resin, an organic carboxylic acid, a phosphorus oxo acid, and/or a derivative thereof can be added as an optional component in order to prevent sensitivity deterioration caused by the addition of the basic compound and to obtain improvements in resist pattern shape and post exposure stability. This acid compound can be used singularly or in combination with the basic compound.
Exemplary organic carboxylic acid include malonic acid, citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid and salicylic acid.
Examples of phosphorus oxo acid and its derivatives are: phosphoric acids and ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphoric acid, di-n-butyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate; phosphonic acids and ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphonic acid, dimethyl phosphonate, di-n-butyl phosphonate, phenylphosphonic acid, diphenyl phosphonate and dibenzyl phosphonate; and phosphinic acids or ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphinic acid and phenylphosphinic acid. Phosphonic acid is particularly preferred.
Solvents
There is no particular limitation on the organic solvent as long as the PAG compound can be dissolved in the organic solvent. Non-limiting organic solvents include: ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isoamyl ketone and 2-heptanone; polyhydric alcohols and derivatives thereof, such as monomethyl ether, monoethyl ether, monopropyl ether, monobutyl ether or monophenyl ether of ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoacetate, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl etheracetate (PGMEA), dipropylene glycol or dipropylene glycol monoacetate; cyclic ethers such as dioxane; esters such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, methyl methoxypropionate and ethyl ethoxypropionate; aromatic solvents such as xylene and toluene; lactones such as gamma-butyrolactone; and fluorinated solvents such as fluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon, perfluoro compound and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol. There can also be used a high-boiling-point weak solvent such as turpentine-based petroleum naphtha solvent or paraffin solvent for improvement in ease of application. These solvents can be used singularly or in combination.
Surfactants
Non-limiting surfactants for the resist composition include one or more fluorine- and/or silicon-based surfactants (i.e., fluorine-based surfactant, silicon-based surfactants, and surfactant containing both of fluorine and silicon atoms).
A resist composition comprising a surfactant is generally effective for use with an exposure light source of 250 nm or less wavelength, notably 220 nm or less wavelength and for pattern formation with a narrower pattern line width. It is possible to attain good sensitivity and resolution and obtain good resist patterning with less adhesion/development failures.
Other Acid Generators
The PAG compounds can be used singularly or in combination. The amount of the PAG compound used, including any second acid generating material, is generally in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the resist composition. If the amount of the acid generator is less than 0.5 parts by mass, the resist composition is generally not effective in forming good resist patterns. Moreover, storage stability of the resist composition decreases. The PAG compound is generally used in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by mass, preferably 10 to 100 parts by mass, more preferably 30 to 100 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total acid generator content.
Additive Resins
The resin composition can include one or more auxiliary resins in addition to the resin. There is no particular limitation placed on the auxiliary resin as long as the auxiliary resin can be dissolved in the solvent used and has compatibility with the other components of the resist composition. The auxiliary resin can function as an in-situ top coat, a plasticizer, a stabilizer, as a viscosity improver, a leveling agent, an antifoaming agent, a compatibilizer, and/or a primer.
Pattern Formation Method
Pattern formation using the resist composition can be performed by well-known lithographic processes. The process generally involves coating, prebaking, exposing to high-energy radiation (typically E-Beam, deep ultraviolet (DUV, e.g., 248 nm, 193 nm), or extreme ultraviolet (EUV, e.g., 13.5 nm), post exposure baking (PEB), and developing with alkaline developer. These steps are described in more detail below.
The term “substrate” refers to all underlying layers of a structure on which the resist layer is disposed. The term “disposed” refers to a layer in contact with a surface of another layer. “Disposing” or “applying” refer to forming a layer to be in contact with a surface of another layer, without limitation as to the method employed unless otherwise stated, providing the desirable properties of the disposed or applied layer are not adversely affected (e.g., uniformity and thickness). The term “casting” refers to forming a layer of a material by disposing a solution of the material dissolved in a solvent on a surface of another layer, and removing the solvent.
The substrate can have one or more layers arranged in a stack. The substrate, and more particularly the surface of the substrate, can comprise inorganic or organic materials such as metals, carbon, or polymers. The terms “surface” or “underlying surface” refer to the substrate surface on which the resist layer is disposed. More particularly, the substrate and/or surface of the substrate can comprise an inorganic material and/or organometallic material such as, for example, Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, SiO2, SiN, SiON, SiOC, TiN, WSi, BPSG, SOG, Ge alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP, as well as other III-V or II-VI compound semiconductors. The inorganic material and/or organometallic material can be doped, undoped or contain both doped and undoped regions therein. The substrate can also comprise a layered semiconductor such as Si/SiGe, or a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI). In particular, the substrate can contain a Si-containing semiconductor material (i.e., a semiconductor material that includes Si) such as, for example, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and quartz. A more particular surface layer comprises Cr, CrO, CrON, MoSi, and the like.
In a multi-layered substrate, the layer directly below and in contact with the resist layer is the top-most layer of the substrate, also referred to as “the underlayer” to the resist layer. As non-limiting examples, the resist layer can be disposed on the surface of a silicon wafer or a metal foil, or more particularly on the surface of an anti-reflection layer (ARC) of a multi-layer substrate, where the ARC layer is the top-most layer of the substrate. In this example, the ARC layer is also the underlayer of the resist layer. In another example, the ARC layer has a polymer brush layer attached to the top surface. In this example, the polymer brush layer is also the underlayer of the resist layer.
It should be understood that in some cases (e.g., when forming dense, high resolution patterns) all of the resist layer can receive some dose of radiation exposure. “Non-exposed resist” refers to resist that has received an insufficient dose to switch the solubility of the resist in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed resist (including pre-exposed resist that has been treated with an optional bake and/or optional rinse). “Exposed resist” has received sufficient exposure to switch the solubility of the resist in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed resist.
“Polarity change” implies an altered chemical composition that affects relative solubility without crosslinking. The extent of the polarity change can be measured by comparing the solubility of the exposed resist and non-exposed resist in a given developer. “Inducing a polarity change” in the resist layer means subjecting the resist layer to a treatment involving exposure, a post-exposure bake (PEB) and/or an optional rinse that alters the chemical composition of the layer such that the treated resist has a different solubility compared to the pre-treated resist in a given developer (e.g., tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution in water).
In the following example, the resin is capable of chemical amplification by formation of acid groups. In this instance, a positive-tone lithographic pattern can be formed, as illustrated in the schematic layer diagrams of FIGS. 1A to 1E. A resist composition comprising at least the resin, PAG compound, base quencher, and a solvent is disposed on surface 12 of substrate 10 (FIG. 1A) using any suitable coating technique (e.g., spin casting) followed by removal of the solvent to form resist layer 22 of structure 20 (FIG. 1B). Resist layer 22 comprises the solid components of the resist composition.
Resist layer 22 can be treated with an optional post-application bake (PAB) and/or an optional solvent rinse under suitable conditions of time and temperature before pattern-wise exposure. The optional PAB treatment is typically performed at a temperature of 50° C. to 250° C. for a period of 1 second to 10 minutes, more specifically 90° C. to 130° C. for about 1 minute. The PAB can be used to dry the film of excess solvent, remove unwanted or excess organic ligand, and/or partially crosslink the resist layer. The thermally treated dry film typically will have a thickness of 0.01 micrometers to 10 micrometers, depending on the subsequent radiation source and the desired application.
Then, the resist film is exposed to high-energy radiation, such as deep ultraviolet (DUV) light, excimer laser, x-ray, or extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light through a mask having a desired pattern. Pattern-wise exposure of resist layer 22 to high energy radiation results in exposed resist layer 32 of structure 30 (FIG. 1C). An ultraviolet light exposure dose is preferably on the order of about 1 mJ/cm2 to about 200 mJ/cm2, more preferably about 10 mJ/cm2 to about 100 mJ/cm2. The exposure can be performed by conventional lithography or by liquid immersion lithography. The liquid immersion exposure device uses a medium such as water, a hydrocarbon liquid, and/or a fluorinated liquid between the mask and the resist film in the optical path, which causes less absorption of high energy radiation and enables more efficient fine processing in terms of numerical aperture and effective wavelength. In this case, a protective film that is insoluble in water can be applied beforehand to the resist film. Alternatively, a pattern can be written on the resist film directly with an electron beam (e-beam), in which case the exposure dose is generally in the range of about 1 μC/cm2 to about 400 μC/cm2.
Exposed resist layer 32 is composed of regions of exposed resist 34 and regions of non-exposed resist 36. Exposed resist layer 32 can be treated with an optional post-exposure bake (PEB) and/or an optional solvent rinse under suitable conditions of time and temperature before development. The optional PEB can be performed at a temperature of 50° C. to 150° C. for 1 second to 10 minutes, more specifically 80° C. to 140° C. for about 1 to 5 minutes.
The resist layer can be rinsed before or after the exposure, the PAB, and/or the PEB with a solvent (e.g., water, aqueous solutions, including water/alcohol mixtures, and organic solvents). Typically, a rinse is performed after the PAB. Rinses can be performed at or near room temperature (e.g., 10° C. to 50° C.) for a period of 1 second to 1 hour. The optional baking (PAB and/or PEB) treatments and/or optional rinsing treatments can enhance the solubility difference of the exposed resist compared to the non-exposed resist. A PAB and/or PEB can facilitate deprotection of acid sensitive protecting groups and/or elimination of reaction byproducts of the resist composition.
The exposed resist 34 and/or baked exposed resist 34 has greater solubility in an aqueous alkaline developer compared to non-exposed resist 36. Consequently, aqueous alkaline development of the exposed resist layer affords a positive-tone image by removing regions of exposed resist 34. Typically, the developer is 0.1 to 5 wt %, preferably 2 to 3 wt % aqueous solution of tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), and the development time is for 0.1 to 3 minutes, preferably 0.5 to 2 minutes. Development can be conducted by conventional techniques such as dip, puddle and spray techniques, resulting in layered structure 40 comprising patterned resist layer 42 (FIG. 1D). Patterned resist layer 42 is a topographical relief pattern comprising resist features 44 composed of non-exposed resist 36. Resist features 44 are disposed on surface 46 of substrate 10 and have top surface 48 and sidewall 50. Substrate surface 52 is in contact with air.
Optionally, the pre-developed resist layer and/or post-developed resist layer can be treated with water vapor and/or alcohol vapor either at room temperature or at elevated temperature on a time scale of 1 minute to 5 hours. Such a treatment after exposure and PEB can be conducted, for example, to promote deprotection of acid sensitive groups by acid-catalyzed hydrolysis (e.g., the deprotection of acetal-based protecting groups).
The topographical relief pattern of patterned resist layer 42 can be transferred to substrate 10 by known methods followed by removal of resist features 44 (e.g., oxygen ion etching), resulting in structure 60 (FIG. 1E). Structure 60 comprises a transferred topographical pattern 62 within substrate 10, whose features 66 comprise bottom surface 64, sidewall surface 68, and top surface 70 of substrate 10.
Developers
The aqueous alkaline developer for positive tone development can comprise any suitable base. Non-limiting exemplary bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and various tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as, for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH). The aqueous alkaline developer can comprise one or more bases. Preferably, the aqueous alkaline developer comprises a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, more preferably tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Preferably, the TMAH developer comprises 0.1 to 5 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) based on total weight of the developer solution in water.
The organic solvent developer for negative tone development can comprise any suitable organic solvent. Non-limiting exemplary organic solvents include ketone-based solvents, ester-based solvents, alcohol-based solvents, amide-based solvents, ether-based solvents, and hydrocarbon-based solvents. More specific organic solvent developers include methyl benzoate (MeB), ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), 2-heptanone (MAK), 4-methyl-2-pentanone (4M2P), n-butyl acetate (NBA), amyl acetate, propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA), anisole, acetophenone, and combinations thereof.
Post-Development Treatment
The patterned resist layer can also be given a post-development treatment, for example, to increase etch resistance. The post-development treatment can be photochemical, thermal, chemical, or a combination thereof. As an example, the patterned resist layer can be given a second exposure to a second radiation, thereby forming a treated patterned resist layer. The second exposure can be performed with a single wavelength of second radiation or a combination of suitable wavelengths (broad band) of second radiation, so long as the exposure is effective in inducing the desired response of the treated patterned resist layer. The second exposure treatment can be a flood exposure. The flood exposure can be a single conventional whole area exposure or a combination of conventional whole area exposures. The exposure treatment can also be a scanning exposure delivered by a digital writing device employing light emitting sources. The second exposure can be followed by a thermal treatment to chemically amplify the formation of chemical functional groups in the treated patterned resist layer. For example, the flood exposure can release an acid from previously unreacted photo-acid generator (PAG) that upon subsequent heating catalyzes the deprotection of additional acid-sensitive carboxylic acid esters, aromatic acetals/ketals, and/or carbonates, thereby increasing the concentration of carboxylic acid and phenol groups in the treated patterned resist layer. With sufficient polarity change, the treated patterned resist layer can be rendered insoluble in either a low polarity solvent (e.g., anisole) or a more polar organic solvent, while retaining solubility in aqueous alkaline developer and/or a second organic solvent, without crosslinking the resist.
A post-development thermal treatment can further tailor the solvent compatibility, chemical structure of the resist material, and/or etch resistance of the patterned resist layer. The thermal treatment can be conducted at a temperature of 50° C. to 600° C., 50° C. to 300° C., or 50° C. to 200° C. for a period of 1 sec to 1 day.
A chemical treatment can include, for example, contacting the patterned resist layer with the vapors of a volatile Lewis acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or a sulfonic acid. In each type of treatment, the chemical alteration of the resist is preferentially uniformly distributed throughout the treated resist, not just at the surface. The post-development chemical treatment can cause a chemical change in the revealed surface of the substrate, producing (after removal of the resist features) a chemically patterned surface of the substrate.
Other post development treatments can include infiltration by ALD (aka SIS process) or chemical infiltration methods to infiltrate inorganic components into the resist and improve its etch properties.
Etching includes any common etching technique applied in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, for example, dry-etching such as plasma etching, or wet-etching using selective solvents. Typically, dry etching processes are employed for etching at sub-50 nm dimensions.
To further illustrate a multi-layered substrate, structure 40 of FIG. 1D is reproduced as structure 70 of FIG. 2, with the exception that substrate 72 of FIG. 2 has two layers, a bottom layer 74 and an intermediate layer 76. Bottom layer 74 of substrate 72 can be, for example, a silicon wafer. Intermediate layer 76 can be, for example, an ARC layer. In this example, surface 78 is a surface of the ARC layer in contact with air, and resist features 44 are disposed on ARC surface 80.
The following examples demonstrate the preparation of the PAG compounds, resist compositions thereof, and resist patterns formed therefrom. The resist formulations were not optimized.

Examples 10-17 of Table 2 were relatively thermally stable whereas the comparative PAG compounds were not. For example, PAG-1 has a decomposition temperature of about 195° C. (FIG. 3, DSC), whereas the comparative PAGS had the following decomposition temperatures: CPAG-1 decomposed at 85° C. by TGA (FIG. 4), CPAG-2 decomposed at 115° C. by TGA (FIG. 5), CPAG-3 decomposed at 155° C. by TGA (FIG. 6A) and at 140° C. by DSC (FIG. 6B), CPAG-4 decomposed at 105° C. by DSC (FIG. 7, DSC), and CPAG-5 decomposed at 90° C. by DSC (FIG. 8, DSC). Despite the comparatively higher thermal stability of CPAG-3 relative to the other comparative PAG compounds, the positive resist formulation with this PAG was unstable. The inventive PAGs having the α-CF3 group exhibit increased hydrolytic stability and thermal stability relative to the comparative PAGs having only hydrogens at the alpha position to the carbonyl. Without being bound by theory, the improved hydrolytic stability may be due to the increase in steric hindrance reducing nucleophilic attack by water or other nucleophiles. The greater hydrolytic (and nucleophilic) stability affords greater stability in solution, in formulated photoresists, and/or in photoresist coatings by avoiding the deleterious production of acid by mechanisms other than exposure to radiation.
Polymer Synthesis
A standard acid-labile polymer, P(NBHFAMA-co-ECPMA) 60:40 m/m, was used as the base polymer in the formulations for the evaluation of the PAGs. End groups are not shown in the structure below.
<img> id-US20180046077A1-20180215-C00065.TIF </img>
Example 24 Preparation of Acid-Labile Polymer P-1
NBHFAMA (10.80 grams, 0.03 mole), ECPMA (3.64 grams, 0.02 mole), and 58 grams of tetrahydrofuran (THF) were placed in a round bottom flask equipped with a condenser and a nitrogen inlet. To this solution, 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (0.33 gram, 0.002 mole) and 1-dodecanethiol (0.30 gram, 0.0015 mole) were added and stirred until dissolved. Then, the solution was degassed using four vacuum/nitrogen purges. The solution was then heated at 70° C. in an oil bath for 18 hours. Afterwards, the solution was added drop-wise into hexanes (1.2 liter). The precipitated polymer was filtered through a medium frit funnel, washed with 100 mL hexanes, and dried under suction. The polymer was then dried in a vacuum oven at 60° C. Yield: 5.06 grams; Mw 11890; Mn 9355; polydispersity (PDI): 1.27; Tg: 150.8° C.
Resist Formulations
Resist compositions were prepared by forming a 3.5 wt % (weight %) solution, based on total weight of the solution, in propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PGMEA) containing 100 parts polymer P(NBHFAMA-co-ECPMA) 60:40, 4 to 5 parts of PAG, and 0.33 or 0.66 parts of an organic base, 2-phenyl benzimidazole (quencher 1). The solution was then filtered through 0.2 micrometer PTFE syringe filter. The formulations were not optimized.
Examples 10-17 were stable in the resist formulation. Comparative PAG CPAG-5 (Example 22) was not stable in resist formulation. For example, the resist formulation with CPAG-5 decomposed within one week, indicating that an alkyl or aryl group substituent at the alpha-position of the aryl ketone group makes the PAG less stable. In theory, substituent groups such as methyl at the alpha position to the carbonyl can stabilize the partial positive charge that is develops on the alpha carbon during thermal elimination of the sulfonate group. This facilitates the elimination reaction at lower temperatures. Similarly, CPAG-6 with two electron-donating methyl groups at the alpha-position is so unstable it cannot be isolated. This is in agreement with the general stability of carbocations (tertiary>secondary>primary). In contrast, the inventive PAGs (e.g., Examples 10-17) have an electron-withdrawing substituent in the alpha position which inductively destabilizes the formation of any partial positive charge on the alpha carbon, thereby disfavoring elimination and increasing the thermal stability of the PAG.
Line Patterns
The resist formulation was spin coated to a thickness between 30 to 50 nm onto silicon wafers having a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC). The BARC underlayer was used for adhesion purposes. The wafer was given a post-apply bake at 110° C. for 60 seconds on a hot plate. The wafer was then exposed on a 0.3-NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) micro exposure tool (MET) at variable doses. The exposed wafer was given a post-exposure bake at 110° C. for 60 seconds. Both bakes were done with the wafer in contact with the hot plate. A 60-second development of the resist was carried out using a gentle spray of 0.26 N aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution (TMAH) to puddle followed by water rinse and spin dry. Top and cross-sectional images were inspected using a LEO Carl Zeiss scanning electron micrograph (SEM) tool. Cross sectional samples were coated with thin PdAu to avoid sample charging.

The results indicate that PAGs comprising a perfluorinated hydrocarbon substituent on the sulfonate ester methylene exhibit improved thermal stability compared to an otherwise identical PAG compound comprising a non-substituted methylene group or a non-fluorinated hydrocarbon substituent. The results also indicate that PAGs comprising a perfluorinated hydrocarbon substituent on the sulfonate ester methylene exhibit improved hydrolytic/nucleophilic stability compared to an otherwise identical PAG compound comprising a non-substituted methylene group.
