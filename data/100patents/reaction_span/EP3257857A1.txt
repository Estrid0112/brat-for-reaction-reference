TECHNICAL FIELD
The present application relates to a novel amino six-membered saturated heteroalicyclic derivative with dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) long-acting inhibitory activity, a preparation process thereof, a pharmaceutical composition thereof, and a use in the treatment of diseases and disorders benefitting from DPP-IV inhibition.
BACKGROUND
Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) is a serine protease that can rapidly cleave a protein in which an amino acid at the N-terminus of a peptide chain is proline or alanine, is responsible for a metabolic cleavage of some endogenous peptides (such as GLP-1 and GIP) in vivo, and has shown to have a proteolytic activity against a variety of other peptides such as GHRH, NPY, GLP-2 and VIP in vitro. Because of the degradation of DPP-IV, GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated in vivo, thus inhibiting the activity of DPP-IV would greatly prolong physiological activity duration of GLP-1 and GIP in vivo, which indirectly regulate the insulin secretion and ultimately play a role in controlling a blood glucose level.
As a novel means for treating diabetes, DPP-IV inhibitors can glucose-dependently stimulate insulin secretion, is not prone to have hypoglycemic side effects upon controlling a blood glucose level, and also have some advantages, such as preserving islet β cell function, having few gastrointestinal tract side effects, good tolerance, and the like. DPP-IV inhibitors can be administered orally without the need for injection, and is comparable to existing oral hypoglycemic agents in therapeutic efficacy.
Based on the above features, DPP-IV inhibitors are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of DPP-IV mediated diseases and disorders, such as diabetes, obesity, and the like, particularly type II diabetes.
Currently, eight DPP-IV inhibitors have successfully marketed, which are sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin, anagliptin, gemigliptin, and teneligliptin; five DPP-IV inhibitors are in the Phase II/III clinical study; and more DPP-IV inhibitors are in Phase I clinical study and pre-clinical study phase.
Because diabetes is a chronic disease, and patients need lifelong medication, the convenience of medication has a direct impact on whether patients could adhere to treatment. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for novel DPP-IV inhibitors, particularly for long-acting DPP-IV inhibitors.

Biological Experimental Example 2: Measuring Pharmacokinetics Parameters
The pharmacokinetic parameters of compounds of the present application were determined by using the following method.
Healthy male adult rats (7-9 weeks old) were used in this study. Each group of animals (3 male rats) was intragastrically administered once at a single dose of 5 mg/kg. The animals in the intragastric administration group were fasted overnight before this study. The fasting time period was from 10 hours before administration to 4 hours after administration.
Blood samples were taken at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h after adminstration. The animals were anesthetized with isoflurane using an animal anesthesia machine, and then 0.3 mL whole blood samples were taken from the fundus venous plexus. The blood samples were placed in heparin anticoagulant tubes, and centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C and 4000 rpm. The resulting plasmas were transferred to centrifuge tubes, and stored at -80° C until analysis.
Verified LC-MS/MS method was used to analyze the plasma samples. Plasma concentration-time data of animals were analyzed using WinNonlin (Professional Edition, version 6.3; Pharsight Company) software. The non-compartmental model was introduced for concentration analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the compounds were calculated, and shown in Table 2 below.
