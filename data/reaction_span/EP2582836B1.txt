Background of the Invention
Revlimid® (lenalidomide) is an FDA-approved small molecule drug developed and marketed by Celgene for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) in combination with dexamethasone and for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with a specific 5q chromosomal deletion. The cellular target and mechanism of action of Revlimid® are unknown in the art. In 2009, sales of Revlimid® reached USD $ 1.7 billion and sales in 2010 are expected to exceed USD $2.0 billion, making Revlimid® one of the most successful oncology products introduced into commerce in the past five years. Based on this demonstrated commercial success and the absence of any FDA-approved competitive therapeutic drugs with a similar mechanism of action, the potential economic value of the demonstrated anti-cancer target(s) of Revlimid® (lenalidomide) is considerable.
Revlimid® belongs to a class of compounds referred to as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) that include the analogs thalidomide (FDA-approved for MM and leprosy) and pomalidomide (actimid™, under development by Celgene). Thomson Pharma has projected that annual Revlimid® drug sales could reach USD $3.8 billion by 2013. Because of thalidomide's well-known teratogenic effects, Revlimid® is sold under an FDA-mandated risk mitigation program with a 'Black Box Warning' describing the risks of birth defects. Recently, the protein target responsible for the teratogenicity of thalidomide was published as Cereblon (CRBN) (Ito et al, Science 327:1345-1350 (2010)); however, the anticancer target(s) of IMiD's are still unknown.
Miyoshi, A. et al., Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, 303 (2003) 309-405 discloses a PRPK/TPRKB complex having protein kinase acivity.
Summary of the Invention
The present invention encompasses the recognition that compounds such as lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide interact with a PRPK/TPRKB complex in order to affect their activities.

Biologically active: As used herein, the phrase "biologically active" refers to a characteristic of any substance that has activity in a biological system and/or organism. For instance, a substance that, when administered to an organism, has a biological effect on that organism, is considered to be biologically active. In particular embodiments, where a protein or polypeptide is biologically active, a portion of that protein or polypeptide that shares at least one biological activity of the protein or polypeptide is typically referred to as a "biologically active" portion.
Biological target: As used herein, the term "biological target" refers to any target that may be utilized in the systems, methods, assays, and/or compositions described herein. A "biological target" may refer to one or more of the following: (1) a PRPK protein, a nucleic acid encoding PRPK, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (2) a TPRKB protein, a nucleic acid encoding TPRKB, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (3) a OSGEP protein, a nucleic acid encoding OSGEP, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (4) a LAGE3 and its homologs protein, a nucleic acid encoding LAGE3 and its homologs, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; and/or (5) a complex of any two or more of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and/or LAGE3 and its homologs.
Characteristic portion: As used herein, the phrase a "characteristic portion" of a substance, in the broadest sense, is one that shares some degree of sequence and/or structural identity and/or at least one functional characteristic with the relevant intact substance. For example, a "characteristic portion" of a protein or polypeptide is one that contains a continuous stretch of amino acids, or a collection of continuous stretches of amino acids, that together are characteristic of a protein or polypeptide. In some embodiments, each such continuous stretch generally will contain at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 29, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50 or more amino acids. In general, a characteristic portion is one that, in addition to the sequence identity specified above, shares at least one functional characteristic with the relevant intact protein. In some embodiments, the characteristic portion may be biologically active and/or may confer biological activity onto a polypeptide in which it is included.
Control: As used herein, the term "control" has its art-understood meaning of being a standard against which results are compared. Typically, controls are used to augment integrity in experiments by isolating variables in order to make a conclusion about such variables. In some embodiments, a control is a reaction or assay that is performed simultaneously with a test reaction or assay to provide a comparator. In one experiment, the "test" (i.e., the variable being tested) is applied. In the second experiment, the "control," the variable being tested is not applied. In some embodiments, a control is a historical control (i.e., of a test or assay performed previously, or an amount or result that is previously known). In some embodiments, a control is or comprises a printed or otherwise saved record. A control may be a positive control or a negative control.
Core structure element: As used herein, the term "core structure element" refers to a feature or collection of features of a molecule that represents specific characteristics responsible for biological activity or lack thereof. For example, test agents that contain an isoindolinone moiety can be said to share a core structure element. A core structure element may be, e.g., a ring system, or a core structure element may be, e.g., a linear structure that is similar in length and atom identity.
Engineered: In general, the term "engineered" refers to the aspect of having been manipulated by the hand of man. For example, a polynucleotide is considered to be "engineered" when two or more sequences, that are not linked together in that order in nature, are manipulated by the hand of man to be directly linked to one another in the engineered polynucleotide. For example, an engineered polynucleotide comprises a regulatory sequence that is found in nature in operative association with a first coding sequence but not in operative association with a second coding sequence, is linked by the hand of man so that it is operatively associated with the second coding sequence.
Expression: As used herein, "expression" of a nucleic acid sequence refers to one or more of the following events: (1) production of an RNA template from a DNA sequence (e.g., by transcription); (2) processing of an RNA transcript (e.g., by splicing, editing, and/or 3' end formation); (3) translation of an RNA into a polypeptide or protein; (4) post-translational modification of a polypeptide or protein.
Heterologous: The term "heterologous", as used herein to refer to nucleic acids (e.g., nucleic acids including regulatory sequences and/or genes) or polypeptides, refers to a nucleic acid or polypeptide that is artificially introduced into a cell and/or does not naturally occur in the cell in which it is present. In some embodiments, a heterologous nucleic acid has a nucleotide sequence that is identical to that of a nucleic acid naturally present in the cell. In many embodiments a heterologous nucleic acid has a nucleotide sequence that is different from that of any nucleic acid that is naturally present in the cell. In some embodiments, a nucleic acid that is heterologous to a particular cell has a nucleic acid sequence that is identical to that of a nucleic acid that is naturally found in a source organism that is different from the cell into which the heterologous nucleic acid is introduced.
Host cell: As used herein, the "host cell" is a cell that is manipulated according to the present disclosure. A "modified host cell", as used herein, is any host cell which has been modified, engineered, or manipulated in accordance with the present disclosure as compared with an otherwise identical parental cell, and/or as compared with a particular reference cell (e.g., a wild type cell).
Introduce: The term "introduce", as used herein with reference to introduction of a nucleic acid into a cell or organism is intended to have its broadest meaning and to encompass introduction, for example by transformation methods (e.g., calcium-chloride-mediated transformation, electroporation, particle bombardment), and also introduction by other methods including transduction, conjugation, and mating. In some embodiments, a vector is utilized to introduce a nucleic acid into a cell or organism.
In vitro: As used herein, the term "in vitro" refers to events that occur in an artificial environment, e.g., in a test tube or reaction vessel, in cell culture, etc., rather than within a multi-cellular organism.
In vivo: As used herein, the term "in vivo" refers to events that occur within a multi-cellular organism such as a non-human animal.
Isolated: As used herein, the term "isolated" refers to a substance and/or entity that has been (1) separated from at least some of the components with which it was associated when initially produced (whether in nature and/or in an experimental setting), and/or (2) produced, prepared, and/or manufactured by the hand of man. Isolated substances and/or entities may be separated from at least about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, about 98%, about 99%, substantially 100%, or 100% of the other components with which they were initially associated. In some embodiments, isolated agents are more than about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 91%, about 92%, about 93%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, substantially 100%, or 100% pure. As used herein, a substance is "pure" if it is substantially free of other components. As used herein, the term "isolated cell" refers to a cell not contained in a multi-cellular organism.
Modified: The term "modified" may be used herein to refer to an entity (e.g., a cell or organism) that has been manipulated by the hand of man. For example, in some embodiments, a modification may be or comprise any chemical, physiological, genetic, or other modification that appropriately alters characteristics of a host organism as compared with an otherwise identical reference organism not subjected to the modification. In most embodiments, a modification will comprise a genetic modification. In some embodiments, a modification comprises at least one chemical, physiological, genetic, or other modification; in some embodiments, a modification comprises more than one chemical, physiological, genetic, or other modification. In certain aspects where more than one modification is utilized, such modifications can comprise any combination of chemical, physiological, genetic, or other modification (e.g., one or more genetic, chemical and/or physiological modification(s)).
Modulator: As used herein, the term "modulator" typically refers to a compound that alters or elicits an activity. For example, the presence of a modulator may result in an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity compared to the magnitude of the activity in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor or antagonist, which decreases the magnitude of one or more activities. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor completely prevents one or more biological activities. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an activator or agonist, which increases the magnitude of at least one activity. In certain embodiments the presence of a modulator results in an activity that does not occur in the absence of the modulator. As used herein, the terms "inhibiting," "reducing," "preventing," or "antagonizing," or any variations of these terms as used herein, refer to a measurable decrease of a biological activity. In some embodiments, the decrease is a 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% reduction in the biological activity relative to a control. As used herein, the terms "stimulating," "increasing," or "agonizing," or any variations of these terms as used herein, refer to a measurable increase of a biological activity. In some embodiments, the increase is a 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, or 99% increase in the biological activity relative to a control. A modulator can also be a "silent modulator", wherein the modulator interacts with (e.g., binds to) the target of interest but does not elicit or alter an activity of the target.
Natural product: As used herein, the term "natural product" refers to a chemical compound or substance that is or can be produced by a living organism. In some embodiments, a natural product is not a biopolymer such as a polynucleotide, peptide or polypeptide, or oligosacharride. A compounds that is structurally identical to a natural product can be referred to as a "natural product" even if the compound itself is in fact prepared by the hand of man (e.g., by chemical synthesis).
Nucleic acid: As used herein, the term "nucleic acid," in its broadest sense, refers to any compound and/or substance that can be incorporated into an oligonucleotide chain. In some embodiments, "nucleic acid" encompasses RNA as well as single and/or double-stranded DNA and/or cDNA. Furthermore, the terms "nucleic acid," "DNA," "RNA," and/or similar terms include nucleic acid analogs, i.e. analogs having other than a phosphodiester backbone. For example, the so-called "peptide nucleic acids," which are known in the art and have peptide bonds instead of phosphodiester bonds in the backbone, are considered within the scope of the present invention. The term "nucleotide sequence encoding an amino acid sequence" includes all nucleotide sequences that are degenerate versions of each other and/or encode the same amino acid sequence. Nucleotide sequences that encode proteins and/or RNA may include introns.
Peptide: As used herein, the term "peptide" or "polypeptide" refers to a macromolecule which comprises a multiplicity of amino or imino acids (or their equivalents) in peptide linkage. In the polypeptide or peptide notation used herein, the lefthand direction is the amino-terminal direction and the right-hand direction is the carboxy-terminal direction, in accordance with standard usage and convention. Peptides may include moieties other than amino acids (e.g., may be glycoproteins, proteoglycans, etc.) and/or may be otherwise processed or modified. Peptides may contain L-amino acids, D-amino acids, or both and may contain any of a variety of amino acid modifications or analogs known in the art. Useful modifications include, e.g., terminal acetylation, amidation, etc. In some embodiments, peptides may comprise natural amino acids, non-natural amino acids, synthetic amino acids, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, peptides may contain up to 25 amino acids. As used herein, peptides containing up to 25 amino acids are also referred to as short peptides. The term "peptide" or "polypeptide" is also used to refer to specific functional classes of polypeptides, such as, for example, desaturases, elongases, etc. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the term "polypeptide" is intended to be sufficiently general as to encompass not only polypeptides having the complete sequence recited herein (or in a reference or database specifically mentioned herein), but also to encompass polypeptides that represent functional fragments (i.e., fragments retaining at least one activity) of such complete polypeptides. Moreover, those of ordinary skill in the art understand that protein sequences generally tolerate some substitution without destroying activity. Thus, any polypeptide that retains activity and shares at least about 30-40% overall sequence identity, often greater than about 50%, 60%, 70%, or 80%, and further usually including at least one region of much higher identity, often greater than 90% or even 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% in one or more highly conserved regions, usually encompassing at least 3-4 and often up to 20 or more amino acids, with another polypeptide of the same class, is encompassed within the relevant term "polypeptide" as used herein. Other regions of similarity and/or identity can be determined by those of ordinary skill in the art by analysis of the sequences of various polypeptides described herein. As is known by those of ordinary skill in the art, a variety of strategies are known, and tools are available, for performing comparisons of amino acid or nucleotide sequences in order to assess degrees of identity and/or similarity. These strategies include, for example, manual alignment, computer assisted sequence alignment and combinations thereof. A number of algorithms (which are generally computer implemented) for performing sequence alignment are widely available, or can be produced by one of skill in the art. Representative algorithms include, e.g., the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., 1981, 2: 482); the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (J. Mol. Biol., 1970, 48: 443); the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA), 1988, 85: 2444); and/or by computerized implementations of these algorithms (e.g., GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.). Readily available computer programs incorporating such algorithms include, for example, BLASTN, BLASTP, Gapped BLAST, PILEUP, CLUSTALW, etc. When utilizing BLAST and Gapped BLAST programs, default parameters of the respective programs may be used. Alternatively, the practitioner may use non-default parameters depending on his or her experimental and/or other requirements (see for example, ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Pure: As used herein, a substance and/or entity is "pure" if it is substantially free of other components. For example, a preparation that contains more than about 90% of a particular substance and/or entity is typically considered to be a pure preparation. In some embodiments, a substance and/or entity is at least 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% pure.
Reference agent: The term "reference agent," as used herein, refers to a substance (e.g., a chemical compound, small molecule, natural product, protein, peptide, nucleic acid) that has a known activity in a particular assay. A reference agent may also be referred to as a "standard." A reference agent may be a positive standard, showing positive activity in a particular assay, or may be a negative standard, known to be inactive in a particular assay. A reference agent may be contemporaneous to an agent of interest or may be a historical standard. In certain embodiments, a test agent and a reference agent are evaluated under comparable assay conditions.
Small molecule: In general, a "small molecule" is understood in the art to be an organic molecule that is less than about 5 kilodaltons (Kd) in size. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 4 Kd, about 3 Kd, about 2 Kd, or about 1 Kd. In some embodiments, the small molecule is less than about 800 daltons (D), about 600 D, about 500 D, about 400 D, about 300 D, about 200 D, or about 100 D. In some embodiments, a small molecule is less than about 2000 g/mol, less than about 1500 g/mol, less than about 1000 g/mol, less than about 800 g/mol, or less than about 500 g/mol. In some embodiments, small molecules are non-polymeric. In some embodiments, small molecules are not proteins, peptides, or amino acids. In some embodiments, small molecules are not nucleic acids or nucleotides. In some embodiments, small molecules are not saccharides or polysaccharides.
Source organism: A "source organism", as that term is used herein, is an organism that naturally contains or produces a polynucleotide, polypeptide, or other compound (e.g., a heterologous nucleic acid) that is to be introduced in accordance with the present invention into a recipient or host cell. In some embodiments, the particular source organism to be selected is not essential to the practice of the present disclosure. Relevant considerations may include, for example, how closely related the potential source and host organisms are in evolution, or how related the source organism is with other source organisms from which sequences of other relevant nucleic acids and/or polypeptides have been selected. Where a plurality of different heterologous nucleic acids are to be introduced into and/or expressed by a host cell, different sequences may be from different source organisms, or from the same source organism. To give but one example, in some cases, individual polypeptides may represent individual subunits of a complex protein activity and/or may be required to work in concert with other polypeptides in order to achieve the goals of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, it will often be desirable for such polypeptides to be from the same source organism, and/or to be sufficiently related to function appropriately when expressed together in a host cell. In some embodiments, such polypeptides may be from different, even unrelated source organisms. It will further be understood that, where a heterologous polypeptide is to be expressed in a host cell, it will often be desirable to utilize nucleic acid sequences encoding the polypeptide that have been adjusted to accommodate codon preferences of the host cell and/or to link the encoding sequences with regulatory elements active in the host cell. In certain embodiments, a gene sequence encoding a given polypeptide is optimized even when such a gene sequence is derived from the host cell itself (and thus is not heterologous). For example, a gene sequence encoding a polypeptide of interest may not be codon optimized for expression in a given host cell even though such a gene sequence is isolated from the host cell strain. In such embodiments, the gene sequence may be further optimized to account for codon preferences of the host cell. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of host cell codon preferences and will be able to employ the methods and reagents described herein and/or known in the art to accommodate them.
Subject: As used herein, the term "subject" or "patient" refers to any organism to which agents or compositions in accordance with the invention may be administered, e.g., for experimental, diagnostic, prophylactic, and/or therapeutic purposes. Typical subjects include animals (e.g., mammals such as mice, rats, rabbits, non-human primates, and humans; insects; worms; etc.).
Substantially: As used herein, the term "substantially" refers to the qualitative condition of exhibiting total or near-total extent or degree of a characteristic or property of interest. One of ordinary skill in the biological arts will understand that biological and chemical phenomena rarely, if ever, go to completion and/or proceed to completeness or achieve or avoid an absolute result. The term "substantially" is therefore used herein to capture the potential lack of completeness inherent in many biological and chemical phenomena.
Suffering from: An individual who is "suffering from" a disease, disorder, and/or condition has been diagnosed with or displays one or more symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition.
Susceptible to: An individual who is "susceptible to" a disease, disorder, and/or condition has not been diagnosed with the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition may not exhibit symptoms of the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition. In some embodiments, an individual who is susceptible to a disease, disorder, and/or condition will not develop the disease, disorder, and/or condition.
Therapeutic agent: As used herein, the phrase "therapeutic agent" refers to any agent that, when administered to a subject, has a therapeutic effect and/or elicits a desired biological and/or pharmacological effect. In some embodiments, a therapeutic agent of the invention refers to a peptide inhibitor or derivatives thereof according to the invention.
Therapeutic index: As used herein, the phrase "therapeutic index" refers to a quantitative measure of the selectivity of a drug when a therapeutic effect ("E") and a toxic effect ("T") are being compared. The therapeutic index can then be calculated as ED50/TD50, at some arbitrary level of response observed in a subject receiving the drug. The ED50 is the dose required to generate the desired intensity of therapeutic effect in 50% of the subjects tested. The TD50 is the dose required to generate the toxic effect in 50% of the subjects tested.
Treating: As used herein, the term "treat," "treatment," or "treating" refers to any method used to partially or completely alleviate, ameliorate, relieve, inhibit, prevent, delay onset of, reduce severity of and/or reduce incidence of one or more symptoms or features of a particular disease, disorder, and/or condition. Treatment may be administered to a subject who does not exhibit signs of a disease and/or exhibits only early signs of the disease for the purpose of decreasing the risk of developing pathology associated with the disease.
Vector: As used herein, "vector" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of transporting another nucleic acid to which it has been linked. In some embodiment, vectors are capable of extra-chromosomal replication and/or expression of nucleic acids to which they are linked in a host cell such as a eukaryotic and/or prokaryotic cell. Vectors capable of directing the expression of operatively linked genes are referred to herein as "expression vectors."

In any case where a chemical variable (e.g., an R group) is shown attached to a bond that crosses a bond of ring, this means that one or more such variables are optionally attached to the ring having the crossed bond. Each R group on such a ring can be attached at any suitable position, this is generally understood to mean that the group is attached in place of a hydrogen atom on the parent ring. This includes the possibility that two R groups can be attached to the same ring atom. Furthermore, when more than one R group is present on a ring, each may be the same or different than other R groups attached thereto, and each group is defined independently of other groups that may be attached elsewhere on the same molecule, even though they may be represented by the same identifier.

Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments
In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of identifying agents that interact with a PRPK/TPRKB complex. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of identifying agents that interact with a KEOPS complex comprising PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and LAGE3 and its homologs. In some embodiments, such methods include high throughput screening methods. In some embodiments, the methods include in vitro, in cyto and/or in vivo assays. In certain embodiments, the present invention encompasses agents identified by inventive methods.
Methods of identifying agents that modulate PRPK are also disclosed.

PRPK-TPRKB and KEOPS complex
The inventors have surprisingly found that PRPK and TPRKB mediate the immunomodulatory and growth inhibitory activities of compounds such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide. PRPK and TPRKB were captured by affinity reagents based on lenalidomide, pomalidomide, and thalidomide.
PRPK and TPRKB are evolutionarily conserved from archaea and yeast to humans; yet very little is known about the function of these proteins, particularly in humans. There are a limited number of publications describing these human proteins and below is a summary of the key literature findings.
In yeast and archaea, Bud32 and Cgi121 (PRPK and TPRKB, respectively) have previously been demonstrated to form a functional complex named KEOPS with two other proteins called Kae1 and Pee1. The yeast KEOPS complex is required for telomere maintenance and transcriptional regulation (Downey et al, Cell 124:1155-1168 (2006); Kisseleva-Romanova et al, EMBO J. 25:3576-3585 (2006)). The structure of the KEOPS complex has been studied by crystallography, although the proteins were of mixed origin (mostly archaea) (Mao et al, Mol Cell 32:259-275 (2008); Hecker et al, EMBO J. 27:2340-2351 (2008)). Structure-based sequence alignments indicate that Bud32 (PRPK) is an atypical kinase that possesses an architecture characteristic of protein kinases but lacks an activation loop that is normally responsible for substrate recognition. Formation and biological function of the human KEOPS complex has not been previously disclosed.
The inventors have further determined that the human orthologues of the two other proteins in the KEOPS complex, OSGEP and LAGE3 and its homologs (Kae1 and Pcc1, respectively), are also captured by a pomalidomide-based affinity reagent. This is the first evidence that a KEOPS complex may form in humans. In the literature, there are very few reports describing potential functions of PRPK and TPRKB. PRPK was first identified as a transcript that is up-regulated in IL-2 activated cytolytic T cells (Abe et al, J. Biol. Chem. 276:44003-44011 (2001)). It has been suggested that PRPK might possess kinase activity and phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 in vitro (Facchin et al (2003) FEBS Letters 549: 63). Kinase activity of recombinant PRPK was not observed unless PRPK was preincubated with cell lysates, suggesting that PRPK may be regulated by other cellular component(s). The physical interaction between PRPK and TPRKB has been demonstrated in vitro (Miyoshi et al, (2003) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 303:399-405) and there is evidence that PRPK may be activated by Akt (Facchin et al, Cell Mol Life Sci 64:2680-2689 (2007), suggesting that it could be part of an important regulatory pathway relevant to cancer. The human homologs of LAGE3 such as CTAG2 and CTG1B are known as cancer/testis antigens which express specifically in cancer and testis and are a target for cancer immunotherapy (Caballero et al, Cancer Sci (2009) 100, 2014) and may also form a KEOPS complex.
PRPK-TPRKB and KEOPS complex modulators
The invention provides methods of identifying an agent that modulates the activity of a PRPK/TPRKB complex for use in the treatment of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with cell proliferation, IL-2 production, TNF-α production, or natural killer activation comprising providing a PRPK/TPRKB complex. Inventive methods comprise providing a PRPK/TPRKB complex comprising PRPK and TPRKB, providing a test agent having a structure of formula I, contacting the test agent with the PRPK/TPRKB complex, and detecting an interaction between the test agent and at least one of PRPK and TPRKB
Test agents
In general, any agent having a structure of formula I can be screened in at method according to the invention. In some embodiments, a plurality of test agents is screened according to the invention. Exemplary test agents having a structure of formula I include, but are not limited to, chemical compounds, small molecules, co-crystals, nano-crystals, or any combination thereof. Test agents having a structure of formula I can also be designed using computer-based rational drug design methods. Typically, a plurality of test agents having a structure of formula I (e.g., libraries of test agents) are tested in screening assays for potential modulators. For example, test agents having a structure of formula I may be provided as chemically synthesized libraries. In some embodiments, test agents having a structure of formula I are provided as combinatorial libraries. In certain embodiments, a library is designed in silico and synthesized for screening.
In some embodiments, small molecule test agents having a structure of formula I are screened using methods according to the present invention. In some embodiments, compound libraries synthesized de novo can be screened to identify novel compounds that have target modulatory functions. In some embodiments, public libraries containing drugs (including FDA approved drugs) can be screened to identify existing compounds whose target modulating activities are previously unknown. In some embodiments, modified libraries containing derivatives or analogues of existing compounds can be synthesized using methods well known in the art and screened to identify novel or improved target modulators. In some embodiments, small molecules are screened individually.
In some embodiments, rational drug design may be used to predict and/or produce structural analogs of known biologically-active candidate substances. By creating such analogs, it is possible to fashion drugs which may be more active and/or stable than the natural substances, may have different susceptibility to alteration, and/or may affect the function of various other molecules. In one approach, one would generate a three-dimensional structure for a known candidate substance and/or characteristic portion thereof. In some embodiments, generation of a three-dimensional structure is accomplished by x-ray crystallography, NMR structure, computer modeling, and/or by a combination of these approaches.

Identification and/or characterization of PRPK-TPRKB and KEOPS complex modulators
The present invention provides methods of identifying agents that modulate PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. In some embodiments, an inventive method screens for modulators of PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by identifying agents that bind to PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. In some embodiments, an inventive method identifies modulators of PRPK, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by identifying agents that modulate PRPK kinase activity. In yet other embodiments, the inventive method identifies modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by identifying agents that modulate expression and/or levels of of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and/or LAGE3 and its homologs. In some embodiments, an inventive method screens for modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by identifying agents that activate natural killer cells. In some embodiments, an inventive method screens for modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by identifying agents that induce immune synapse formation.
As used herein, the phrase "biological target" refers to (1) a PRPK protein, a nucleic acid encoding PRPK, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (2) a TPRKB protein, a nucleic acid encoding TPRKB, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (3) a OSGEP protein, a nucleic acid encoding OSGEP, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; (4) an LAGE3 and its homologs protein, a nucleic acid encoding LAGE3 and its homologs, and/or homolog, portion, variant, mutant, and/or derivative thereof; and/or (5) a complex of any two or more of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and/or LAGE3 and its homologs.
The efficacy of the test agent may be assessed by generating dose response curves from data obtained using various concentrations of the test agent. Moreover, a control assay may be performed to provide a baseline for comparison. In certain embodiments, a control assay is performed in the absence of a candidate substance. In certain embodiments, a control assay is performed in the presence of a reference agent.
In some embodiments, agents identified according to the invention inhibit and/or activate PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more as compared with the activity observed under otherwise identical conditions lacking a test agent. In some embodiments, agents identified according to the invention inhibit and/or activate PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99% or more as compared with the activity observed under comparable conditions using a reference standard.
It will be understood that all screening methods of the present invention are useful in themselves notwithstanding the fact that effective agents may not be found. The invention provides methods for screening for test agents, not solely methods of finding effective agents.
Screening
Screening for modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex is employed. In some embodiments, high throughput screening for modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex is employed. In some embodiments, such screening identifies substances that bind to PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex.
In high throughput assays of the invention, it is possible to screen up to several thousand test agents in a single day. Each well of a microtiter plate can be used to run a separate assay against a selected test agent, or, if concentration and/or incubation time effects are to be observed, every 5-10 wells can test a single test agent. Thus, a single standard microtiter plate can assay 96 test agents. If 1536 well plates are used, then a single plate can easily assay from about 100 to about 1500 different test agents. It is possible to assay many plates per day; assay screens for up to about 6,000, 20,000, 50,000, or more than 100,000 different test agents are possible.
For a solid state reaction, the biological target of interest may be bound to the solid state component, directly or indirectly, via covalent and/or non covalent linkage e.g., via a tag. The tag may comprise any of a variety of components. In general, a substance which binds the tag (a tag binder) is fixed to a solid support, and the tagged molecule of interest is attached to the solid support by interaction of the tag and/or the tag binder.
A number of tags and/or tag binders may be used, based upon known molecular interactions well described in the literature. For example, where a tag has a natural binder, for example, biotin, protein A, and/or protein G, it may be used in conjunction with appropriate tag binders (avidin, streptavidin, neutravidin, the Fc region of an immunoglobulin, etc.). Antibodies to molecules with natural binders such as biotin and/or appropriate tag binders are widely available (Sigma Immunochemicals, 1998 catalogue, St. Louis, MO).
Similarly, any haptenic and/or antigenic compound may be used in combination with an appropriate antibody to form a tag/tag binder pair. Thousands of specific antibodies are commercially available and many additional antibodies are described in the literature. For example, in one common configuration, the tag is a first antibody and the tag binder is a second antibody which recognizes the first antibody. In addition to antibody-antigen interactions, receptor-ligand interactions are appropriate as tag and/or tag-binder pairs, including but not limited to transferrin, c-kit, viral receptor ligands, cytokine receptors, chemokine receptors, interleukin receptors, immunoglobulin receptors and/or antibodies, the cadherin family, the integrin family, the selectin family, etc. (see, e.g., Pigott et al., The Adhesion Molecule Facts Book I, 1993). Similarly, toxins and/or venoms; viral epitopes; hormones (e.g. opiates, steroids, etc.); intracellular receptors (e.g. which mediate the effects of various small ligands, including steroids, thyroid hormone, retinoids, vitamin D, and/or peptides); drugs; lectins; carbohydrates; nucleic acids (linear and/or cyclic polymer configurations); proteins; phospholipids; and/or antibodies may interact with various cell receptors.
Synthetic polymers, such as polyurethanes, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyureas, polyamides, polyethyleneimines, polyarylene sulfides, polysiloxanes, polyimides, and/or polyacetates may form appropriate tags and/or tag binders. Many other tag/tag binder pairs are useful in assay systems described herein, as would be apparent to one skilled in the art.
Common linkers such as peptides, polyethers, and the like may serve as tags and may include polypeptide sequences, such as poly-Gly sequences of between about 5 and 200 amino acids. Such flexible linkers are known to persons of skill in the art. For example, poly(ethelyne glycol) linkers are available from Shearwater Polymers, Inc. (Huntsville, AL). These linkers optionally have amide linkages, sulfhydryl linkages, and/or heterofunctional linkages.
Tag binders are fixed to solid substrates using any of a variety of methods currently available. Solid substrates are commonly derivatized and/or functionalized by exposing all and/or a portion of the substrate to a chemical reagent which fixes a chemical group to the surface which is reactive with a portion of the tag binder. For example, groups which are suitable for attachment to a longer chain portion include amines, hydroxyl, thiol, and/or carboxyl groups. Aminoalkylsilanes and/or hydroxyalkylsilanes may be used to functionalize a variety of surfaces, such as glass surfaces. The construction of such solid phase biopolymer arrays is well described in the literature (see, e.g., Merrifield, 1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149, describing solid phase synthesis of, e.g., peptides; Geysen et al., 1987, J. Immun. Meth. 102:259, describing synthesis of solid phase components on pins; Frank et al., 1988, Tetrahedron 44:6031, describing synthesis of various peptide sequences on cellulose disks); Fodor et al., 1991, Science, 251:767; Sheldon et al., 1993, Clinical Chemistry 39(4):718; and Kozal et al., 1996, Nature Medicine 2:753; all describing arrays of biopolymers fixed to solid substrates). Non-chemical approaches for fixing tag binders to substrates include other common methods, such as heat, cross-linking by UV radiation, and the like.
In Vitro Assays
The present invention provides in vitro methods for screening a modulator of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. For example, in some embodiments, a method generally comprises steps of: (1) providing a PRPK/TPRKB complex comprising PRPK and TPRKB; (2) providing a test agent having a structure of formula I; (3) contacting the test agent with the PRPK/TPRKB complex; and(4) detecting an interaction between the test agent and at least one of PRPK and TPRKB..
In general, PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex is provided and brought directly and/or indirectly into contact with a test agent. Then, modulation of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by the test agent is detected and/or measured. Thereafter, suitable agents may be isolated and/or analyzed. For the screening of libraries, the use of high-throughput assays, which are known to the skilled person, are commercially available, and are described herein.
In some embodiments, in vitro assays comprise binding assays. Binding of a candidate substance to a biological target (e.g. PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex) may, in and of itself, be inhibitory, due to steric, allosteric, and/or charge-charge interactions. The biological target may be free in solution, fixed to a support, and/or expressed in and/or on the surface of a cell. The biological target and/or the test agent may be labeled, thereby permitting detection of binding. The biological target is frequently the labeled species, decreasing the chance that the labeling will interfere with and/or enhance binding. Competitive binding formats may be performed in which one of the test agents is labeled, and one may measure the amount of free label versus bound label to determine the effect on binding.
In some embodiments, binding assays involve exposing a biological target to a test agent and detecting binding between the biological target and the test agent. The binding assay may be conducted in vitro (e.g. in a test tube, comprising substantially only the components mentioned; in cell-free extracts; and/or in substantially purified components). Alternatively or additionally, the assays may be conducted in cyto and/or in vivo (e.g. within a cell, tissue, organ, and/or organism; described in further detail below).
In certain embodiments, a test agent is contacted with PRPK/TPRKB complex as a biological target and an effect detected. In some embodiments, an assay for identifying agents that bind to a biological target, which is immobilized on a solid support, with a non-immobilized test agent is used to determine whether and/or to what extent the biological target and test agent bind to each other. Alternatively, the test agent may be immobilized and the biological target non-immobilized. Such assays may be used to identify agents capable of binding to PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex.
In one embodiment, an antibody that recognizes the biological target (e.g. a PRPK antibody) is bound to a solid support (e.g. Protein-A beads). The antibody is contacted with the biological target, which binds to the immobilized antibody. The resulting complex is then brought into contact with the test agent (purified protein, cellular extract, combinatorial library, etc.). If the test agent interacts with the biological target, the test agent will become indirectly immobilized to the solid support. Presence of the test agent on the solid support can be assayed by any standard technique known in the art (including, but not limited to, western blotting). This type of assay is known in the art as an "immunoprecipitation" assay.
In one embodiment, a biological target (e.g., PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex) is immobilized on beads, such as agarose beads. In certain embodiments, PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, and/or a characteristic portion thereof is expressed as a GST-fusion protein in bacteria, yeast, insect, and/or higher eukaryotic cell line and/or purified from crude cell extracts using glutathione-agarose beads. As a control, binding of the test agent, which is not a GST-fusion protein, to the immobilized biological target is determined in the absence of biological target. The binding of the test agent to the immobilized biological target is then determined. This type of assay is known in the art as a "GST pulldown" assay. Alternatively or additionally, the test agent may be immobilized and the biological target non-immobilized.
It is possible to perform this type of assay using different affinity purification systems for immobilizing one of the components, for example Ni-NTA agarose- and/or histidine-tagged components.
Binding of a biological target to a test agent may be determined by a variety of methods well-known in the art. For example, a non-immobilized component may be labeled (with for example, a radioactive label, an epitope tag, and/or an enzyme-antibody conjugate). Alternatively, binding may be determined by immunological detection techniques. For example, a reaction mixture may be Western blotted and the blot probed with an antibody that detects the non-immobilized component. Alternatively or additionally, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) may be utilized to assay for binding.
The activity of PRPK, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex modulators identified according to the present invention may be determined by, for example, assaying for kinase activity of PRPK. In such assays PRPK and/or a characteristic portion thereof produced by recombinant means is contacted with a substrate in the presence of a suitable phosphate donor (e.g. ATP) containing radiolabeled phosphate, and PRPK-dependent incorporation of radiolabel into the substrate is measured. By "substrate," one means any substance containing a suitable hydroxyl moiety that acts as an acceptor for the γ-phosphate group transferred from a donor molecule such as ATP in a reaction catalyzed by PRPK. The substrate may be an endogenous substrate of PRPK (e.g., p53). The substrate may be a protein or peptide, and the phosphorylation reaction may occur on a substrate serine and/or threonine residue. It is well-known to those skilled in the art that non-natural substrates can act as suitable substrates in kinase assays such as that described above, and examples of specific substrates which are commonly employed in such assays include, but are not limited to, histone proteins or any myelin basic protein.
It is well known to those skilled in the art that detection of kinase-dependent substrate phosphorylation can be effected by a number of means other than measurement of radiolabeled phosphate incorporation into the substrate. For example, incorporation of phosphate groups can affect physicochemical properties of the substrate, such as electrophoretic mobility, light absorbance, fluorescence and/or phosphorescence, chromatographic properties and the like. Such alterations of substrate physicochemical properties can be readily measured by one skilled in the art and used as an indicator of kinase activity.
In Cvto Assays
In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of screening for modulators of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex wherein the test agent is contacted with a cell. The cell can then be assayed for various parameters associated with activity of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. In some embodiments, the cell overexpresses one or more members of the PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or of the KEOPS complex and/or contains a modification of a biological pathway in which one or both of these complexes operates. Overexpressing and/or modified cells are also disclosed; those of skill in the art, reading the present disclosure, would be well apprised of the boundaries of such cells and well aware of the wide variety of established and readily available strategies for constructing, characterizing, and/or utilizing such cells.
In certain embodiments, cells may be directly assayed for binding between two or more of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs. Immunohistochemical techniques, confocal techniques, and/or other techniques to assess binding are well known to those of skill in the art. Various cell lines may be utilized for such screening assays, including cells specifically engineered for this purpose. Examples of cells used in the screening assays include Jeko-1, NCI-H929, Jurkat, PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells), HS-Sultan, multiple myeloma cell lines, HEK-293FT, Raji, Daudi, Ramos, B cell lines, T cell lines. The cell may be a stimulated cell, such as a cell stimulated with a growth factor. One of skill in the art would understand that the invention disclosed herein encompasses a wide variety of in cyto assays for measuring parameters that correlate with the activity of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex.
Depending on the assay, cell and/or tissue culture may be required. The cell may be examined using any of a number of different physiologic assays, as discussed above for binding between two or more of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs. Alternatively, molecular analysis may be performed, including, but not limited to, western blotting to monitor protein expression and/or test for protein-protein interactions; northern blotting, differential display of RNA, and/or microarray analysis to monitor mRNA expression; kinase assays to monitor phosphorylation; mass spectrometry to monitor other chemical modifications; etc.
The present invention provides methods for identifying agents that bind to PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex and, therefore, may modulate activity of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. One in cyto method of identifying substances that bind to PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex is the two-hybrid system assay (Fields et al., 1994, Trends in Genetics 10:286; and Colas et al., 1998, TIBTECH 16:355). In this assay, yeast cells express a first fusion protein consisting of the biological target according to the invention (e.g. PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex) and a DNA-binding domain of a transcription factor such as Gal4 and/or LexA. The cells additionally contain a reporter gene whose promoter contains binding sites for the corresponding DNA-binding domain. By transforming the cells with a vector that expresses a second fusion protein consisting of a candidate substance fused to an activation domain (e.g. from Gal4 and/or herpes simplex virus VP16) the expression of the reporter gene may be greatly increased if the test agent interacts with the biological target.
Another assay is based on solid phase-bound biological target and its interaction with the test agents to be screened. Thus, a biological target (e.g. PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex) may contain a detectable marker, such as a radioactive, fluorescent, and/or luminescent label. Furthermore, candidate substances can be coupled to other substances which permit indirect detection (e.g. by means of employing an enzyme which uses a chromogenic substrate and/or by means of binding a detectable antibody). Changes in the conformation of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex as the result of an interaction with a test agent may be detected, for example, by the change in the emission of the detectable marker. Alternatively or additionally, the solid phase-bound protein complexes may be analyzed by means of mass spectrometry.
In some embodiments, screening assays may assay activity of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex by monitoring the downstream cellular effects of activity of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. Such effects include, but are not limited to, phosphorylation of p53 and signaling effects in the PI3K/AKT pathway, and/or other cellular responses, such as growth, growth arrest, differentiation, changes in glycosylation, changes in gene expression, regulation of transcription, effects on telomere length, effects on cytokine production and/or apoptosis.
In another embodiment, levels PRPK, and/or TPRKB, and its homologs are determined by measuring the level of protein and/or mRNA. The level of protein and/or characteristic portions thereof are measured using immunoassays such as western blotting and/or ELISA using antibodies that selectively bind to PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, and/or LAGE3 and its homologs. For measurement of mRNA, amplification (e.g., using PCR, LCR) and/or hybridization assays (e.g., northern hybridization, RNAse protection, dot blotting) may be used. The level of protein and/or mRNA is detected using directly- and/or indirectly- labeled detection agents, e.g., fluorescently and/or radioactively labeled nucleic acids, radioactively and/or enzymatically labeled antibodies, etc. as described herein.
Alternatively or additionally, expression of PRPK, and/or TPRKB, and its homologs may be measured using a reporter gene system. Such a system may be devised using a PRPK, and/or TPRKB, and its homologs protein promoter operably-linked to a reporter gene such as chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, firefly luciferase, bacterial luciferase, O-galactosidase, and/or alkaline phosphatase. Furthermore, PRPK, and/or TPRKB, and its homologs may be used as an indirect reporter via attachment to a second reporter such as red and/or green fluorescent protein (see, e.g., Mistili et al., 1997, Nature Biotech. 15:961). The reporter construct is typically transfected into a cell. After treatment with a candidate substance, the amount of reporter gene transcription, translation, and/or activity is measured according to standard techniques known to those of skill in the art.
In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods to determine whether PRPK can induce phosphorylation of p53 in vivo. In such methods, cells are transfected with vectors expressing wild-type or mutant PRPK and/or p53. Cell extracts or whole cells are prepared at specified time points after transfection, and the degree of phosphorylation of p53 is analyzed by western blotting or mass-spectrometry (lysates) or by in-cell western, immunofluorescence, or high content imaging (whole cells).
In vivo Assays
In vivo assays involve the use of various animal models, including transgenic animals that have been engineered to have specific defects and/or carry markers that can be used to measure the ability of a candidate substance to reach and/or affect different cells within the organism. Due to their size, ease of handling, and/or information on their physiology and/or genetic make-up, mice are one embodiment, especially for transgenics. However, other animals are suitable as well, including rats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, gerbils, woodchucks, cats, dogs, sheep, goats, pigs, cows, horses and/or monkeys (including chimps, gibbons and/or baboons). Assays for modulators may be conducted using an animal model derived from any of these species and/or other useful species not listed herein.
In such assays, one or more test agents are administered to an animal, and the ability of the test agent(s) to alter one or more characteristics, as compared to a similar animal not treated with the test agent(s), identifies a modulator. The characteristics may be any of those discussed herein with regard to the symptoms associated with cell proliferation, IL-2 production, TNF-α production, and any other effect of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex (e.g., inflammation, inflammatory disease, autoimmune disease, oncogenic or cancerous conditions, etc).
The present invention provides methods of screening for an agent that may treat, stabilize, and/or delay the onset of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. In some embodiments, the agent comprises a modulator of PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. Treatment of these animals with agents according to the invention will involve the administration of the substance, in an appropriate form, to the animal. Administration will be by any route that could be utilized for clinical and/or non-clinical purposes, including but not limited to oral, nasal, buccal, and/or topical. Alternatively or additionally, administration may be by intratracheal instillation, bronchial instillation, intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, inhalation, and/or intravenous injection (e.g., systemic intravenous injection), regional administration via blood and/or lymph supply, and/or direct administration to an affected site.
Accordingly, in one aspect, the invention discloses a screening system, including methods and/or compositions, for determining whether an agent is useful for treating, stabilizing, and/or delaying the onset of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex in a mammal. In some embodiments, the candidate substance is determined to treat, stabilize, and/or delay the onset of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex if the substance improves, stabilizes, and/or delays the onset of the symptoms associated with such as disease, disorder, or condition.
Determining the effectiveness of a compound in vivo may involve a variety of different criteria. Measuring toxicity and/or dose response may be performed in animals in a more meaningful fashion than in in vitro and/or in cyto assays. In vivo assays may include animal disease models for multiple myeloma, angiogenesis inhibition, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia, solid tumor animal models, any oncology-related animal models, inflammation animal models and auto-immune disease animal models.

Pharmaceutical compositions
The present invention provides methods of identifying an agent that modulates the activity of a PRPK/TPRKB complex for use in the treatment of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with cell proliferation, IL-2 production, TNF-α production, or natural killer activation. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising modulators are described herein. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more modulator(s) of PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex appropriately formulated for administration to a subject are disclosed. Such pharmaceutical compositions may optionally comprise one or more additional therapeutically-active substances.
A method of treating a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex is disclosed. The method comprises administering a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one modulator identified according to the present invention to a patient in need thereof. Modulators identified according to the present invention may be administered with other medications used to treat the symptoms of the particular disease, disorder, or condition to be treated. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered to humans.
The preparation and/or use of pharmaceutical compositions comprising a modulators identified according to the present invention as an active ingredient are also disclosed. Such a pharmaceutical composition may consist of the active ingredient alone, in a form suitable for administration to a subject, or the pharmaceutical composition may comprise the active ingredient and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, one or more additional ingredients, and/or a combination of these. The active ingredient may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in the form of a physiologically acceptable ester and/or salt, such as in combination with a physiologically acceptable cation and/or anion, as is well known in the art.
As used herein, the term "physiologically acceptable" ester and/or salt means an ester and/or salt form of the active ingredient which is compatible with any other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition, which is not deleterious to the subject to which the composition is to be administered.
The formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be prepared by any method known or hereafter developed in the art of pharmacology. In general, such preparatory methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with a carrier and/or one or more other accessory ingredients, and then, if necessary and/or desirable, shaping and/or packaging the product into a desired single- or multi-dose unit.
Although the descriptions of pharmaceutical compositions provided herein are principally directed to pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for administration to humans, it will be understood by the skilled artisan that such compositions are generally suitable for administration to animals of all sorts. Modification of pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration to humans in order to render the compositions suitable for administration to various animals is well understood, and the ordinarily skilled veterinary pharmacologist can design and/or perform such modification with merely ordinary, if any, experimentation. Subjects to which administration of the pharmaceutical compositions is contemplated include, but are not limited to, humans and/or other primates; mammals, including commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, cats, and/or dogs; and/or birds, including commercially relevant birds such as chickens, ducks, geese, and/or turkeys.
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in bulk, as a single unit dose, and/or as a plurality of single unit doses. As used herein, a "unit dose" is discrete amount of the pharmaceutical composition comprising a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. The amount of the active ingredient is generally equal to the dosage of the active ingredient which would be administered to a subject and/or a convenient fraction of such a dosage such as, for example, one-half or one-third of such a dosage.
The relative amounts of the active ingredient, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and/or any additional ingredients in a pharmaceutical composition will vary, depending upon the identity, size, and/or condition of the subject treated and further depending upon the route by which the composition is to be administered. By way of example, the composition may comprise between 0.1% and 100% (w/w) active ingredient.
In general, a pharmaceutical composition will include a therapeutic agent in addition to one or more additional ingredients, including, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: excipients; surface active agents; dispersing agents; inert diluents; granulating and/or disintegrating agents; binding agents; lubricating agents; sweetening agents; flavoring agents; coloring agents; preservatives; physiologically degradable compositions such as gelatin; aqueous vehicles and/or solvents; oily vehicles and/or solvents; suspending agents; dispersing and/or wetting agents; emulsifying agents, demulcents; buffers; salts; thickening agents; fillers; emulsifying agents; antioxidants; antibiotics; antifungal agents; stabilizing agents; pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric and/or hydrophobic materials; and/or combinations thereof, as suited to the particular dosage form desired. Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005) discloses other additional ingredients which may be used in formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and/or known techniques for the preparation thereof.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension and/or solution. This suspension and/or solution may be formulated according to the known art, and may comprise, in addition to the active ingredient, additional ingredients such as the dispersing agents, wetting agents, and/or suspending agents described herein. Such sterile injectable formulations may be prepared using a non toxic parenterally acceptable diluent and/or solvent, such as water and/or 1,3 butane diol, for example. Other acceptable diluents and/or solvents include, but are not limited to, Ringer's solution, isotonic sodium chloride solution, and/or fixed oils such as synthetic mono- and/or di-glycerides. Other parentally-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form, in a liposomal preparation, and/or as a component of a biodegradable polymer systems. Compositions for sustained release and/or implantation may comprise pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric and/or hydrophobic materials such as an emulsion, an ion exchange resin, a sparingly soluble polymer, and/or a sparingly soluble salt.
In order to prolong the effect of a compound, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous and/or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline and/or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and/or crystalline form. Alternatively or additionally, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form can be accomplished by dissolving and/or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer and/or the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and/or poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are prepared by entrapping the compound in liposomes and/or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.
Injectable formulations may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter, and/or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which may be dissolved and/or dispersed in sterile water and/or other sterile injectable medium prior to use.
A formulation of a pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral administration may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in the form of a discrete solid dose unit including, but not limited to, a tablet, a hard or soft capsule, a cachet, a troche, and/or a lozenge, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient. Other formulations suitable for oral administration include, but are not limited to, a powdered and/or granular formulation, an aqueous or oily suspension, an aqueous or oily solution, and/or an emulsion. As used herein, an "oily" liquid is one which comprises a carbon-containing liquid molecule and which exhibits a less polar character than water.
Powdered and/or granular formulations of a pharmaceutical preparationmay be prepared using known methods. Such formulations may be administered directly to an apparatus, used, for example, to form tablets, to fill capsules, and/or to prepare an aqueous or oily suspension and/or solution by addition of an aqueous or oily vehicle thereto.
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in the form of oil in water emulsion and/or a water-in-oil emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil such as olive and/or arachis oil, a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin, and/or a combination of these. Such compositions may further comprise one or more emulsifying agents such as naturally occurring gums such as gum acacia and/or gum tragacanth, naturally occurring phosphatides such as soybean and/or lecithin phosphatide, esters and/or partial esters derived from combinations of fatty acids and/or hexitol anhydrides such as sorbitan monooleate, and/or condensation products of such partial esters with ethylene oxide such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate.

Known preservatives include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, and/or n-propyl para hydroxybenzoates, ascorbic acid, and/or sorbic acid. Known sweetening agents include, for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol, sucrose, and/or saccharin. Known thickening agents for oily suspensions include, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin, and/or cetyl alcohol.
Liquid solutions of the active ingredient in aqueous or oily solvents may be prepared in substantially the same manner as liquid suspensions, the primary difference being that the active ingredient is dissolved, rather than suspended in the solvent. Liquid solutions of the pharmaceutical composition may comprise each of the components described with regard to liquid suspensions, it being understood that suspending agents will not necessarily aid dissolution of the active ingredient in the solvent. Aqueous solvents include, for example, water and/or isotonic saline. Oily solvents include, for example, almond oil, peanut oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, vegetable oils such as arachis, olive, sesame, and/or coconut oil, fractionated vegetable oils, and/or mineral oils such as liquid paraffin.

In the case of capsules, tablets and/or pills, the dosage form may comprise buffering agents.
Solid compositions may be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules, for example using such excipients as lactose and/or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, etc. Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and/or granules can be prepared with coatings and/or shells such as enteric coatings and/or other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and/or can be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, and/or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that may be used include polymeric substances and/or waxes.
Solid compositions may be prepared in a micro-encapsulated form with one or more excipients as noted above. For example, tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and/or granules may be prepared with coatings and/or shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling coatings and/or other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose and/or starch. Such dosage forms may comprise, as is normal practice, additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and/or other tableting aids such a magnesium stearate and/or microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets and/or pills, the dosage forms may comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and/or may be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.

Alternatively or additionally, conventional syringes may be used in the classical mantoux method of intradermal administration.
Formulations suitable for topical administration include, but are not limited to, liquid and/or semi liquid preparations such as liniments, lotions, oil in water and/or water in oil emulsions such as creams, ointments and/or pastes, and/or solutions and/or suspensions. Topically-administrable formulations may, for example, comprise from about 1% to about 10% (w/w) active ingredient, although the concentration of the active ingredient may be as high as the solubility limit of the active ingredient in the solvent. Formulations for topical administration may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for pulmonary administration via the buccal cavity. Such a formulation may comprise dry particles which comprise the active ingredient and which have a diameter in the range from about 0.5 to about 7 nanometers or from about 1 to about 6 nanometers. Such compositions are conveniently in the form of dry powders for administration using a device comprising a dry powder reservoir to which a stream of propellant may be directed to disperse the powder and/or using a self propelling solvent/powder dispensing container such as a device comprising the active ingredient dissolved and/or suspended in a low-boiling propellant in a sealed container. Such powders comprise particles wherein at least 98% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 0.5 nanometers and at least 95% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 7 nanometers. Alternatively, at least 95% of the particles by weight have a diameter greater than 1 nanometer and at least 90% of the particles by number have a diameter less than 6 nanometers. Dry powder compositions may include a solid fine powder diluent such as sugar and are conveniently provided in a unit dose form.
Low boiling propellants generally include liquid propellants having a boiling point of below 65.degree. F. at atmospheric pressure. Generally the propellant may constitute 50 to 99.9% (w/w) of the composition, and the active ingredient may constitute 0.1 to 20% (w/w) of the composition. The propellant may further comprise additional ingredients such as a liquid non-ionic and/or solid anionic surfactant and/or a solid diluent (which may have a particle size of the same order as particles comprising the active ingredient).
Pharmaceutical compositions formulated for pulmonary delivery may provide the active ingredient in the form of droplets of a solution and/or suspension. Such formulations may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold as aqueous and/or dilute alcoholic solutions and/or suspensions, optionally sterile, comprising the active ingredient, and may conveniently be administered using any nebulization and/or atomization device. Such formulations may further comprise one or more additional ingredients including, but not limited to, a flavoring agent such as saccharin sodium, a volatile oil, a buffering agent, a surface active agent, and/or a preservative such as methylhydroxybenzoate. The droplets provided by this route of administration may have an average diameter in the range from about 0.1 to about 200 nanometers.
The formulations described herein as being useful for pulmonary delivery are useful for intranasal delivery of a pharmaceutical composition. Another formulation suitable for intranasal administration is a coarse powder comprising the active ingredient and having an average particle from about 0.2 to 500 micrometers. Such a formulation is administered in the manner in which snuff is taken, i.e. by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close to the nares.
Formulations suitable for nasal administration may, for example, comprise from about as little as 0.1% (w/w) and as much as 100% (w/w) of the active ingredient, and may comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for buccal administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of tablets and/or lozenges made using conventional methods, and may, for example, 0.1 to 20% (w/w) active ingredient, the balance comprising an orally dissolvable and/or degradable composition and, optionally, one or more of the additional ingredients described herein. Alternately, formulations suitable for buccal administration may comprise a powder and/or an aerosolized and/or atomized solution and/or suspension comprising the active ingredient. Such powdered, aerosolized, and/or aerosolized formulations, when dispersed, may have an average particle and/or droplet size in the range from about 0.1 to about 200 nanometers, and may further comprise one or more of the additional ingredients described herein.
A pharmaceutical composition may be prepared, packaged, and/or sold in a formulation suitable for ophthalmic administration. Such formulations may, for example, be in the form of eye drops including, for example, a 0.1/1.0% (w/w) solution and/or suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous or oily liquid carrier. Such drops may further comprise buffering agents, salts, and/or one or more other of the additional ingredients described herein. Other opthalmically-administrable formulations which are useful include those which comprise the active ingredient in microcrystalline form and/or in a liposomal preparation. Ear drops and/or eye drops are contemplated.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered by a variety of routes, including oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-arterial, intramedullary, intrathecal, subcutaneous, intraventricular, transdermal, interdermal, rectal, intravaginal, intraperitoneal, topical (as by powders, ointments, creams, and/or drops), mucosal, bucal, enteral, sublingual, and/or as an oral spray, nasal spray, and/or aerosol. In general the most appropriate route of administration will depend upon a variety of factors including the nature of the agent (e.g., its stability in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract), the condition of the patient (e.g., whether the patient is able to tolerate oral administration), etc. At present the oral and/or nasal spray and/or aerosol route is most commonly used to deliver therapeutic agents directly to the lungs and/or respiratory system. However, the delivery of the pharmaceutical composition by any appropriate route taking into consideration likely advances in the sciences of drug delivery is encompassed.
General considerations in the formulation and/or manufacture of pharmaceutical agents may be found, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy 21st ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005.
Administration
Typically, dosages of an agent which may be administered to an animal (e.g. a human) range in amount from 1 mg to about 100 g per kilogram of body weight of the subject. While the precise dosage administered will vary depending upon any number of factors, including but not limited to, the type of animal and/or type of disease state being treated, the age of the animal and/or the route of administration. In some embodiments, the dosage of the compound will vary from about 1 mg to about 10 g per kilogram of body weight of the animal. In some embodiments, the dosage will vary from about 10 mg to about 1 g per kilogram of body weight of the subject.
The compound may be administered to a subject as frequently as several times daily, and/or it may be administered less frequently, such as once a day, once a week, once every two weeks, once a month, and/or even less frequently, such as once every several months and/or even once a year or less. The frequency of the dose will be readily apparent to the skilled artisan and will depend upon any number of factors, such as, but not limited to, the type and/or severity of the disease being treated, the type and/or age of the subject, etc.
It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and/or pharmaceutical compositions will be decided by the attending physician and/or veterinarian within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient and/or subject will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient and/or subject; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination and/or coincidental with the specific compound employed, and/or like factors well known in the medical arts.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered either alone or in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. By "in combination with," it is not intended to imply that the agents must be administered at the same time and/or formulated for delivery togethe. In general, each agent will be administered at a dose and/or on a time schedule determined for that agent. Additionally, the delivery of the inventive pharmaceutical compositions in combination with agents that may improve their bioavailability, reduce and/or modify their metabolism, inhibit their excretion, and/or modify their distribution within the body is disclosed. Although the pharmaceutical compositions may be used for treatment of any subject (e.g., any animal) in need thereof, they are most preferably used in the treatment of humans.
The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics and/or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and/or the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the same disorder), and/or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).
The pharmaceutical compositions may be administered alone and/or in combination with other one or more agents that are used to treat the symptoms of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex. In some embodiments, such agents may include thalidomide, lenalidomide, and/or pomalidomide. In some embodiment, such an agent may include bortezomib or dexamethasone. In some embodiments, such an agent may include any approved oncology drug.
In will further be appreciated that therapeutically active agents utilized in combination may be administered together in a single composition or administered separately in different compositions.
In some embodiments, modulators identified according to the present invention may be administered in combination with one or more other modulators of a disease, condition, or disorder associated with PRPK, TPRKB, OSGEP, LAGE3 and its homologs, PRPK-TPRKB complex and/or KEOPS complex.

Exemplification
General Synthesis Information. All reactions were carried out in oven or flame-dried glassware under an argon atmosphere employing standard techniques in handling air-sensitive materials. All commercially obtained reagents and solvents were used as supplied. Anhydrous THF, DMSO, pyridine and DCM were purchased with molecular sieves from ACROS chemicals. Reactions were magnetically stirred and monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods. TLC was done using 0.25-mm E. Merck silica gel 60 F254 pre-coated plates and vanillin stain, molybdate stain or UV for visualization. Flash chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (particle size 0.032-0.063 mm) supplied by Sorbent Technologies. Agilent 1100 series LC-MSD single-quadrupole system with diode array detector and electrospray ion source was used for analytical runs as well as for the preparative reverse phase HPLC purifications. Agilent C-18 preparative column (21.2 x 100 mm, 5 µm) was used for all preparative HPLC purifications at a flow rate of 15 ml/min using mixtures of acetonitrile and water with 0.1% formic acid. Yields refer to chromatographically and spectroscopically pure compounds. 1H-NMR spectrum was recorded using an internal deuterium lock at ambient temperature on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer. An internal reference of δH 7.26 was used for CDCl3. NMR data are presented as follows: chemical shift (in ppm on the δ scale relative to δTMS = 0), integration, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet, dd = doublet of doublets, td = triplet of doublets, br = broad) and coupling constant (J/Hz). Resonances that are either partially or fully obscured are denoted obscured (obsc). Mass-spectra were obtained using Agilent 1100 series LC-MS.
General Cell Culture. Cell lines Jurkat, NCI-H929, HS-Sultan, HEK-293FT and JeKo-1 were obtained from ATCC and maintained by vendor-specified media requirements at 37°C in 5% CO2 incubators. Cryopreserved PBMCs were obtained from Astarte Biologics and thawed and maintained by vendor-specified media requirements.

IL-2 production assay (see Figures 1 and 8)
This protocol describes the technique to detect the amount of IL-2 produced by Jurkat and PBMCs in 96-well format. This assay was used to calculate IL-2 production EC50 values of lenalidomide, pomalidomide, all derivatives and inhibition with CMPD 31.
Cell plating and compound addition
Logarithmically growing Jurkat cells from ATCC (clone E6-1) or frozen and thawed human PBMCs from Astarte (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, normal Donor 41) were resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Cells were plated into each well of a 96-well anti-CD3 plate (Becton Dickinson catalogue number #354725) at 1 x 105 cells/100 µl per well. Controls were added to columns 1 and 12 where 0.1% DMSO in eight replicate wells represented the negative or 0% IL-2 production control and 0.1 µg/ml anti-CD28 antibody (Becton Dickinson catalog # 555725) in eight replicate wells represented the positive or 100% IL-2 production control.
Compounds were serially diluted 3- fold in 100% DMSO into duplicate 10-point dose curves using a Biomek FX liquid handler in columns 2 through 11 of a 96-well U-bottom plate. Starting concentration of compounds was 10 mM. Daughter plates containing 2 µL of the compound dose curves were stamped and stored at -80C.
Compound daughter plates were resuspended in 200 µL of RPMI-1640 medium as a 10X stock and then 20 µL of the 10X stock was added to each anti-CD3 antibody assay plate well with a final volume of 200 µl by the addition of 80µl of complete media. For the CMPD 31 IL-2 inhibition assays, a 10X stock (100 µM) of CMPD 31 in RPMI-1640 medium was prepared and diluted into each assay well at all concentrations of lenalidomide and pomalidomide at a final concentration of 10 µM. Assay plates were incubated for 18 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2. The amount of IL-2 produced was determined by an ELISA assay and was performed in one of two ways as per manufacturer instructions; by a standard ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) protocol method (Becton Dickinson) or an AlphaLISA protocol (Perkin Elmer).
IL-2 detection
Briefly, for the standard ELISA, 100 µl of supernatant from the compound-treated assay plate was added to each IL-2 detection ELISA plate well with 50 µl of diluent and the plate was incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Each plate was washed five times with 100 µl of wash buffer by flicking the plate and patting it dry. 100 µl of prepared working detector solution was added to each well. The ELISA plate was incubated for 1 hour at room temperature followed by seven washes, as above, and then followed by addition of 100 µl of TMB one-step substrate Reagent to each well. The ELISA plate was then incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature and then 50 µl of stop solution was added to each well. Colorimetric detection was performed at 450 nm within 10 minutes of adding stop solution on a Victor3 plate reader.
Briefly, for the AlphaLISA protocol, 5 µl of supernatant from the compound-treated assay plate was added to a 96-well half area detection plate and 20 µl of a 2.5X MIX was subsequently added to the wells. AlphaLISA anti-IL-2 acceptor beads were added to the wells at a final concentration of 10 µl/mL and biotinylated anti-IL-2 antibody was added to a final concentration of 1 nM. The detection plate was incubated for 60 minutes at 23°C and 25 µl of 2X SA-donor beads at 40 Ag/mL final concentration was added. The detection plate was incubated for 30 minutes at 23°C in the dark. Detection was carried out using the Biotek Syn4-alpha plate reader with excitation at 680 nm and emission at 570 nm.
Data was normalized to within-plate controls; 0.1%DMSO was used to represent 0% IL-2 production and 0.1 µg/ml anti-CD28 antibody was used to represent 100% IL-2 production. Dose curve analysis for EC50 values was performed using basic nonlinear regression with a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) in ActivityBase version 7.0 software (IDBS) or GraphPad Prism 5 software.

Growth inhibition assays (see Figures 1 and 8)
This protocol describes the technique to perform growth inhibition assays in 96-well format. This assay was used to calculate growth inhibition IC50 values of lenalidomide, pomalidomide, all derivatives and inhibition with CMPD31.
Cell culture and cell plating
Cell lines Jurkat, NCI-H929, and JeKo-1 were obtained from ATCC and were maintained by vendor-specified media requirements. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at 3,750 cells per well (Jeko-1, HS-Sultan) or 5,000 cell per well (NCI-H929) in 90 µL of assay growth medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% pen-strep). Cells in plates were allowed to incubate at room temperature for one hour and then transferred to an incubator set at 37°C and 5% CO2 humidified air overnight.
Compound Plate Creation
Compounds were serially diluted 3- fold in 100% DMSO into duplicate 10-point dose curves using a Biomek FX liquid handler in columns 2 through 11 of a 96-well U-bottom plate. Starting concentrations of compounds was 10 mM. Daughter plates containing 2 µL of the compound dose curves were stamped and stored at -80C. Control plates were made by stamping 2 µL of 100% DMSO into columns one and 12 rows A, B, E and F and 2 µL of 10 mM Doxorubicin in rows C, D, G and H. DMSO and Doxorubicin were used as plating controls, 100% and 0% growth respectively.
Compound addition, assay detection and analysis
Compound and control daughter plates were diluted 100-fold in 200 µl of assay growth medium and then finally diluted 10-fold more into the 96-well cell plates; a final dilution of 1000-fold in 0.1% DMSO for all wells. For the CMPD 31 growth inhibition assays, a 10X stock (100 µM) of CMPD 31 in RPMI-1640 medium was prepared and diluted into each assay well at all concentrations of lenalidomide and pomalidomide at a final concentration of 10 µM. Compound-treated plates were incubated for 120 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 and then 10 µL of Cell Titer Blue (Promega Corporation) was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in 5% CO2 and then plates were read on a Perkin Elmer Victor3 V plate reader with excitation at 560 nm and emission at 590 nm. Data was normalized to within-plate controls; 0.1 %DMSO was used to represent 100% growth and 10 µM Doxorubicin was used to represent 0% growth. Dose curve analysis for IC50 values was performed using basic nonlinear regression with a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) in ActivityBase version 7.0 software (IDBS).

Target Discovery by Standard Small Molecule Affinity Chromatography (see Figures 2-5 and 7)
Cell lysates were prepared from 2x108 Jeko-1, Jurkat, or HS-Sultan cells or 5x107 HeLa S3 cells per pulldown sample by lysis in 2 mL Buffer B (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na3VO4, 25 mM NaF, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, and 1 Complete Mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet per 10-25 mL Buffer B). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by 2x freeze-thaw using liquid N2 and 37 °C water bath in polypropylene tubes. Samples were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and pre-cleared with 10 µL control affigel reagent (affigel-ethanolamine or affigel-PEG linker) by incubation on a rotator for 30 min at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates were transferred to Mobicol 1 mL columns with 90 µm pore size frit on ice and centrifuged at 0.1 rcf for 10 sec to separate affigel beads from lysates. Incubations with pre-cleared lysates and excess pomalidomide were performed at a 20-fold excess competitor concentration (500 µM final concentration) on a rotator for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, 10 µL control or pomalidomide-based affigel reagents were added to each sample and pulldowns were performed for 1 hr at 4 °C. Lysates and affigel reagents were transferred to Mobicol 1 mL columns with 90 µm pore size frit and affigel beads were washed 3x with 800 µL Buffer B and 2x with 800 µL Buffer A (Buffer B not including 0.4% Nonidet P-40). Columns were centrifuged for 30 sec at 0.1 rcf to remove any remaining wash buffer and then closed with lower plug. Columns were placed in 1.5 mL Low-binding Eppendorf tubes and heated at 50 °C for 30 min in 40 uL 2x SDS sample buffer with 10 mM DTT to elute bound proteins from affigel reagents. Columns were then opened and eluents were collected in the low-binding Eppendorf tubes by 15 sec centrifugation at 1600 rpm. Samples were applied and resolved on 4-12% SDS-PAGE gels followed by silver staining (SilverQuest Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Bands which were competed by excess actimid competitor but not by DMSO were excised and identified by LC/MS/MS analysis at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Mass Spectrometry Core Facility (Boston, MA).

Affigel Binding to Overexpressed PRPK and TPRKB (see Figures 3-5)
C-term Myc-DDK tagged PRPK and C-term Myc-DDK tagged TPRKB proteins were transiently overexpressed from cDNAs (obtained from Origene, Rockville, MD) in HEK-293FT cells using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). One day prior to transfection, 2.5x106 HEK-293FT cells were plated per p100 dish. Cells were lysed 48 hr post-transfection in 1-2 mL Buffer B per p100 dish per sample. Pulldowns were performed as described above for standard small molecule affinity chromatography with active (pomalidomide-based) or inactive (CMPD 31-based, thalidomide-based, or acylated) affinity reagents. The amount of PRPK and TPRKB captured by each affinity reagent was determined by silver stain and anti-DDK (anti-DDK monoclonal antibody, Origene) Western blot. Competition experiments were also performed using a variety of compounds and derivatives (pomalidomide, lenalidomide, thalidomide, CMPD 31, CMPD 30, CMPD 29).
Example 15 (Reference)
Overexpression of PRPK and TPRKB in Jurkat Cells (see Figure 6)
C-term Myc-DDK tagged PRPK and C-term Myc-DDK tagged TPRKB proteins were transiently overexpressed in Jurkat cells using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche). PRPK and TPRKB cDNAs were used to transfect 5 million Jurkat cells with each cDNA alone or in combination (PRPK+TPRKB co-expression). Expression levels were assayed 48 hr post-transfection following lysis in 200 µL RIPA Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA plus 1 Complete Mini protease inhibitor and 1 PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor tablet per 10 mL RIPA Buffer). Protein levels were assessed using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and 30 µg lysate was resolved on a 4-12% SDS-PAGE gel prior to Western blot with anti-Myc Tag antibody (71D10, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) or anti-vinculin loading control (hVIN-1, Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

SILAC-Based Quantitative Affinity Chromatography (see Figure 7)
Cells were labeled and experiments were performed according to previously published protocols (Ong S and Mann M, 2006, Nature Protocols; Ong S et al, 2009, PNAS). Briefly, Jeko-1 cells were labeled with a "light" (L-Lysine, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or "heavy" (L-Lysine-13C6,15N2, Cambridge Isotope, Andover, MA) amino acid in SILAC RPMI-1640 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) supplemented with L-Arginine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 10% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Jeko-1 cells of 80-90% confluency from a T225 flask were spun down and washed 2x with PBS and seeded 1:10 into light or heavy SILAC media. Cells were subcultured at least twice and allowed to grow in SILAC media for at least five cell doublings. Cells were seeded in 1 L cell culture bags (Lampire, Pipersville, PA) in the final expansion step to obtain sufficient quantities of cells for pulldown experiments. For affinity chromatography, cell lysates were prepared from 1x109 light or heavy Jeko-1 cells per pulldown sample by lysis in 4 mL Buffer B. Pulldowns were performed as above for standard small molecule affinity chromatography with the following modifications: Lysates were pre-cleared with 25 uL control affigel-PEG linker per sample for 45 min. Competition was performed with 16-fold excess pomalidomide or CMPD 31 added to the light lysate and DMSO added to the heavy lysate. Pulldowns were performed with 25 µL pomalidomide-based affigel reagent. Following the pulldowns, light and heavy samples were washed separately 1x with 800 µL Buffer B, then light and heavy samples were pooled and added to Mobicol columns and washed 3x with 800 µL Buffer B and 3x 800 µL Buffer A. Samples were eluted in 30 µL 4x SDS sample buffer with 10 mM DTT. SILAC mass spectrometry and data analysis were performed by Dr. Steve Gygi and members of the Taplin Mass Spectrometry Facility (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA).

Treatment of PBMCs with Immunomodulatory Drugs. On the day of initial treatment, cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor (PBMCs; Astarte Biologics) were thawed in RPMI-1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin and 25 mM HEPES buffer (complete medium) at 37°C. PBMCs were centrifuged two times at 1000 rpm to remove residual DMSO and debris and counted on a haemocytometer. Cells were used at a final cell density of 1x106 cells per mL in complete medium. PBMCs were stimulated with soluble anti-CD3 antibody (BD Pharmingen, clone UCHT1) at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL and added to 96-well round bottom plates with or without lenolidomide or pomalidomide at various concentrations for 72 hours at 37°C, 5% CO2 (final DMSO concentration ≤ 0.2%). Positive control PBMCs were stimulated with IL-2 at a final concentration of 120 IU/mL (R&D systems) in the absence of anti-CD3 antibody.
DELFIA Assay for Assessment of NK lytic activity. Following the 72 hour treatment, NK cells were assayed for lytic activity using the DELFIA cell cytoxicity assay from Perkin-Elmer according to manufacturer's instructions. In brief, K562 cells were grown in complete medium. In log phase, cells were washed once with PBS containing 20 mM HEPES. K562 cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, counted on a hemacytometer and diluted to 1x106 cells per mL. BATDA ligand (5 µL) was added to 5 mL of K562 cells in a 50 mL conical tube. Following 10 minutes of incubation at 37°C, cells were washed three times in PBS containing 20 mM HEPES and 2.5 mM probenecid to prevent BATDA ligand efflux. K562 cells were resuspended in complete medium containing 2.5 mM probenecid and diluted to a final density of 5x104 cells per mL. Prior to mixing PBMC effector cells and K562 target cells, the plates containing PBMCs were spun down and resuspended in a final volume of 50 µL of fresh complete medium. PBMCs were then transferred to a separate 96-well round bottom plate to which 50 µL of K562 cells (2500 cells per well) were added (effector to target ratio of approximately 8:1). The assay plate was centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm to enhance NK-K562 conjugation and allowed to incubate at 37°C. After 2 hours of incubation, 20 µL of the supernatant was removed and transferred to a Perkin-Elmer microtitration plate. Europium solution (200 µL) was added to the supernatants and the plate was placed on a Wallac Victor microplate reader. Following a 15 minute orbital shake at high speed, the plate was read using time-resolved fluorescence (Excitation at 340 nm, Emission at 615 nm; delay 400 µsec; counting window 400 µsec, cycle 1000 µsec). Raw counts were normalized as a percent of untreated DMSO control (basal NK activity, 0%) and IL-2 (maximal NK activity, 100%). Dose curve analysis for EC50 values was performed using basic nonlinear regression with a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) in GraphPad Prism 5 software.

Cell staining and treatment. Logarithmically growing Jurkat cells from ATCC (clone E6-1) and RAMOS cells from ATCC are resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium containing 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution without serum. Additionally, an aliquot of cells is resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution to be used as an unstained control. RAMOS cells are stained with the dye DIO from Vybrant® Multicolor Cell-Labeling Kit (Invitrogen) by adding 5 µL of dye per mL of cells. Jurkat cells are stained with the dye DIL from Vybrant® Multicolor Cell-Labeling Kit (Invitrogen). Cells are stained for 10 minutes at 37°C in 5% CO2. Following staining, an equal volume of RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution and the cells are centrifuged down for 5 min at 1000 rpm. Cells are washed one time by aspirating off media and resuspending the pellet at 1 x 106 cells/mL. Media is aspirated and cells are resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL and a small aliquot is used to recount the cells and centrifuge them down once more for 5 min at 1000 rpm. The pellet is resuspended at 1 x 106 cells/mL based on the new cell count and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 until use. Then 400 µL of each cell type is removed and placed in a microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 until fixation to use as a stained control.
For each sample 400 µL of stained RAMOS cells are added to a microcentrifuge tube. Samples are treated with compounds of interest for several hours at 37°C in 5% CO2. Following treatment 400 µL of stained Jurkat cells are added to the microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. Following centrifugation 400 µL of supernatant are removed from the microcentrifuge tube and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 30 minutes. Immediately after conjugation the samples are fixed for 15 minutes at room temperature by the addition of 400 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS (Boston Bioproducts).
For a positive control, cells are treated with 2 µg/ml SEE for 1 hour then conjugated with Jurkat cells for 30 minutes. For a negative control RAMOS cells are incubated alone for 1 hour then conjugated with Jurkat cells for 30 minutes. Additional controls include unstained RAMOS and Jurkat cells and stained RAMOS and Jurkat cells for optimization of the FACS instrument.
FACS Analysis. This data acquisition protocol is optimized for use with the BD FacsCalibur flow cytometer. The flow cytometer must be properly compensated for fluorescence carry-over in the PMT detectors using the individually stained control tubes. DIO is detected in the FL-1 channel and DIL is detected in the FL-2 channel. At least 10,000 events are acquired for each sample where the flow rate does not exceed 500 events per second.
