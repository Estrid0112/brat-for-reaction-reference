Background Art
Neurodegenerative disease refers to a class of diseases caused by progressive pathological changes of nervous system, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), etc. Since the cause for the development of this class of diseases is complex, and the pathogenic mechanism is not clear yet, there is no effective therapeutic agent yet.
FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs), named for the capability of binding to immunosuppressant FK506 (tacrolimus), are important mediators for FK506 to exert immunosuppressive action, and their physiological function has not been completely identified yet. Steiner J. P. et al. found in 1992 that the concentration of FKBPs in brain and periphery was much greater than that in immunologic tissues, and it was thus conjectured that there might be a certain relationship between FKBPs and nervous system. The results obtained by Dawson et al. show that FK506 can block nerve excitotoxicity caused by activation of NMDA receptor (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor) by glutamic acid. It is supposed that this might be because after the inhibition of Calcineurin by FKBPs, the phosphorylation level of nitric oxide synthetase (NOS) increases, which inhibits the catalytic activity of NOS, thereby avoiding the injury of neurons by NO. In addition, it is found by studies that a protein closely associated with the growth of neurons-GAP43 (growth associated protein-43) is also a substrate for Calcinerin, the nerve regeneration of injured facial nerve and sciatic nerve is always accompanied by a significant increase in the mRNA level of GAP43, and meanwhile the mRNA level of FKBPs also increases correspondingly. These findings show that FKBPs may be associated with nerve growth. People are inspired by the above results and finally find organic small-molecule compounds capable of promoting nerve growth, from FKBPs ligands, and therefore FKBPs are also known as neuroimmunophilins.
Based on such an inventive concept, in 1994, Lyons et al. found by studies that immunosuppressive agent FK506 had a significant activity of promoting nerve growth in vitro, and set a precedent for research on small-molecule nerve growth promoters. Although the mechanism underlying the nerve growth promotion and protection of FKBP family ligands has not been identified completely yet, more and more studies show that FKBPs are involved in the mediation of the process. By evaluation using in vitro assays (such as chick embryonic dorsal root ganglion growth assay, PC12 cell differentiation assay and assay on oxidative damage of nerve cell lines) and multiple animal models (such as rat peripheral sciatic nerve transected model, diabetes mellitus mouse model of peripheral neurodegenerative disease, animal model of Parkinson's disease and presenile dementia animal model), the results show that some compounds, which were designed based on FKBPs structures and synthesized, had significantly nerve growth-promoting and protective function. The typical one among these compounds is GPI1485 from Guilford Pharmaceuticals Inc. The Company uses GPI1485 as a prophylactic and therapeutic drug for Parkinson's disease and apoplexy, its phase II clinical research has finished, and the phase III clinical research is ongoing. Meanwhile, a lot of highly active compounds emerges constantly, and therefore FKBPs have become an important target for drugs for preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases.
The Chinese Invention Patent ZL01142744.2 (Substituted 6-membered N-heterocyclic compounds and their uses as neurological regulator) discloses a class of FKBP ligands with new structures capable of promoting nerve regeneration, among which Compound 4 is the optimal compound. However, it is found by studies that Compound 4 has low blood-brain barrier penetration, low melting point, and is in a state of oil at room temperature and therefore is not suitable for use in the manufacture of a medicament for preventing/treating a neurodegenerative disease. The Chinese Invention Patent CN102675244 discloses its optimized compounds, however, they can be further improved with respect to the activity of promoting the growth of nerve fibers and in vivo efficacy.

Example 29 Evaluation of the neurotrophic activity of compounds
The neurotrophic activity of the compounds according to the invention can be embodied in multiple in vitro biological models, such as in vitro serum-free culture model of chick embryonic dorsal root ganglion.
Experimental method: in a sterile environment, chick embryo, which had been incubated for 8 d, had the spinal and bilateral ganglion exposed under anatomical lens. Dorsal root ganglions were picked one by one using sharp forceps, and seeded in culture bottles spread with rat tail collagen, at a density of 5-6 ganglions per bottle, and two bottles for each dose. After attachment culture in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 1 h, serum-free medium DMEM containing nerve growth factor (NGF) (0.15 ng/mL), and the compound according to the invention were added. In the control group, only the medium and the same dose of NGF were added. After culture in the incubator for 48 h, the growth of neurite around dorsal root ganglion was observed under inverted phase contrast microscope, which was scored depending on the length and density of neurite.
Evaluation criteria: 0: no neurite; 1: rare long neurite; 2: relatively long or dense neurite; 3: long and dense neurite.
Table 1 shows the scores of the growth of neurites of chick embryo dorsal root ganglion promoted by the compounds in different doses, wherein the value is the average value of five ganglions.

It can be seen from the results above that the compounds according to the invention were superior to Compound 5 in terms of neurotrophic activity, and is superior to or comparable to Compound 6 in terms of activity, for example: at the doses of 1 pM and 100 pM, Compound 20 had the neurotrophic activity increased by 25% and 30% compared to Compound 6, respectively.
In view of the structure of compounds, R1 had a significant effect on the neurotrophic activity of compounds. For example, Compound 6 and Compound 28 were the same with respect to R2 and R3, respectively, while Compound 28 had ethyl as R1, and Compound 6 had methyl as R1. At the doses of 1 pM and 100 pM, Compound 28 had the neurotrophic activity increased by 19% and 16% compared to Compound 6, respectively. Therefore, it can be seen that with the increase in the carbon number of R1, the neurotrophic activity of thiazideamide derivatives increased.
In another aspect, R2 also had a significant effect on the neurotrophic activity of compounds. For example, Compounds 24, 25 and 26 were the same as Compound 6 with respect to R1 and R3, respectively, while Compound 24 had benzyl as R2, Compound 25 and 26 had phenethyl as R2, and Compound 6 had isobutyl as R2. At the doses of 1 pM and 100 pM, Compounds 24, 25 and 26 had the neurotrophic activity increased by 4.8-12.5% and 5.1-9.8% compared to Compound 6. This indicates that with the increase in the volume and/or hydrophobicity of R2, the neurotrophic activity of thiazideamide derivatives also increased.

2.3 Incomplete global cerebral ischemia of mice and determination of the cerebral MDA content
2.3.1 Mouse bilateral carotid artery ligation: 1 h after the last administration, the mice were subjected to orbital bloodletting to reduce blood pressure (which was about 30% of the total blood volume of the mice), and then fixed in supine position on the operating table, and cut in the middle of neck. Carotid artery was subjected to blunt dissection, and 2 lines were used in ligation for each side. The time counting started after the ligation with the third line, the carotid artery was cut off between the two lines, and the incision was sewn up. In the Sham-operated group, the carotid artery was only separated without ligation. After the operation, the mice were unfixed quickly, and the mice were observed and recorded for the behaviors within 6 h (scoring depending on the following table using blind method) and the death time.

The frozen MDCK-MDR1 cells were quickly thawed in a 37 °C water bath. To the resuscitated cells, DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS was added, and the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and a relative humidity of 90%. The medium was changed every other day. After fusion of the cells growing for 1-2 days, the cells were digested with 0.25 % trypsin-EDTA (0.2 %) mixed digestion solution at 37 °C, and were sub-cultured at a certain ratio. The cells for use in experiment were those passaged for 40-60 generations.
When the cell fusion degree reached 80%, the cells were digested and then suspended in complete medium, and seeded to Millicell plate at 1×106 cells·mL-1. The medium was changed every other day, and 1 week later, the medium was changed every day. After culturing for 5 days, the resistance value reached a constant value (>200Ω·cm2), and the cells could be used in the transport experiment.
2.3 Quality control of MDCK-MDR1 cell monolayer:
2.3.1 Determination of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER)
The electrode was dipped into DMEM medium and equilibrated for 24 h, and then taken out and sterilized by dipping into 70% alcohol for 15 min. The electrode was placed at room temperature and dried in air, and then equilibrated in sterile DMEM medium for 15 min. In the experiment, the two ends of the electrode were inserted into the upper and bottom wells of 24-well Millicell culture plate sequentially to determine resistance value, for three times at random site for each well, and the resistance values were recorded. Meanwhile, the resistance value of a blank well was also determined. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was calculated in accordance with the following equation. TEER=Rt−R0×S wherein, Rt refers to a measured resistance value; R0 refers to the resistance value of a blank well; S refers to an effective film area.
2.3.2 Positive control compound:
Rhodamine 123 (Rho-123), as positive control compound, was diluted to 5 µmol·L-1 using HBSS, and the medium was removed from each well before the experiment. After washing with 37 °C HBSS twice, the cells were incubated in a 37 °C culture incubator, wherein Rho-123 was added to the upper wells, and HBSS was added to the bottom wells. The incubation was carried out in a constant temperature shaker, and the solutions from the bottom wells were collected at each time point (0 min, 30 min, 90 min, 120 min), and stored at -20 °C for further use. The amount of Rho-123 permeated to the bottom well was determined by fluorospectrophotometer, wherein the emission wavelength was 430 nm, and the excitation wavelength was 530 nm. In the experiment, the Papp value of Rho-123 was consistent with the value reported in papers.
2.4 Drug transport experiment
Before the experiment, Millicell seeded with cells was immersed in 37 °C HBSS for a suitable period of time, and Millicell was washed gently to remove the substances attached on the cell surface.
The permeability from cavity-surface to basal surface: drug-containing HBSS 0.35 mL was add to Apical (AP), and blank HBSS 1.2 mL was added to Basolateral (BL). The Millicell was placed at 37 °C in a shaker under shaking at 50 r·min-1, 50 µL sample was collected from the bottom well at 0, 30, 90, 120 min, respectively, and the same volume of blank HBSS was supplemented. 3 wells were set for each concentration, and to the sample, an internal standard solution (50 µL) and ethyl acetate (350 µL) were added precisely. The mixture was mixed homogeneously under shaking, and centrifuged at 12000 rmp for 5 min. The supernatant (300 µL) was volatilized to dryness, and re-dissolved in 50 µL acetonitrile. The 10 µL resultant solution was used for determination.
The permeability from basal surface to cavity surface: the drug is added to Basolateral (BL), and blank HBSS was added to Apical (AP), and the other steps were the same as those of the experiment for determining the permeability from cavity-surface to basal surface.
The apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of a drug reflects the ability of the drug to pass through cell monolayer and the drug absorption rate and extent. It can be calculated in accordance with the following equation: Papp=ΔQΔt⋅A⋅C0 wherein, Q represents the amount of drug permeated in the t period, A represents cell surface area, and represents the area (0.6 cm2) of supporting film in this model, and C0 represents an initial concentration. The unit of Papp is expressed as cm·s-1.
