TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel methyl menthol derivative and a cooling agent composition containing the methyl menthol derivative. Further, the present invention relates to a sensory stimulant composition containing such a cooling agent composition, and a flavor composition and/or a fragrance composition and products, each containing such a sensory stimulant composition blended therein.
BACKGROUND ART
Conventionally, a cooling agent which gives a refreshing sensation (a refresh feeling) or a cool sensation (coolness and refreshing feeling), that is, a cool feeling effect to the human skin, mouth, nose, and throat has been used in tooth pastes, confections (for example, chewing gums, candies and the like), tobaccos, poultices, cosmetics, etc. As a flavor substance and/or a fragrance substance which gives such a refresh feeling or coolness and refreshing feeling, 1-menthol has been widely used currently. However, it has disadvantages that the cool feeling effect thereof lacks persistence, and when the using amount thereof is increased, the cool feeling effect is enhanced, but bitterness sometimes accompanies.
As a compound having a cool feeling effect, other than 1-menthol, many compounds have been proposed and used. Examples of the compounds which have a cool feeling effect and have been proposed conventionally other than 1-menthol include 3-substituted-p-menthane (see, for example, PTL 1), N-substituted-p-menthane-3-carboxamide (see, for example, PTL 2 and PTL 3), 1-menthyl glucoside (see, for example, PTL 4), 3-(1-menthoxy)propan-1,2-diol (see, for example, PTL 5), l-menthyl-3-hydroxybutyrate (see, for example, PTL 6), 1-alkoxy-3-(1-menthoxy)propan-2-ol (see, for example, PTL 7), 3-hydroxymethyl-p-menthane esters (see, for example, PTL 8), N-acetylglycine menthane methyl ester (see, for example, PTL 9), l-isopulegol (see, for example, PTL 10), (2S)-3-{(1R,2S,5R)-[5-methyl-2-(1-methylethyl)cyclohexyl]oxy}-1,2-propanediol (see, for example, PTL 11), 2-hydroxymethyl menthol (see, for example, PTL 12), menthoxyalkane-1-ol (see, for example, PTL 13), (1-menthyloxyalkoxy)alkanol (see, for example, PTL 14), N-substituted-p-menthanecarboxamides (see, for example, PTL 15 and PTL 16), N-α-(menthanecarbonyl)amino acid amide (see, for example, PTL 17), and isopulegol derivatives (see, for example, PTL 18)

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
However, the above-mentioned conventionally proposed cooling agents have a certain level of cool feeling effect, but are not yet sufficiently satisfactory for persistence of the cool feeling effect or the like. In addition, also the sensory stimulating effect is needed to be further improved.
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel methyl menthol derivative which does not have unfavorable stimulation, a peculiar smell, bitterness, etc., and can be used as a cooling agent or a sensory stimulant having excellent persistence of a refresh feeling or coolness and refreshing feeling.
Further, another object of the present invention is to provide a cooling agent composition containing the novel methyl menthol derivative and a sensory stimulant composition containing the cooling agent composition.
Further, still another object of the present invention is to provide a flavor composition and/or a fragrance composition containing the sensory stimulant composition blended therein and products containing the sensory stimulant composition or the flavor composition and/or the fragrance composition blended therein.
Solution to Problem
The present inventors conducted intensive studies to achieve the above objects, and as a result, they found that a 5,5-dimethyl-2-isopropylcyclohexane derivative or a 5,5-dimethyl-2-isopropenylcyclohexane derivative, which is a methyl menthol derivative represented by the general formula (1A) or the general formula (1B), has a strong cool feeling effect, and also has excellent persistence thereof, and is useful as a cool feeling substance and further as a sensory stimulating substance. In addition, they found that, for example, in the case where 1-menthol is used as a cooling agent, the methyl menthol derivative can reduce the irritating smell of 1-menthol. Moreover, they found that in a flavor composition and/or a fragrance composition containing a sensory stimulant composition containing a cooling agent composition containing a methyl menthol derivative represented by the general formula (1A) or the general formula (1B), the top note and lingering scent of the flavor composition and/or the fragrance composition are enhanced, and also a high scent quality improving effect is imparted to products scented with the flavor composition and/or the fragrance composition, and completed the present invention based on these findings.
That is, the present invention relates to the following [1] to [17].
