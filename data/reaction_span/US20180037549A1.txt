FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
The present disclosure relates to novel, safe and efficient processes for the synthesis of Pimavanserin and salts thereof, as well as novel intermediates that can be used in these processes.
BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE
Pimavanserin tartrate, 1-(4-fluorobenzyl)-3-(4-isobutoxybenzyl)-1-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)urea L-hemi-tartrate, has the following chemical structure:
Pimavanserin tartrate was developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and was approved under the trade name NUPLAZID® for use in patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis.
Pimavanserin free base and its synthesis are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,601,740 (referred to herein as US '740 or the '740 patent) and U.S. Pat. No. 7,790,899 (referred to herein as US '899 or the '899 patent). US '740 discloses the synthesis of Pimavanserin free base (also referred to herein as “Compound A”), which includes O-alkylation followed by ester hydrolysis, and then in situ azidation. This process suffers from low process safety, and utilizes the hazardous reagent diphenylphosphoryl azide. The process is illustrated by the following Scheme 1.
US '899 describes another process, which includes O-alkylation followed by aldehyde reductive amination to obtain an intermediate which is then reacted with the hazardous reagent phosgene. This process is illustrated by the following Scheme 2:
Both of the above processes for the preparation of Pimavanserin include a reaction between 1-isobutoxy-4-(isocyanatomethyl)benzene, a benzyl isocyanate intermediate, and N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine. Processes for preparing benzyl isocyanate derivatives are generally described in the literature, such as in US '740; US '899; Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 21(11), 2960-2967, 2013; JP 2013087107; Synthesis (12), 1955-1958, 2005; and Turkish Journal of Chemistry, 31(1), 35-43, 2007. These processes often use the hazardous reagents like phosgene derivatives or diphenylphosphoryl azide.
Accordingly, there is a need for additional processes allowing the efficient and safe synthesis of Pimavanserin.

or a salt thereof, to obtain Pimavanserin or salts thereof.
The present disclosure also relates to the compound of the formula XVIII:
or of formula XIX:

Thus, another aspect of the present disclosure relates to the use of the compound of formula XVIII or the compound of formula XIX in the preparation of Pimavanserin or salts thereof.
In yet another, related aspect, the present disclosure relates to a process comprising reacting a compound of formula XVIII
wherein R1 is as defined above, with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to obtain a compound of formula XIX
and further reacting the compound of formula XIX with a compound of formula V

The processes or steps may be referred to herein as being carried out “overnight.” This refers to time intervals, e.g., for the processes or steps, that span the time during the night, when the processes or steps may not be actively observed. The time intervals are from about 8 to about 20 hours, or about 10-18 hours, or about 16 hours.
As used herein, and unless indicated otherwise, the term “reduced pressure” refers to a pressure of about 10 mbar to about 500 mbar, or about 50 mbar.
A thing, e.g., a reaction mixture, may be characterized herein as being at, or allowed to come to “room temperature” or “ambient temperature”, often abbreviated as “RT”. This means that the temperature of the thing is close to, or the same as that of the space, e.g., the room or fume hood, in which the thing is located. Typically, room temperature is from about 20° C. to about 30° C., or about 22° C. to about 27° C., or about 25° C.
The amount of solvent employed in chemical processes, e.g., reactions or crystallizations, may be referred to herein as a number of “volumes” or “vol” or “V.” For example, a material may be referred to as being suspended in 10 volumes (or 10 vol or 10V) of a solvent. In this context, this expression would be understood to mean milliliters of the solvent per gram of the material being suspended, such that suspending a 5 grams of a material in 10 volumes of a solvent means that the solvent is used in an amount of 10 milliliters of the solvent per gram of the material that is being suspended or, in this example, 50 mL of the solvent. In another context, the term “v/v” may be used to indicate the number of volumes of a solvent that are added to a liquid mixture based on the volume.

“Alkylaryl” refers to an alkyl group in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by an aryl group, wherein alkyl group and aryl group are defined supra. Alkylaryl groups can be substituted or unsubstituted. Examples include, but are not limited to, benzyl (C6H5CH2-).
“Alcohol protecting groups” refers to protecting groups which are introduced into a molecule by chemical modification of hydroxyl groups, for example to obtain chemoselectivity in a subsequent reaction. The term and use of protecting groups is well known in the art and for example described in Philipp J. Kocieński: Protecting Groups, 1. Auflage, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1994; Peter G. M. Wuts, Theodora W. Greene: Green's Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Fifth Ed. John Wiley & Sons Inc., Hoboken, N.J. Alcohol protecting groups can be for example acetoxy groups, benzoyl groups (Bz), benzyl groups (Bn), β-methoxyethoxymethyl ether (MEM), [bis-(4-methoxyphenyl)phenylmethyl] (DMT), methoxymethyl ether (MOM), [(4-methoxyphenyl)diphenylmethyl, (MMT), p-methoxybenzyl ether (PMB), methylthiomethyl ether, pivaloyl (Piv), tetrahydropyranyl (THP), triphenylmethyl (Tr), silyl ethers, trimethylsilyl ethers (TMS), triethylsilyl ethers (TES), tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers (TBDMS), tri-iso-propylsilyloxymethyl ethers (TOM), triisopropylsilyl (TIPS) ethers, methyl ethers and ethoxyethyl ethers (EE).
A solid state form, such as a crystal form or amorphous form, may be referred to herein as being characterized by graphical data “as depicted in” or “as substantially depicted in” a Figure. Such data include, for example, powder X-ray diffractograms and solid state NMR spectra. As is well-known in the art, the graphical data potentially provides additional technical information to further define the respective solid state form (a so-called “fingerprint”) which cannot necessarily be described by reference to numerical values or peak positions alone. In any event, the skilled person will understand that such graphical representations of data may be subject to small variations, e.g., in peak relative intensities and peak positions due to certain factors such as, but not limited to, variations in instrument response and variations in sample concentration and purity, which are well known to the skilled person. Nonetheless, the skilled person would readily be capable of comparing the graphical data in the Figures herein with graphical data generated for an unknown crystal form and confirm whether the two sets of graphical data are characterizing the same crystal form or two different crystal forms. A crystal form of a Pimavanserin or Pimavanserin intermediate, such as Compound 1, referred to herein as being characterized by graphical data “as depicted in” or “as substantially depicted in” a Figure will thus be understood to include any crystal forms of Pimavanserin or Pimavanserin intermediate, such as Compound 1, characterized with the graphical data having such small variations, as are well known to the skilled person, in comparison with the Figure.
As used herein, unless stated otherwise, the XRPD measurements were taken using a CuKα radiation wavelength of 1.54184 Å.
As used herein, and unless indicated otherwise, the terms “wet crystalline form” or “wet form” refer to a polymorph that was not dried using any conventional techniques to remove residual solvent. Examples for such conventional techniques can be, but not limited to, evaporation, vacuum drying, oven drying, drying under nitrogen flow etc.
As used herein, and unless indicated otherwise, the terms “dry crystalline form” or “dry form” refer to a polymorph that was dried using any conventional techniques to remove residual solvent. Examples for such conventional techniques can be, but not limited to, evaporation, vacuum drying, oven drying, drying under nitrogen flow etc.
As used herein, the term “crystalline Pimavanserin form Y”, “form alpha” or “Pimavanserin form alpha” refers to the crystalline from alpha as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,868,176.
The present disclosure provides a number of new intermediates, as well as their uses in processes for preparing Pimavanserin or salts thereof. Pimavanserin is a drug typically used for the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease psychosis.
Salts of Pimavanserin can for example be formed with an acid wherein the corresponding base is an anion. Exemplary anions include, but are not limited to tartrate, hemi-tartrate, phosphate, sulphate, nitrate, diphosphate, bicarbonate, carbonate, clavulanate, isothionate, borate, halide, nitrate, acetate, succinate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, mandelate, malate, citrate, fumarate, maleate, oleate, oxalate, ascorbate, nicotinate, benzoate, mesylate, salicylate, stearate, tannate, tosylate, valerate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluensulfonate, 2-ethane disulfonate, or naphthalenesulfonate.
Salts of Pimavanserin are preferably pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt of a compound that does not cause significant irritation to an organism to which it is administered and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. Pharmaceutical acceptable salts can be obtained by reacting Pimavanserin with inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acid (e.g., hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid), sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may also be obtained by reacting a compound with an organic acid such as aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic or sulfonic acids, for example tartaric, acetic, succinic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, nicotinic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, p-toluensulfonic, salicylic or naphthalenesulfonic acid. A particularly preferred salt of Pimavanserin is the hemi-tartrate salt as this is the currently marketed form of the drug.
The present disclosure also relates to certain compounds useful as intermediates in the synthesis of Pimavanserin. Such intermediates may employed either in their free base (or free acid) form, or in the form of their acid addition salts (in case of a basic group such as an amino group being present), or in the form of their base addition salts (in case an acidic functional group is present), with the possible choices including the examples listed above.
In a first aspect, the present disclosure relates to a process for preparing a compound of the following formula XVII.
wherein said process comprises reacting a compound of formula XI-a:
or a salt thereof, with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). R1 is a 2-methylpropan-oxy (“isobutoxy”) group or a group that can be converted into an isobutoxy group. Suitable groups that can be converted into an isobutoxy group are apparent to those of skill in the art and include, for example, a hydroxyl group, a halogen, a mesylate or triflate group, or an alcohol protecting group. In certain embodiments, R1 may be a halogen, a silyl ether or an alkoxy group. Preferably, R1 is an isobutoxy group resulting in a compound of formula VI-a:
Thus, in one embodiment, the process comprises reacting a compound of formula XI, or a salt thereof, such as a hydrochloric acid addition salt, and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (“CDI”) to give the compound of formula VI-a, or a salt thereof, as illustrated by the following Scheme 3 (exemplified with R1=isobutoxy).
This process may generally be performed in the presence of suitable organic solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylformamide (DMA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2-Me-THF), toluene or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the solvent may be DMF, acetonitrile, toluene or a mixture thereof.
Compound XVII may in some embodiments be isolated prior to the reaction with Compound V or a salt thereof, while in other embodiments, Compound XVII is used without isolation directly in the next step, i.e. in a “one-pot” reaction, with Compound V, or a salt thereof, to obtain Pimavanserin or the corresponding precursor of Pimavanserin, wherein R1 is a group that is converted into an isobutoxy group in a subsequent step.
Compounds of formula XVII, such as compound of formula VI-a, which are another aspect of the present disclosure, can be used as an intermediate in the synthesis of Pimavanserin, or salts thereof.
The intermediate compound of formula XVII may be converted to Pimavanserin or salts thereof by a process comprising reacting Compound XVII with Compound V, or a salt thereof, as illustrated by Scheme 4 (in Scheme 4 below, R1 in formula XVII is isobutoxy, i.e. compound of formula VI-a, although the same reaction can of course also be carried out with other R1 substituents that may later be converted to an isobutoxy group).
The reaction depicted in Scheme 4 can be carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as acetone at rather mild conditions (e.g. 40-50° C.). If necessary, the R1 substituent may subsequently be converted to an isobutoxy group to obtain Pimavanserin or a salt thereof.
An overview about certain processes for preparation of Pimavanserin is shown in Scheme 5 below.
Alternatively, the compound of formula XI-a, or a salt thereof, may also be reacted with 4-nitrophenyl chloroformate to yield a compound of formula Z:
wherein R1 is as defined above. This process step is illustrated in Scheme 6 (the Scheme depicts the reaction with compounds of formula XI and Y, respectively, i.e. with R1=isobutoxy, although it can of course also be carried out with other groups that may later be converted into an isobutoxy group.
This reaction may be carried out in a suitable organic solvent such as THF in the presence of a base, for example triethylamine, methylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine (“DIPEA”), 4-Dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, cesium carbonate, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the base is trimethylamine and/or the solvent is THF.
The compound of formula Z
is a useful intermediate in the synthesis of Pimavanserin or salts thereof, and thus represents another aspect of the present disclosure.
As explained before, R1 may in some embodiments be a 2-methylpropan-oxy (“isobutoxy”) group, or a group that can be converted into an isobutoxy group. Preferably, R1 is an isobutoxy group resulting in a compound of formula Y:
The use of a compound of formula Z (or Y) in the preparation of Pimavanserin or a salt thereof, such as the hemi-tartrate salt of Pimavanserin represents therefore another aspect of the disclosure.
The conversion of compound of formula Z (or compound of formula Y) to Pimavanserin (or a precursor of Pimavanserin wherein R1 is converted into an isobutoxy group in a subsequent step), or a salt thereof, may be accomplished by a process that comprises reacting Compound Z (or Y) with a compound V as illustrated by Scheme 7 below (shown with the specific example Compound Y).
The reaction may be carried out in a suitable organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, and preferably includes a base, e.g. DMAP, as described for the analogous reaction of the compound of formula XVII with the compound of formula V.
If necessary, the residue R1 may subsequently be converted to an isobutoxy group to obtain Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof. In one embodiment, the obtained Pimavanserin is further converted to the Pimavanserin hemi-tartrate salt.
In both process variants described herein above, the 4-substituted benzylamine of formula XI-a, or a salt thereof, may conveniently be prepared by converting a compound of formula XIII-a
to said compound of formula XI-a, or a salt thereof, by reductive amination via catalytic hydrogenation, e.g. with Raney Nickel, methanolic ammonia solution under hydrogen atmosphere, optionally followed by conversion into its acid addition salt (e.g. with HCl).
When R1 is isobutoxy, the starting compound of formula XIII may in turn be obtained by reacting the 4-hydroxy-substituted precursor with isobutyl bromide in the presence of a base and catalytic amounts of potassium iodide (KI) in a suitable organic solvent such as DMF.
This process as depicted below in Scheme 8 (with R1 being an isobutoxy group, yielding a compound of formula XI as a hydrochloric acid salt).
Alternatively, the compound of formula XI or XI-a may be prepared according to Scheme 9:
The present disclosure also includes the compound of formula XI as a hydrochloride salt in a crystalline form. The crystalline form, designated Form I, can be characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at about 3.9, 7.8, 11.7, 19.5 and 22.8 degrees two theta ±0.2 degrees two theta; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern as depicted in FIG. 3; and combinations of this data.
Crystalline Form I of Compound XI HCl can be further characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at 3.9, 7.8, 11.7, 19.5 and 22.8 degrees two theta ±0.2 degrees two theta and also having any one, any two, any three or more additional peaks selected from the group consisting of 15.6, 18.1, 20.5, 23.4 and 27.4 degrees two theta ±0.2 degrees two theta.
The disclosure further relates to a process which utilizes a hydroxamic acid derivative as an intermediate for producing Pimavanserin. Hydroxamic acid is known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,479,396; and reactions for the conversion of hydroxamic acid derivative to isocyanates are known from P. Dube et al. Org. Lett., Vol. 11, No. 24, 2009, 5622; or Zhao et al. Org. Process Res. Dev 2 Apr. 2015 (Web).
Thus, the present disclosure also relates to a novel N-hydroxy-2-(4-substituted)phenyl acetamide of the general formula XVIII:
wherein R1 is as defined above, i.e. a 2-methylpropan-oxy (“isobutoxy”) group or a group that can be converted into an isobutoxy group. Preferably, R1 is an isobutoxy group, and the resulting compound N-hydroxy-2-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)acetamide is referred to herein as “Compound 1”.
In yet another aspect, the present disclosure provides a compound (referred to as Compound B) of the following formula:
wherein R1 is as defined above (preferably wherein R1 is isobutoxy), and wherein R2 may be alkyl, aryl or hydrogen. Preferably, R2 is C1-C6 alkyl, such as methyl or ethyl, or phenyl, or hydrogen.
Compound B may be converted into a compound of formula XVIII. In some embodiments Compound B is reacted with hydroxylamine or hydroxylamine hydrochloride, in the presence of CDI, and a suitable solvent. In certain embodiments, R1 is isobutoxy and R2 is hydrogen.
Preferably, the solvent is an organic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or methyl-tetrahydrofuran (Me-THF), or mixtures thereof. Most preferably, the solvent is acetonitrile.
Alternatively, the compound of formula XVIII, such as Compound 1, can be prepared by hydroxylamination of methyl 2-(4-substituted phenyl)acetate. This reaction may be performed in the presence of hydroxylamine or hydroxylamine hydrochloride. In some embodiments, the hydroxylamination is performed in the presence of a base. Preferably the base is an inorganic base, such as sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or a mixture thereof and in the presence of a solvent. Preferably the solvent is an organic solvent, such as methanol, DMF, THF or Me-THF or a mixture thereof. Most preferably, the solvent is methanol.
The present inventors found that the compound of formula XVIII, such as Compound 1, is a useful intermediate for making Pimavanserin or a salt thereof. Hence, the use of Compound XVIII (or Compound 1) in the preparation of Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof represents another aspect of the present disclosure.
In the process of preparing Pimavanserin, Compound XVIII can be used either in an isolated form or prepared in situ, i.e. in a one-pot reaction. When used in isolated form, it may be in a crystalline form.
Accordingly, the present disclosure also includes Compound 1 (Compound XVIII with R1 being isobutoxy-) in a crystalline form, designated form I, characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at about 4.0, 11.9, 16.8, 17.7 and 19.8° 2θ±0.2° 2θ; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern as depicted in FIG. 1; and combinations of this data.
Crystalline form I of Compound 1 may be further characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at 4.0, 11.9, 16.8, 17.7 and 19.8° 2θ±0.2° 2θ and also having any one, any two, any three additional peaks selected from 7.9, 15.8 and 23.0° 2θ±0.2° 2θ.
Crystalline form I of Compound 1 may be characterized by each of the above characteristics alone and/or by all possible combinations.
Compound 1 in another crystalline form, designated form II, is another embodiment and can be characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at about 3.9, 7.8, 11.6, 15.5 and 23.4° 2θ±0.2° 2θ; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern as depicted in FIG. 2; and combinations of this data.
Crystalline form II of Compound 1 can be further characterized by an X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at 3.9, 7.8, 11.6, 15.5 and 23.4° 2θ±0.2° 2θ and also having any one, any two, any three or more additional peaks selected from 16.4, 20.7, 22.5, 26.5 and 31.7° 2θ±0.2° 2θ.
Crystalline form II of Compound 1 may be characterized by each of the above characteristics alone and/or by all possible combinations.
The compound of formula XVIII (such as Compound 1) can be converted to Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof, by reacting it with CDI to obtain an intermediate of formula XIX (as shown below) which is then converted to Pimavanserin (or the respective derivative where R1 is only converted to isobutoxy in a subsequent step), or a salt thereof.
This process can be illustrated by the following Scheme 10 (Compound 1 is shown as an illustrative example):
Thus, in certain embodiments, the process comprisesa) reacting a compound of formula XVIII, such as Compound 1, with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) to obtain 3-(4-substituted benzyl)-1,4,2-dioxazol-5-one (referred to herein as a compound of formula XIX); andb) reacting the obtained compound of formula XIX with Compound V or a salt thereof (e.g. the dihydrochloride salt) to obtain Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof.
In certain embodiments, step a) is performed in the presence of a solvent. Suitable solvents include for example acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or methyl-tetrahydrofuran (Me-THF), or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the solvent is acetonitrile.
The above reaction may be performed at a temperature of from about 20° C. to about 80° C. Preferably, the temperature is about 50° C. to about 70° C. More preferably, the temperature is about 60° C. to about 65° C.
As can be seen from Scheme 10 above, the reaction of the compound of formula XVIII with CDI proceeds via the intermediate of formula XIX (5-([4-substituted]benzyl)-1,3,4-dioxazol-2-one):
The intermediate of formula XIX as well as the process for preparing it by reacting the compound of formula XVIII with CDI thus represent further aspect of the disclosure.
As detailed above, R1 may be a 2-methylpropan-oxy (“isobutoxy”) group or a group that can be converted into an isobutoxy group. In embodiments where R1 is an isobutoxy group, the compound of formula XIX is referred to herein as Compound 2 (5-((4-isobutoxy)-benzyl)-1,3,4-dioxazol-2-one):
The intermediate of formula XIX (such as Compound 2) can be used in the preparation of Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof, which therefore represents yet another aspect of the present disclosure.
In the process going through the intermediate of formula XIX/Compound 2 (typically starting form a compound of formula XVIII such as the specific Compound 1), the intermediate may be isolated before reacting it with the compound of formula V.
Alternatively, the reaction is performed without the isolation of the intermediate of formula XIX/Compound 2, i.e. as a one-pot reaction.
Compound V can be prepared according to US '740, or, alternatively, by reacting 4-fluorobenzaldehyde (referred to herein as compound of formula III) and 1-methylpiperidin-4-amine (referred to herein as compound of formula IV) in the presence of a reducing agent, as illustrated by Scheme 11:
This process represents another aspect of the present disclosure. In certain embodiments, the processes for preparing Pimavanserin, or a salt thereof include the step of preparing compound of formula V via the compounds of formula III and IV.
The isobutoxy substituent in position R1 present in many compounds disclosed herein can for example be created by reacting (an optionally protected/derivatized) phenolic hydroxyl group with an alkylation agent, for example, 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, 1-iodo-2-methylpropane, or 1-chloro-2-methylpropane. Preferably, the alkylation agent for this reaction step is 1-bromo-2-methylpropane. The alkylation may be performed in the presence of a base. Preferably, the base is an inorganic base. More preferably, the base is potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, or cesium carbonate, or a mixture thereof. Most preferably, the base is potassium carbonate. In other embodiments, this reaction may be performed in the presence of a solvent. Preferably, the solvent is a polar solvent. More preferably, the solvent is dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide (DMA) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Most preferably, the solvent is DMF.
In the processes for preparing Pimavanserin as described herein, Pimavanserin may be obtained in a crystalline form.
In a specific embodiment, the present disclosure includes crystalline Pimavanserin designated form X, characterized by data selected from one or more of the following: X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at about 5.1, 5.4, 9.1, 9.7 and 16.6° 2θ±0.2° 2θ; an X-ray powder diffraction pattern as depicted in FIG. 3; and combinations of this data.
Crystalline Pimavanserin form X may be further characterized by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern having peaks at 5.1, 5.4, 9.1, 9.7 and 16.6° 2θ±0.2° 2θ and also having any one, any two, any three additional peaks selected from 17.8, 18.2, 18.6, 20.2 and 21.5° 2θ±0.2° 2θ.
Crystalline Pimavanserin form X may be characterized by each of the above characteristics alone and/or by all possible combinations. Form X may for example be obtained according to the procedure outlined in Example 35.
In some embodiments, the obtained Pimavanserin may be further converted to a salt, preferably, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. For example, Pimavanserin may be converted to its hemi-tartrate salt. The conversion can be done either directly, i.e. in a one-pot manner, or with isolation of Pimavanserin prior to the conversion into the respective salt.
The present disclosure also describes the use of tetraalkylammonium isocyanate in the preparation of Pimavanserin and salts thereof.
These processes comprise reacting said tetraalkylammonium isocyanate with (4-isobutoxyphenyl)methanol in the presence of 2,4,6-trichloro[1,3,5]triazine to obtain 1-isobutoxy-4-(isocyanatomethyl)benzene (referred to as Compound XVI). This step can be illustrated by Scheme 12.
In this scheme, R1, R2, R3 and R4 can be the same or different, and, independently, may be an alkyl, aryl or alkyl-aryl. In certain embodiments, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are, independently, alkyl. In other embodiments, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are, independently, C1-C6 alkyl. In further embodiments, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are, independently, C4 alkyl. In still further embodiments, R1, R2, R3, and R4 are, independently, n-butyl.
Compound XVI can then be converted to Pimavanserin by reacting it with N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine (compound of formula V), as shown in Scheme 13.
An overview about synthetic routes to Pimavanserin via Compound XVI is shown in the following Scheme 14:
In this scheme, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are as defined above, with compound (A) being Pimavanserin.
Further described herein is a compound of formula VI:
The compound of formula VI may be employed as a useful intermediate in the synthesis of Pimavanserin or a salt thereof. Such a process involves reacting the compound of formula VI with a compound of formula XI-a
wherein R1 is a 2-methylpropan-oxy (“isobutoxy”) group or a group that can be converted into an isobutoxy group, to obtain Pimavanserin or a salt thereof. Preferably, R1 is isobutoxy (referred herein as a compound of formula XI).
Moreover, the compound of formula XI-a (such as XI) may be first converted to a salt, such as a hydrochloric acid addition salt, before reacting it with Compound VI.
This process is illustrated in Scheme 15:
The compound of formula VI itself may be prepared by a process comprising reacting N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine (Compound of formula V) and 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (“CDI”), as illustrated by Scheme 16 below.
