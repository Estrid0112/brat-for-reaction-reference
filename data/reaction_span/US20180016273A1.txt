The present invention relates to novel 2-(het)aryl-substituted fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives of the formula (I), to the use thereof as acaricides and/or insecticides for controlling animal pests, particularly arthropods and especially insects and arachnids, and to processes and intermediates for preparation thereof.
2-(Het)aryl-substituted fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives having insecticidal properties have already been described in the literature, for example in WO 2010/125985, WO 2012/074135, WO 2012/086848, WO 2013/018928, WO 2014/142292 and WO 2014/148451, and also WO 2015/000715, WO 2015/121136 and WO 2015/002211.
However, the active compounds already known according to the documents cited above have some disadvantages on application, whether because they exhibit only a narrow range of application or because they do not have satisfactory insecticidal or acaricidal activity.
Novel 2-(het)aryl-substituted fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives have now been found, and these have advantages over the compounds already known, examples of which are better biological or environmental properties, a wider range of application methods, better insecticidal or acaricidal activity, and also good compatibility with crop plants. The 2-(het)aryl-substituted fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives can be used in combination with further agents for improving efficacy, especially against insects that are difficult to control.
The present invention therefore provides novel compounds of the formula (I)

The compounds of the formula (I) can optionally, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides, safeners, growth regulators or agents to improve plant properties, as microbicides or gametocides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics, bactericides, virucides (including agents against viroids) or as agents against MLO (mycoplasma-like organisms) and RLO (rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.
Formulations
The present invention further relates to formulations and use forms prepared therefrom as pesticides, for example drench, drip and spray liquors, comprising at least one compound of the formula (I). In some cases, the use forms comprise further pesticides and/or adjuvants which improve action, such as penetrants, e.g. vegetable oils, for example rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, mineral oils, for example paraffin oils, alkyl esters of vegetable fatty acids, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, or alkanol alkoxylates and/or spreaders, for example alkylsiloxanes and/or salts, for example organic or inorganic ammonium or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate and/or retention promoters, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate or hydroxypropylguar polymers and/or humectants, for example glycerol and/or fertilizers, for example ammonium-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilizers.
Customary formulations are, for example, water-soluble liquids (SL), emulsion concentrates (EC), emulsions in water (EW), suspension concentrates (SC, SE, FS, OD), water-dispersible granules (WG), granules (GR) and capsule concentrates (CS); these and further possible formulation types are described, for example, by Crop Life International and in Pesticide Specifications, Manual on development and use of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, FAO Plant Production and Protection Papers-173, prepared by the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications, 2004, ISBN: 9251048576. The formulations, in addition to one or more compounds of the formula (I), optionally comprise further agrochemically active compounds.
Preference is given to formulations or use forms comprising auxiliaries, for example extenders, solvents, spontaneity promoters, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, frost protection agents, biocides, thickeners and/or further auxiliaries, for example adjuvants. An adjuvant in this context is a component which enhances the biological effect of the formulation, without the component itself having any biological effect. Examples of adjuvants are agents which promote retention, spreading, attachment to the leaf surface or penetration.
These formulations are prepared in a known way, for example by mixing the compounds of the formula (I) with auxiliaries such as, for example, extenders, solvents and/or solid carriers and/or other auxiliaries such as, for example, surfactants. The formulations are produced either in suitable facilities or else before or during application.
The auxiliaries used may be substances suitable for imparting special properties, such as certain physical, technical and/or biological properties, to the formulation of the compounds of the formula (I), or to the use forms prepared from these formulations (for example ready-to-use pesticides such as spray liquors or seed dressing products).
Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide).
If the extender utilized is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Useful liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.
In principle, it is possible to use all suitable solvents. Examples of suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, chloroethylene or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, paraffins, mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.
In principle, it is possible to use all suitable carriers. Useful carriers especially include: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes and/or solid fertilizers. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of such carriers. Useful carriers for granules include: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic flours, and also granules of organic material such as sawdust, paper, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks.
It is also possible to use liquefied gaseous extenders or solvents. Especially suitable are those extenders or carriers which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Examples of emulsifiers and/or foam formers, dispersants or wetting agents having ionic or nonionic properties or mixtures of these surface-active substances are salts of polyacrylic acid, salts of lignosulphonic acid, salts of phenolsulphonic acid or naphthalenesulphonic acid, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, with substituted phenols (preferably alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic esters, taurine derivatives (preferably alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the compounds containing sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, protein hydrolysates, lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The presence of a surfactant is advantageous if one of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and when the application takes place in water.
Further auxiliaries which may be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom are dyes such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and nutrients and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.
Additional components may be stabilizers, such as cold stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers, or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability. Foam generators or antifoams may also be present.
In addition, the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom may also comprise, as additional auxiliaries, stickers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids. Further auxiliaries may be mineral and vegetable oils.
It is possible if appropriate for still further auxiliaries to be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Examples of such additives are fragrances, protective colloids, binders, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrants, retention promoters, stabilizers, sequestrants, complexing agents, humectants, spreaders. In general, the compounds of the formula (I) can be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for formulation purposes.
Useful retention promoters include all those substances which reduce dynamic surface tension, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate, or increase viscoelasticity, for example hydroxypropylguar polymers.
Suitable penetrants in the present context are all those substances which are usually used for improving the penetration of agrochemical active compounds into plants. Penetrants are defined in this context by their ability to penetrate from the (generally aqueous) application liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle of the plant and hence increase the mobility of the active compounds in the cuticle. The method described in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-152) can be used for determining this property. Examples include alcohol alkoxylates such as coconut fatty ethoxylate (10) or isotridecyl ethoxylate (12), fatty acid esters, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, fatty amine alkoxylates, for example tallowamine ethoxylate (15), or ammonium and/or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate.
The formulations preferably comprise between 0.00000001% and 98% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), more preferably between 0.01% and 95% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), most preferably between 0.5% and 90% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), based on the weight of the formulation.
The content of the compound of the formula (I) in the use forms prepared from the formulations (in particular pesticides) may vary within wide ranges. The concentration of the compound of the formula (I) in the use forms may typically be between 0.00000001% and 95% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), preferably between 0.00001% and 1% by weight, based on the weight of the use form. Application is accomplished in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.
Mixtures
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be used in a mixture with one or more suitable fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, molluscicides, nematicides, insecticides, microbiological agents, beneficial organisms, herbicides, fertilizers, bird repellents, phytotonics, sterilants, safeners, semiochemicals and/or plant growth regulators, in order thus, for example, to broaden the spectrum of action, prolong the period of action, enhance the rate of action, prevent repellency or prevent evolution of resistance. In addition, active compound combinations of this kind can improve plant growth and/or tolerance to abiotic factors, for example high or low temperatures, to drought or to elevated water content or soil salinity. It is also possible to improve flowering and fruiting performance, optimize germination capacity and root development, facilitate harvesting and improve yields, influence maturation, improve the quality and/or the nutritional value of the harvested products, prolong storage life and/or improve the processability of the harvested products.
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) may be present in a mixture with other active compounds or semiochemicals such as attractants and/or bird repellents and/or plant activators and/or growth regulators and/or fertilizers. Likewise, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used in mixtures with agents to improve plant properties, for example growth, yield and quality of the harvested material.
In a particular embodiment according to the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) are present in formulations or in the use forms prepared from these formulations in a mixture with further compounds, preferably those as described below.
If one of the compounds mentioned below can occur in different tautomeric forms, these forms are also included even if not explicitly mentioned in each case.

Plants and Plant Parts
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are understood here to mean all plants and populations of plants, such as desirable and undesirable wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants), for example cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetable, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape, and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines).
Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which are protectable or non-protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts shall be understood to mean all parts and organs of the plants above and below ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples given being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, slips and seeds.
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the compounds of the formula (I) is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and parts thereof in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” has been explained above. Particular preference is given in accordance with the invention to treating plants of the respective commercially customary plant cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants having new properties (“traits”) and which have been grown by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, varieties, biotypes or genotypes.
Transgenic Plants, Seed Treatment and Integration Events
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated in accordance with the invention include all plants which, through the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particular advantageous useful properties (“traits”) to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to levels of water or soil salinity, enhanced flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage life and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as insects, arachnids, nematodes, mites, slugs and snails owing, for example, to toxins formed in the plants, in particular those produced in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations thereof), and also increased resistance of the plants against phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses caused, for example, by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosates or phosphinothricin (for example the “PAT” gene). The genes which impart the desired properties (“traits”) in question may also be present in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of transgenic plants include the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetable, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapevines), particular emphasis being given to maize, soya beans, wheat, rice, potatoes, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco and oilseed rape. Properties (“traits”) which are particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of the plants to insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails.
Crop Protection-Types of Treatment
The plants and plant parts are treated with the compounds of the formula (I) directly or by action on their surroundings, habitat or storage space using customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, broadcasting, foaming, painting, spreading-on, injecting, watering (drenching), drip irrigating and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, additionally by dry seed treatment, liquid seed treatment, slurry treatment, by incrusting, by coating with one or more coats, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the compounds of the formula (I) by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the application form or the compound of the formula (I) itself into the soil.
A preferred direct treatment of the plants is foliar application, i.e. compounds of the formula (I) are applied to the foliage, where treatment frequency and the application rate should be adjusted according to the level of infestation with the pest in question.
In the case of systemically active compounds, the compounds of the formula (I) also access the plants via the root system. The plants are then treated by the action of the compounds of the formula (I) on the habitat of the plant. This can be accomplished, for example, by drenching, or by mixing into the soil or the nutrient solution, meaning that the locus of the plant (e.g. soil or hydroponic systems) is impregnated with a liquid form of the compounds of the formula (I), or by soil application, meaning that the compounds of the formula (I) are introduced in solid form (e.g. in the form of granules) into the locus of the plants. In the case of paddy rice crops, this can also be accomplished by metering the compound of the formula (I) in a solid application form (for example as granules) into a flooded paddy field.
Seed Treatment
The control of animal pests by the treatment of the seed of plants has long been known and is the subject of constant improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with, or at least reduce considerably, the additional application of pesticides during storage, after sowing or after emergence of the plants. It is additionally desirable to optimize the amount of active compound used so as to provide optimum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by animal pests, but without damage to the plant itself by the active compound used. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take account of the intrinsic insecticidal or nematicidal properties of pest-resistant or -tolerant transgenic plants in order to achieve optimal protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum expenditure of pesticides.
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants, from attack by pests, by treating the seed with one of the compounds of the formula (I). The method according to the invention for protecting seed and germinating plants against attack by pests further comprises a method in which the seed is treated simultaneously in one operation or sequentially with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. It also comprises a method where the seed is treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component.
The invention likewise relates to the use of the compounds of the formula (I) for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the resulting plant from animal pests.
The invention further relates to seed which has been treated with a compound of the formula (I) for protection from animal pests. The invention also relates to seed which has been treated simultaneously with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. The invention further relates to seed which has been treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. In the case of seed which has been treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component, the individual substances may be present on the seed in different layers. In this case, the layers comprising a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component may optionally be separated by an intermediate layer. The invention also relates to seed in which a compound of the formula (I) and mixing component have been applied as part of a coating or as a further layer or further layers in addition to a coating.
The invention further relates to seed which, after the treatment with a compound of the formula (I), is subjected to a film-coating process to prevent dust abrasion on the seed.
One of the advantages encountered with a systemically acting compound of the formula (I) is the fact that, by treating the seed, not only the seed itself but also the plants resulting therefrom are, after emergence, protected against animal pests. In this way, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.
A further advantage is that the treatment of the seed with a compound of the formula (I) can enhance germination and emergence of the treated seed.
It is likewise considered to be advantageous that compounds of the formula (I) can especially also be used for transgenic seed.
Furthermore, compounds of the formula (I) can be employed in combination with compositions of signalling technology, leading to better colonization by symbionts such as, for example, rhizobia, mycorrhizae and/or endophytic bacteria or fungi, and/or to optimized nitrogen fixation.
The compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for protection of seed of any plant variety which is used in agriculture, in greenhouses, in forests or in horticulture. More particularly, this includes seed of cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflowers, coffee, tobacco, canola, oilseed rape, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanuts, vegetables (for example tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, cruciferous vegetables, onions and lettuce), fruit plants, lawns and ornamental plants. Of particular significance is the treatment of the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye and oats), maize, soya beans, cotton, canola, oilseed rape and rice.
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with a compound of the formula (I) is also of particular importance. This involves the seed of plants which generally contain at least one heterologous gene which controls the expression of a polypeptide having insecticidal and/or nematicidal properties in particular. The heterologous genes in transgenic seed may originate from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed containing at least one heterologous gene originating from Bacillus sp. The heterologous gene is more preferably derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.
In the context of the present invention, the compound of the formula (I) is applied to the seed. The seed is preferably treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. Thus, for example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content which allows storage. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, has been treated with, for example, water and then dried again, for example priming. In the case of rice seed, it is also possible to use seed which has been imbibed in water up to a certain stage (pigeon breast stage) for example, which leads to improved germination and more uniform emergence.
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the compound of the formula (I) applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This has to be ensured particularly in the case of active compounds which can exhibit phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.
In general, the compounds of the formula (I) are applied to the seed in a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and processes for seed treatment are known to the person skilled in the art.
The compounds of the formula (I) can be converted to the customary seed-dressing formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, slurries or other coating compositions for seed, and also ULV formulations.
These formulations are produced in a known manner, by mixing compounds of the formula (I) with customary additives, for example customary extenders and solvents or diluents, dyes, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, preservatives, secondary thickeners, stickers, gibberellins and also water.
Colorants which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all colorants which are customary for such purposes. It is possible to use either pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, or dyes, which are soluble in water. Examples include the dyes known by the names Rhodamine B, C.I. Pigment Red 112 and C.I. Solvent Red 1.
Useful wetting agents which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which promote wetting and which are customary for the formulation of active agrochemical compounds. Preference is given to using alkyl naphthalenesulphonates, such as diisopropyl or diisobutyl naphthalenesulphonates.
Suitable dispersants and/or emulsifiers which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all nonionic, anionic and cationic dispersants customary for the formulation of active agrochemical compounds. Preference is given to using nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants. Suitable nonionic dispersants include in particular ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristyrylphenol polyglycol ethers, and the phosphated or sulphated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are especially lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate-formaldehyde condensates.
Antifoams which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all foam-inhibiting substances conventionally used for the formulation of active agrochemical compounds. Silicone antifoams and magnesium stearate can be used with preference.
Preservatives which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Examples include dichlorophene and benzyl alcohol hemiformal.
Secondary thickeners which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which can be used for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Preferred examples include cellulose derivatives, acrylic acid derivatives, xanthan, modified clays and finely divided silica.
Useful adhesives which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all customary binders usable in seed dressing products. Preferred examples include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose.
Gibberellins which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are preferably the gibberellins A1, A3 (=gibberellic acid), A4 and A7; particular preference is given to using gibberellic acid. The gibberellins are known (cf. R. Wegler “Chemie der Pflanzenschutz-und Schadlingsbekaimpfungsmittel”, vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, pp. 401-412).
The seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be used to treat a wide variety of different kinds of seed, either directly or after prior dilution with water. For instance, the concentrates or the preparations obtainable therefrom by dilution with water can be used to dress the seed of cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and triticale, and also the seed of maize, rice, oilseed rape, peas, beans, cotton, sunflowers, soya beans and beets, or else a wide variety of different vegetable seed. The seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the dilute use forms thereof, can also be used to dress seed of transgenic plants.
For the treatment of seed with the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or use forms prepared therefrom, all mixing units usable customarily for the seed dressing are useful. Specifically, the procedure in seed dressing is to place the seed into a mixer in batchwise or continuous operation, to add the particular desired amount of seed dressing formulations, either as such or after prior dilution with water, and to mix until the formulation is distributed homogeneously on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying operation.
The application rate of the seed dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular content of the compounds of the formula (I) in the formulations and by the seed. The application rates of the compound of the formula (I) are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 15 g per kilogram of seed.
Animal Health
In the animal health field, i.e. the field of veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula (I) are active against animal parasites, in particular ectoparasites or endoparasites. The term “endoparasites” includes especially helminths and protozoa, such as coccidia. Ectoparasites are typically and preferably arthropods, especially insects and acarids.
In the field of veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula (I) having favourable homeotherm toxicity are suitable for controlling parasites which occur in animal breeding and animal husbandry in livestock, breeding animals, zoo animals, laboratory animals, experimental animals and domestic animals. They are active against all or specific stages of development of the parasites.
Agricultural livestock include, for example, mammals such as sheep, goats, horses, donkeys, camels, buffalo, rabbits, reindeer, fallow deer, and particularly cattle and pigs; poultry such as turkeys, ducks, geese, and particularly chickens; fish and crustaceans, for example in aquaculture, and also insects such as bees.
Domestic animals include, for example, mammals, such as hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, mice, chinchillas, ferrets, and particularly dogs, cats, caged birds, reptiles, amphibians and aquarium fish.
In a preferred embodiment, the compounds of the formula (I) are administered to mammals.
In another preferred embodiment, the compounds of the formula (I) are administered to birds, namely caged birds and particularly poultry.
Use of the compounds of the formula (I) for the control of animal parasites is intended to reduce or prevent illness, cases of death and reductions in performance (in the case of meat, milk, wool, hides, eggs, honey and the like), such that more economical and simpler animal husbandry is enabled and better animal well-being is achievable.
In relation to the field of animal health, the term “control” or “controlling” means that the compounds of the formula (I) are effective in reducing the incidence of the particular parasite in an animal infected with such parasites to an innocuous degree. More specifically, “controlling” in the present context means that the compound of the formula (I) can kill the respective parasite, inhibit its growth, or inhibit its proliferation.

In the context of the present invention, a vector is an arthropod, especially an insect or arachnid, capable of transmitting pathogens, for example viruses, worms, single-cell organisms and bacteria, from a reservoir (plant, animal, human, etc.) to a host. The pathogens can be transmitted either mechanically (for example trachoma by non-stinging flies) to a host or after injection (for example malaria parasites by mosquitoes) into a host.
Examples of vectors and the diseases or pathogens they transmit are:
1) Mosquitoes
Anopheles: malaria, filariasis;Culex: Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, other viral diseases, transmission of worms;Aedes: yellow fever, dengue fever, filariasis, other viral diseases;Simulidae: transmission of worms, in particular Onchocerca volvulus; 2) Lice: skin infections, epidemic typhus;3) Fleas: plague, endemic typhus;4) Flies: sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis); cholera, other bacterial diseases;5) Mites: acariosis, epidemic typhus, rickettsialpox, tularaemia, Saint Louis encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, borreliosis;6) Ticks: borellioses such as Borrelia duttoni, tick-borne encephalitis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), babesioses (Babesia canis canis).
Examples of vectors in the context of the present invention are insects, such as aphids, flies, leafhoppers or thrips, which can transmit plant viruses to plants. Other vectors capable of transmitting plant viruses are spider mites, lice, beetles and nematodes.
Further examples of vectors in the context of the present invention are insects and arachnids such as mosquitoes, especially of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, for example A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, A. funestus, A. dirus (malaria) and Culex, lice, fleas, flies, mites and ticks, which can transmit pathogens to animals and/or humans.
Vector control is also possible if the compounds of the formula (I) are resistance-breaking.
Compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for use in the prevention of diseases and/or pathogens transmitted by vectors. Thus, a further aspect of the present invention is the use of compounds of the formula (I) for vector control, for example in agriculture, in horticulture, in forestry, in gardens and in leisure facilities, and also in the protection of materials and stored products.
Protection of Industrial Materials
The compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for protecting industrial materials against attack or destruction by insects, for example from the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera and Zygentoma.
Industrial materials in the present context are understood to mean inanimate materials, such as preferably plastics, adhesives, sizes, papers and cards, leather, wood, processed wood products and coating compositions. The use of the invention for protection of wood is particularly preferred.

In a further embodiment, the compounds of the formula (I) are present as a ready-to-use pesticide, i.e. it can be applied to the material in question without further modifications. Suitable further insecticides or fungicides are in particular those mentioned above.
Surprisingly, it has also been found that the compounds of the formula (I) can be employed for protecting objects which come into contact with saltwater or brackish water, in particular hulls, screens, nets, buildings, moorings and signalling systems, against fouling. It is equally possible to use the compounds of the formula (I), alone or in combinations with other active compounds, as antifouling agents.
Control of Animal Pests in the Hygiene Sector
The compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for controlling animal pests in the hygiene sector. More particularly, the invention can be used in the domestic protection sector, in the hygiene protection sector and in the protection of stored products, particularly for control of insects, arachnids and mites encountered in enclosed spaces, for example dwellings, factory halls, offices, vehicle cabins. For controlling animal pests, the compounds of the formula (I) are used alone or in combination with other active compounds and/or auxiliaries. They are preferably used in domestic insecticide products. The compounds of the formula (I) are effective against sensitive and resistant species, and against all developmental stages.
These pests include, for example, pests from the class Arachnida, from the orders Scorpiones, Araneae and Opiliones, from the classes Chilopoda and Diplopoda, from the class Insecta the order Blattodea, from the orders Coleoptera, Dermaptera, Diptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, Lepidoptera, Phthiraptera, Psocoptera, Saltatoria or Orthoptera, Siphonaptera and Zygentoma and from the class Malacostraca the order Isopoda.

where the bond to the remainder of the molecule is identified by a wavy line.
The log P values are measured according to EEC Directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) on a reversed-phase column (C18). Temperature: 55° C.
The LC-MS determination in the acidic range is effected at pH 2.7 using 0.1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile (contains 0.1% formic acid) as eluents, linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 95% acetonitrile. Called log P (HCOOH) in the table.
LC-MS determination in the neutral range is effected at pH 7.8 with 0.001 molar aqueous ammonium hydrogencarbonate solution and acetonitrile as eluents; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 95% acetonitrile. Called log P (neutral) in the table.
Calibration is carried out using unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon atoms) with known log P values (log P values determined on the basis of the retention times by linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).
The NMR data of selected examples are listed either in conventional form (6 values, multiplet splitting, number of hydrogen atoms) or as NMR peak lists.
In each case, the solvent in which the NMR spectrum is recorded is stated.
NMR Peak List Method
The 1H NMR data of selected examples are stated in the form of 1H NMR peak lists. For each signal peak, first the δ value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The pairs of δ value-signal intensity numbers for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons.
The peak list for one example therefore has the form of:
δ1 (intensity1); δ2 (intensity2); . . . ; δi (intensityi); . . . ; δn (intensityn)
The intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of an NMR spectrum in cm and shows the true ratios of the signal intensities. In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.
Calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra is accomplished using tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra which are measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.
The lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H-NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation.
In addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds which likewise form part of the subject-matter of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.
In the reporting of compound signals within the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the standard solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.
The peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average than the peaks of the target compounds (for example with a purity of >90%).
Such stereoisomers and/or impurities may be typical of the particular preparation process. Their peaks can thus help in this case to identify reproduction of our preparation process with reference to “by-product fingerprints”.
An expert calculating the peaks of the target compounds by known methods (MestreC, ACD simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expected values) can, if required, isolate the peaks of the target compounds, optionally using additional intensity filters. This isolation would be similar to the peak picking in question in conventional 1H NMR interpretation.
Further details of 1H NMR peak lists can be found in the Research Disclosure Database Number 564025.
