After the inoculation, all of the kidney beans were left to stand under high humidity condition only at night. Four days after the inoculation, the area of the lesion was investigated by observing the area of the lesion. As a result, the area of the lesion on the plant treated with the present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 was 30% or less than those on untreated plant.
Test Example 5
Plastic pots each were filled with soil, and wheat (cultivar: Apogee) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 10 days. To the formulated present Compound 1, 3, 4, 5 or 8 according to Formulation Example 6, water was added so as to adjust the water dilution to a predetermined concentration (500 ppm), and the adjusted dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the wheat so that the liquid sufficiently adhered to surfaces of the leaves of the wheat. After being sprayed, the plant was air-dried. After 4 days, an aqueous suspension containing spores of wheat speckled leaf blotch fungus (Septoria tritici) was sprayed to inoculate the spores. After completion of the inoculation, the plant was left to stand at 18° C. under high humidity condition for 3 days and left to stand under illumination for 14 to 18 days, and then the area of the lesion was investigated by observing the area of the lesion. As a result, the area of the lesion on the plant treated with the present Compound 1, 3, 4, 5 or 8 were 30% or less than those on untreated plant.
Meanwhile, in the same test using methyl N-(2-{[2-methyl-4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenoxy]methyl}phenyl)-N-methoxy carbamate in place of the present Compounds, the result was 70% or more than the treated wheat.
Test Example 6
Plastic pots each were filled with soil, and cucumber (cultivar: Sagami Hanjiro) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 12 days. To the formulated present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 according to Formulation Example 6, water was added so as to adjust the water dilution to a predetermined concentration (500 ppm), and the adjusted dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the cucumber so that the liquid sufficiently adhered to surfaces of the leaves of the cucumber. After being sprayed, the plant was air-dried, and then inoculated by being sprinkled with spores of cucumber powdery mildew fungus (Sphaerotheca fuliginea, a QoI-resistant strain in which, among the genes encoding cytochrome b, the amino acid residue at position 143 of cytochrome b was mutated from glycine to alanine). After the inoculation, the plant was cultivated in a greenhouse at 24° C. in the daytime and 20° C. at night for 8 days, and then the area of the lesion was investigated by observing the area of the lesion. As a result, the area of the lesion on the cucumber treated with the present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 8 were 30% or less than those on untreated plant.
Test Example 7
Plastic pots each were stuffed with soil, and soybean (cultivar; Kurosengoku) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 13 days. To the formulated present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 according to Formulation Example 6, water was added so as to adjust the water dilution to a predetermined concentration (200 ppm), and the adjusted dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the soybean. After 4 days, an aqueous suspension containing spores of soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) was sprayed to inoculate the spores. After the inoculation, the plant was left to stand for 1 day at 23° C. in the daytime and 20° C. at night under high humidity condition, and cultivated in a greenhouse for 14 days; and then the area of the lesion was investigated by observing the area of the lesion. As a result, it was found that the area of the lesion on the plant treated with the present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 were 30% or less than those on untreated plant.
Meanwhile, in the same test using methyl N-(2-{[4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenoxy)methyl}phenyl)carbamate in place of the present Compounds, the result was 70% or more than the treated wheat.
Test Example 8
The present Compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 was diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) so as to adjust the dilution to a predetermined concentration (150 ppm), and 1 μl of the adjusted dilution was dispended into a titer plate (with 96 wells). Thereto was then dispensed 150 μl of liquid culture medium that had been inoculated in advance with conidia of wheat leaf blight fungus (Septoria tritici). This plate was cultured at 18° C. for 4 days, and the wheat leaf blight fungus in each well of the titer plate was measured for a degree pf growth B by using the absorbance at 550 nm. For comparison, untreated leaf blight fungus with a drug was measured for a degree of growth A, and controlling effects were calculated by the following formula.
<in-line-formulae>Controlling effect (%)=100×(A−B)/A </in-line-formulae>
As a result, it was found that the controlling effects of all of the present Compounds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were 70% or more.
Meanwhile, in the same test using methyl N-(2-{[4-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenoxy)methyl}phenyl)carbamate in place of the present Compounds, the controlling effect was 30% or less. In addition, in the same test using methyl N-(2-{[2-methyl-4-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenoxy)methyl}phenyl)-N-methoxycarbamate, the controlling effect was also 30% or less.
