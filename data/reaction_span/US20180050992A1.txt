It also relates to their use as a medicinal product, notably in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component, or as a cosmetic. The compounds of the present invention act as antagonists of the CGRP-R receptor.
The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide of 37 amino acids comprising a C-terminal amide group and a cyclic structure formed with an N-terminal Cys-Cys disulphide bridge (Poyner et al., “The mammalian calcitonin gene-related peptides, adrenomedullin, amylin, and calcitonin receptors”, 2002). CGRP is widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system and is involved in a certain number of biological functions (Edvinsson et al., “CGRP antagonism and migraine”, 2010). There is more and more proof that CGRP plays an important role as a neuromodulator (Ho et al., “CGRP and its receptors provide new insights into migraine pathophysiology”, 2010), but it is especially known as a powerful vasodilator (Brain et al., “Calcitonin gene-related peptide is a potent vasodilator”, 1985).
CGRP signals mainly via a receptor (CGRP-R) that is a heterodimer formed by the association of a receptor coupled to a protein G (RCPG) of class B (calcitonin receptor (CLR or calcitonin-like receptor)) with a transmembrane protein modifying the activity of the receptors (RAMP1 or receptor activity-modifying protein 1) (McLatchie et al., “RAMPs regulate the transport and ligand specificity of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor”, 1998).
The role of CGRP and the activity of the CGRP receptor have been the subject of numerous studies.
As a guide, we may more particularly mention studies that have suggested that migraine crisis is associated with release of CGRP by the meningeal nociceptors of the trigeminal ganglion and that CGRP may therefore play an active role in migraine (Edvinsson et al., “Functional role of perivascular peptides in the control of cerebral circulation”, 1985; Goadsby et al., “Vasoactive peptide release in the extracerebral circulation of humans during migraine headache”, 1990; Lassen et al., “CGRP may play a causative role in migraine”, 2002).
The increasing volume of proof linking CGRP to migraine has led to interest in the development of agents capable of blocking the effects of this neuropeptide. Efforts have notably focused on the development of small molecules that are direct CGRP receptor antagonists (the “gepants”) and non-vasoconstrictive for treating migraine.
These molecules are described in the literature for use by the oral route and thus display metabolic stability at the hepatic level (olcegepant, telcagepant and MK-3207).
However, their development has come up against problems of hepatic toxicity.
Moreover, besides its role in migraine, release of CGRP by the trigeminal nerve innervating the face might be involved in the neurogenic inflammation responsible notably for permanent erythema in type 1 rosacea. This hypothesis is supported by common characteristics between rosacea and migraine, which comprises a neurogenic component with vasoactive phenomena, activation of the trigeminal nervous system and release of neuro-inflammatory peptides (CGRP, substance P, etc.). CGRP is thought to exert its vasodilator action mainly by acting on the smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells of the subcutaneous vessels.
Rosacea is a common chronic and progressive inflammatory dermatosis connected with vascular relaxation. It mainly affects the central region of the face and is characterized by a reddening of the face or hot flushes, facial erythema, papules, pustules, telangiectasia and sometimes ocular lesions called ocular rosacea.
Moreover, these primary characteristics are associated with a secondary neurogenic component, i.e. cutaneous hyperreactivity of the skin of the face and neck, characterized by the appearance of redness and subjective sensations of the itching or pruritus type, sensations of burning or heating, sensations of tingling, formication, discomfort, twinges, etc.
Thus, rosacea is treated conventionally orally or topically with active substances such as antiseborrhoeic and anti-infective agents, for example benzoyl peroxide, retinoic acid, metronidazole or the cyclins.
However, these treatments, which act on the infection and the hyperseborrhoea, do not provide effective treatment and/or prevention of all of the symptoms associated with rosacea, in particular treatment of the neurogenic component of this disorder, and notably hyperreactivity of the skin and redness.
Thus, more particularly patent EP0734729 is known, which discloses the use of a CGRP antagonist for treating redness of the skin of neurogenic origin, and notably rosacea and/or erythema pudicitiae.
However, the only antagonist described is CGRP 8-37, an anti-CGRP peptide. It should decrease the vasodilatation induced by capsaicin and/or cause inhibition of CGRP release by the sensitive nerve fibres and/or cause inhibition of contraction of the smooth muscle of the vas deferens induced by CGRP.
Bearing the foregoing in mind, there is therefore a need for active substances that are effective in the treatment of inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component such as rosacea, which are usable for long periods, with side-effects that are as limited as possible.
One problem that the present invention aims to solve is to propose a treatment for reducing or completely eliminating this inflammation, using a non-peptide antagonist of the CGRP receptor in order to target the neurogenic inflammation, resulting in an effect that persists after the treatment stops, while limiting the side-effects for the patient, in particular the risks of hepatic toxicity.
The applicant has thus identified novel heterocyclic compounds that are CGRP receptor antagonists, selective for the human receptor, which have very good potential as regards biological activity. Unexpectedly, these novel compounds display metabolic instability at the hepatic level, which should limit the risk of hepatotoxicity encountered with many CGRP antagonists known from the prior art, for example olcegepant, telcagepant and MK-3207.

184.1: 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile
A solution of 6 g (47 mmol) of (4-chlorophenoxy)-acetonitrile and 6 g (40 mmol) of 1-methylsulphanyl-4-nitrobenzene in 60 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide is added dropwise to a solution previously cooled to −10° C. of 10.6 g (94 mmol) of potassium tert-butoxide in 120 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction is stirred at −10° C. for 45 min before being hydrolysed with an iced solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with water and then with a saturated solution of sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and then concentrated under vacuum. The crude reaction product is taken up in 1:1 Heptane:EtOAc solution and after trituration for 1 hour, the mixture is filtered and the solid is washed with a 1:1 Hept EtOAc solution, obtaining 2.9 g of 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile (58%) in the form of a solid.
184.2: 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)ethanamine
28 mL of a 1M solution of borane complexed with tetrahydrofuran in tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise at room temperature to a solution of 2.9 g (14 mmol) of 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)acetonitrile in 18 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is then heated under reflux for 3 h. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and 6 mL of methanol is added slowly. After 10 min of stirring and of methanolysis of the borane, the mixture is concentrated under vacuum. The residue is taken up in 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran and the organic phase is washed with 1N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran and the organic phases are combined and concentrated partially. 1 mL of acetic acid is added gently and the mixture is left to return to room temperature while stirring slowly. The mixture is then concentrated under vacuum. 3 g (79%) of 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)ethanamine is obtained in the form of an oil.
184.3: 4-[2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate
3 g (14 mmol) of 2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)ethanamine and 3.1 g (15.4 mmol) of 1-Boc-4-piperidone are added to 40 mL of 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is of low solubility but 4.5 g (21 mmol) of sodium triacetoxyborohydride is added slowly in portions. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 h and then hydrolysed with 15 mL of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide of concentration 2N and extracted with 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran. The organic phase is washed with water again until pH=6, dried over magnesium sulphate and then concentrated. 6.2 g (100%) of 4-[2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate is obtained in the form of an orange-coloured oil.

3.1 g (56 mmol) of iron and 0.4 g (7 mmol) of ammonium chloride are added to a solution of 5.5 g (14 mmol) of 4-[2-(5-methylsulphanyl-2-nitrophenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 14 mL of methanol, 14 mL of 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran (14.00 ml) and 14 mL of water. The inhomogeneous reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 3 h. Once the reaction has ended, the mixture is filtered on Celite and the precipitate is rinsed with methanol. The filtrate is concentrated until the methanol has been removed completely and is then taken up in 2-methyl-tetrahydrofuran and hydrolysed with 10 mL of a 10% solution of EDTA. The organic phase obtained is washed with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and evaporated. 6.1 g (100%) of crude residue of 4-[2-(2-amino-5-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate is obtained in the form of an orange-coloured solid.
184.5: 4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate
2.5 g (20 mmol) of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole is added in portions to a solution of 5.1 g (14 mmol) of 4-[2-(2-amino-5-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 77 mL of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and then diluted with ethyl acetate and hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture in increasing polarity from 7/3 to 5/5. 2.4 g (44%) of 4-[2-(2-amino-5-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate is obtained.
184.5: 7-methylsulphanyl-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one
0.8 mL (8 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid is added to a solution of 1.2 g (3 mmol) of 4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 7 mL of dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature and then concentrated under vacuum. The crude reaction product is taken up in toluene and co-evaporated several times. 0.8 g (90%) of 7-methylsulphanyl-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one is obtained and is used in step 184.9 without additional purification.

The invention further relates to the compounds according to the invention for use thereof as a medicinal product.
Preferably, the compounds according to the invention are used in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component.
The term “prevention of” or “prevent” inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component signifies reducing and/or avoiding the appearance of the symptoms of these diseases.
The term “treatment of” or “treat” inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component signifies reducing and/or inhibiting the development of these diseases and/or of their symptoms.
“Inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component” preferably means inflammatory diseases of the skin with a neurogenic component selected from rosacea of type I (erythematous) and type II (papulopustular), atopic dermatitis, chronic eczema of the hands, psoriasis in its various forms (psoriasis vulgaris, of the scalp, arthritic, pustular, guttate), facial erythema, erythema pudicitiae, urticaria (acute, senile pruritus, prurigo nodularis) and acne, or headaches with neurogenic inflammation such as migraines.
The inflammatory diseases of the skin with a neurogenic component are preferably selected from type I (erythematous) rosacea, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis vulgaris and psoriasis of the scalp, and urticaria of the senile pruritus and prurigo nodularis type, even more preferably type I (erythematous) rosacea.
The compounds according to the invention may also be used in the prevention and/or treatment of inflammatory diseases with a vascular component such as infantile haemangiomata or purpura senilis.
The interest in the novel CGRP receptor antagonist heterocyclic compounds according to the invention in the treatment of inflammatory diseases with a neurogenic component is based on clinical elements emphasizing the parallel between notably rosacea and migraine:the facial localization of the lesions in patients with rosacea is similar to the zones of innervation by the trigeminal nerve, which is also implicated in migraine;the prevalence of migraine sufferers among patients with rosacea is demonstrated by epidemiological studies (≧27% vs 13% in the general population).
It is also based on experimental data:the vasodilator effect of CGRP on the cutaneous vessels has been demonstrated clinically: injection of low doses of CGRP subcutaneously induces erythema that lasts for several hours;topical application of capsaicin induces release of neuropeptides, including CGRP, which is reflected in cutaneous vasodilatation;injection of aCGRP intravenously in the mouse causes the appearance of a flush that is predominantly measurable at the level of the face of the animal. In mRamp1 gene knockout mice, no vasodilator response to this flush with CGRP is observed. Moreover, in these mice, no oedema appears in a model of local neurogenic inflammation induced by the topical application of a TRPV1 agonist. These results seem to confirm a major role of CGRP release in neurogenic inflammation and in flushing.
For this purpose, in general, the compounds according to the invention display good affinity for the CGRP receptor and thus good antagonist activity to the CGRP receptor.
This activity is more particularly illustrated by the GPCR GeneBLAzer® cellular dosage assay, which supplies a uniform method for monitoring the cellular response to candidate medicinal products.
In the GeneBLAzer® GPCR Cell-based Assay model supplied by Invitrogen (Lifetechnologies), activation of the CALCLR:RAMP1 receptor leads to expression of a reporter gene (beta-lactamase). The activity of beta-lactamase is quantified by FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) in the presence of a fluorescent substrate and is directly proportional to the activation of the receptor.
The GeneBLAzer® CALCRL:RAMP CRE-bla HEK293F lines are HEK293F cells that stably overexpress the CALCRL and RAMP1 receptors as well as the reporter gene of beta-lactamase under the control of the cAMP response element (CRE).
The substrate of beta-lactamase contains two fluorophores (fluorescein and coumarin) joined together by a beta-lactam nucleus. In the absence of beta-lactamase and when it is excited at λ=409 nm, the substrate remains intact and the wavelength of emission of fluorescence from coumarin (λ=460 nm) excites the fluorescein, which emits in its turn (λ=530 nm). However, when beta-lactamase is expressed, the substrate is cleaved, separating the two fluorophores and interrupting FRET. The emission from the coumarin will then be proportional to the activation of the receptor.
The cells are seeded in 384-well microplates at a rate of 10 000 cells per well and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Vertical serial dilutions of agonist (α-Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide for RAMP1) are added in competition with horizontal serial dilutions of antagonists to be tested. After incubation for 3 hours at 37° C., the substrate of the beta-lactamase is added to each well and the microplate is incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. The fluorescence is then measured using a microplate reader (λexcitation=409 nm, λemission 1=460 nm, λemission 2=530 nm).

The fluorescence data are normalized using negative controls (cells not stimulated) and positive controls (agonist at saturating concentration).
The dissociation constants for each state of the receptor [“Mechanistic analysis of the function of agonists and allosteric modulators: reconciling two-state and operational models” David Roche, British Journal of Pharmacology (2013) 169 1189-1202] (KdR=affinity for the rest state and KdA=affinity for the activated state) are calculated and the KdR/KdA ratio represents the intrinsic efficacy of the ligand tested: if KdR=KdA, the ligand tested is a neutral antagonist. The different EC50 s of the agonist obtained at each concentration of antagonist tested are linearized (Schild regression [“Quantitation in receptor pharmacology” Terry P. Kenakin, Receptors and Channels (2001) 7 371-385]) in order to determine the apparent affinity (Kdapp) of the antagonist. This value is called apparent because it may fluctuate as a function of the constitutive activation and expression of the receptor and is comparable to Kb in the case of a neutral antagonist.
The affinity results thus obtained for each of the compounds according to the invention tested are presented in Table I below, in which:
Kdapp represents the affinity of the compound for the CGRP receptor;
A represents a Kdapp<10 nM;

Taking into account the results listed in the above table, the compounds according to the invention displaying a Kdapp classified A have very strong affinity for the CGRP receptor. Moreover, these compounds have a KdR/KdA ratio=1 and therefore an antagonist activity of the CGRP receptor.
To the extent that neurogenic inflammation plays an important role in the physiopathology notably of rosacea and migraine, the antagonists to the CGRP receptor according to the invention should thus make it possible to reduce or completely eliminate this inflammation, resulting in an effect that persists after the treatment stops.
Besides their potential as regards biological activity as a powerful and selective antagonist of human CGRP-R, these compounds, advantageously the uracil derivatives, display metabolic instability at the hepatic level and should thus present a limited risk of hepatotoxicity.
This is illustrated more particularly by the test of metabolic stability in the presence of human hepatic microsomes presented below.
Human hepatic microsomes (Becton Dickinson) are incubated at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL in the reaction mixture.
The reaction mixture of the microsomes consists of phosphate buffer pH: 7.4 at 100 mM, MgCl2 at 100 mM (50/50), a system for generating ATP consisting of a mixture of nicotinamide adenine diphosphate (NADP), glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) at 1 mg/mL and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) at 4 U/mL. The compounds are tested at 1 μM (DMSO 0.1%).
The samples are taken from the incubation medium after adding the microsomes, at time 15 minutes. The metabolic reaction is stopped by adding methanol (1 volume incubation medium/3 volumes of methanol). The percentage of the parent product remaining after 15 minutes is measured by LC/MS/MS analysis.
The results obtained are listed in Table 2 below.
