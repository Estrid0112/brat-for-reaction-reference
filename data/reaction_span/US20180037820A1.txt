The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I defined below, to liquid-crystalline media comprising the compounds of the formula I, and to the use of these liquid-crystalline media in liquid-crystal displays.
The principle of electrically controlled birefringence, the ECB effect or else DAP effect (Deformation of Aligned Phases), was first described in 1971 (M. F. Schieckel and K. Fahrenschon, “Deformation of nematic liquid crystals with vertical orientation in electrical fields”, Appl. Phys. Lett. 19 (1971), 3912). This was followed by studies by J. F. Kahn (Appl. Phys. Lett. 20 (1972), 1193) and G. Labrunie and J. Robert (J. Appl. Phys. 44 (1973), 4869).
The studies by J. Robert and F. Clerc (SID 80 Digest Techn. Papers (1980), 30), J. Duchene (Displays 7 (1986), 3) and H. Schad (SID 82 Digest Techn. Papers (1982), 244) showed that liquid-crystalline phases must have high values for the ratio of the elastic constants K3/K1, high values for optical anisotropy Δn and values of dielectric anisotropy Δ∈≦−0.5 in order to be usable for highly informative display elements based on the ECB effect. Electrooptical display elements based on the ECB effect have homeotropic edge orientation (VA methodology=Vertical Aligned).
It is also possible to use dielectrically negative liquid-crystal media in displays that use what is called the IPS (In-Plane Switching) effect (S. H. Lee, S. L. Lee, H. Y. Kim, Appl. Phys. Lett. 1998, 73(20), 2881-2883). The same also applies to displays that use what is called the FFS (Fringe Field Switching) effect.
The technical employment of these effects in electrooptical display elements requires liquid-crystalline phases (LC phases) that have to meet a multitude of requirements. Of particular importance here are chemical stability to moisture, air and physical effects such as heat, radiation in the infrared, visible and ultraviolet region, and electrical DC and AC fields.
Moreover, technically usable LC phases are expected to have a liquid-crystalline mesophase within a suitable temperature range and a low viscosity.
Within the series of compounds having a liquid-crystalline mesophase that are known to date, there is no single compound that meets all these requirements. Therefore, mixtures of compounds are generally provided in order to obtain materials usable as LC phases.
Matrix liquid-crystal displays (MLC displays) are known. Non-linear elements used for individual switching of the individual pixels may, for example, be active elements (i.e. transistors). In that case, reference is made to an “active matrix”, generally with use of thin-film transistors (TFTs) that are generally disposed on a glass plate as substrate.
A distinction is made between two technologies, namely between TFTs composed of compound semiconductors, for example CdSe, and TFTs based on polycrystalline and, inter alia, amorphous silicon. The latter technology currently has the greatest commercial significance on a global scale.
The TFT matrix has been applied to the inside of one glass plate of the display, while the other glass plate optionally bears the transparent counterelectrode on its inside. Compared to the size of the pixel electrode, the TFT is very small and effectively does not disrupt the image. This technology can also be extended for full colour-capable image displays, wherein a mosaic of red, green and blue filters is arranged such that one filter element is opposite each switchable image element.
The most commonly used TFT displays to date typically work with crossed polarizers in transmission and are backlit. IPS cells or ECB (or VAN) cells are used for TV applications, whereas usually IPS cells or TN (Twisted Nematic) cells are used for monitors, and usually TN cells are used for notebooks, laptops and for mobile applications.
The term “MLC displays” encompasses matrix displays having integrated non-linear elements, i.e. having not only the active matrix but also displays with passive elements such as varistors or diodes (MIM=Metal-Insulator-Metal).
MLC displays are especially suitable for TV applications, monitors and notebooks, or for displays with high information density, for example in automobile and aircraft construction. As well as problems with regard to the angle dependence of contrast and the switching times, difficulties arise in the case of MLC displays that are caused by insufficiently high specific resistivity of liquid-crystal mixtures; see, for example, S. Togashi, K. Sekiguchi, H. Tanabe, E. Yamamoto, K. Sorimachi, E. Tajima, H. Watanabe, H. Shimizu, Proc. Eurodisplay 84, September 1984: A 210-288 Matrix LCD Controlled by Double Stage Diode Rings, p. 141 ff., Paris; M. Stromer, Proc. Eurodisplay 84, September 1984: Design of Thin Film Transistors for Matrix Addressing of Television Liquid Crystal Displays, p. 145 ff., Paris. With decreasing resistivity, there is a deterioration in the contrast of an MLC display. Since the specific resistivity of the liquid-crystal mixture generally decreases through interaction with the inner surfaces of the display over the lifetime of an MLC display, a high (initial) resistivity is important for displays that have to have acceptable resistivity values over a long service life.
Displays that use the ECB effect have become established as what are called VAN (Vertically Aligned Nematic) displays alongside IPS displays (e.g. S. D. Yeo, Presentation 15.3: “A LC Display for the TV Application”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book II, p. 758 and 759) and the TN displays that have long been known as one of the three currently most important newer types of liquid-crystal displays particularly for television applications.
The most important designs here include: MVA (Multi-Domain Vertical Alignment, e.g.: H. Yoshide et al., Presentation 3.1: “MVA LCD for Notebook or Mobile PCs . . . ”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book I, p. 6 to 9 and C. T. Liu et al., Presentation 15.1: “A 46-inch TFT-LCD HDTV Technology . . . ”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book II, p. 750 to 753), PVA (Patterned Vertical Alignment, e.g.: Kim, Sang Soo, Presentation 15.4: “Super PVA Sets New State-of-the-Art for LCD-TV”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book II, p. 760 to 763) and ASV (Advanced Super View, e.g.: Shigeta, Mitzuhiro and Fukuoka, Hirofumi, Presentation 15.2: “Development of High Quality LCDTV”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book II, p. 754 to 757).
In general form, the technologies are compared, for example, in Souk, Jun, SID Seminar 2004, Seminar M-6: “Recent Advances in LCD Technology”, Seminar Lecture Notes, M-6/1 to M-6/26 and Miller, Ian, SID Seminar 2004, Seminar M-7: “LCD-Television”, Seminar Lecture Notes, M-7/1 to M-7/32. Even though the switching times of modern ECB displays have already been distinctly improved by drive methods with overdrive (e.g. Kim, Hyeon Kyeong et al., Presentation 9.1: “A 57-in. Broad UXGA TFT-LCD for HDTV Application”, SID 2004 International Symposium, Digest of Technical Papers, XXXV, Book I, p. 106 to 109), the achievement of video-capable switching times, especially in the switching of grey stages, is a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily.
Like ASV displays, ECB displays use liquid-crystalline media with negative dielectric anisotropy (Δ∈), whereas TN displays and all IPS displays in common use to date use liquid-crystalline media with positive dielectric anisotropy. However, it is alternatively also possible to use dielectrically negative liquid-crystalline media in displays based on the IPS or FFS effect. In liquid-crystal displays of this kind, the liquid crystals are used as dielectrics, the optical properties of which change reversibly on application of an electrical voltage.
Since the operating voltage should generally be at a minimum in displays, i.e. including displays according to these mentioned effects, liquid-crystalline media that are generally composed predominantly of liquid-crystal compounds that all have the same sign of dielectric anisotropy and have a maximum magnitude of dielectric anisotropy are used. In general, relatively small proportions at most of neutral compounds and if at all possible no compounds having an opposite sign of dielectric anisotropy to that of the medium are used. In the case of liquid-crystalline media with negative dielectric anisotropy for ECB displays, for example, predominantly compounds having negative dielectric anisotropy are thus used. The liquid-crystalline media used generally consist predominantly and usually actually very substantially of liquid-crystal compounds having negative dielectric anisotropy.
For many practical applications in liquid-crystal displays, however, the known liquid-crystalline media do not have sufficient stability. Particularly the stability thereof to irradiation by UV, but also even by the standard backlighting, leads to a deterioration in the electrical properties in particular. For example, there is a significant increase in conductivity.
For stabilization of liquid-crystal mixtures, the use of sterically hindered amines, called “hindered amine light stabilizers”, HALS for short, has already been proposed.
Nematic liquid-crystal mixtures having negative dielectric anisotropy that contain a small amount of TINUVIN® 770, a compound of the formula
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00001.TIF </img>
as stabilizer are described, for example, in WO 2009/129911 A1. However, the corresponding liquid-crystal mixtures do not have adequate properties for some practical applications. Among other factors, they can sometimes not be stable enough to stress resulting from irradiation with typical CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) backlighting and/or have problems with regard to low-temperature stability.
Similar liquid-crystal mixtures are also known, for example, from EP 2 182 046 A1, WO 2008/009417 A1, WO 2009/021671 A1 and WO 2009/115186 A1. These liquid-crystal mixtures, according to the description therein, may optionally also comprise stabilizers of various kinds, for example phenols and sterically hindered amines (HALS).
These liquid-crystal mixtures may, in a different degree according to the application, in some cases show a deterioration in one or more parameters of relevance in the operation of a liquid-crystal display. More particularly, there can be a drop in the voltage holding ratio (VHR for short) thereof after stress. Moreover, a yellowish discolouration can occur in the event of extreme stress.
Furthermore, the use of various stabilizers in liquid-crystalline media is described, for example, in JP (S)55-023169 (A), JP (H)05-117324 (A), WO 02/18515 A1 and JP (H) 09-291282 (A).
TINUVIN® 123, a compound of the formula
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00002.TIF </img>
has also been suggested for stabilization purposes.
HALS with various substituents on the nitrogen atom are compared with regard to their pKB values in Ohkatsu, Y., J. of Japan Petroleum Institute, 51 (2008), p. 191-204. The following types of structural formulae are described here:

The compound TEMPOL, of the following formula
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00006.TIF </img>
is known; it is mentioned, for example, in Miéville, P. et al., Angew. Chem., 122 (2010), p. 6318-6321. It is commercially available from various manufacturers and is used, for example, in formulations for precursors for polyolefins, polystyrenes, polyamides, coatings and PVC as polymerization inhibitor and, especially in combination with UV absorbers, as light or UV stabilizer.
Prior art liquid-crystal media with appropriately low drive voltages have relatively low electrical resistances or an as yet inadequate, i.e. excessively low, voltage holding ratio (VHR) and, in the displays, often lead to unwanted flicker and/or adequate transmission. Moreover, they are not sufficiently stable to thermal and/or UV stress, at least when they have a correspondingly high polarity as necessary for low drive voltages.
On the other hand, the drive voltage of the prior art displays having a high VHR is often too high, especially for displays that do not have direct connection or through-connection to the power supply grid, for example displays for mobile applications.
Moreover, the phase region of the liquid-crystal mixture has to be sufficiently broad for envisaged display applications.
Furthermore, attention has to be paid to suitable switching times of the liquid-crystal media in the displays. This is particularly important for displays for television or multimedia applications. For improvement of the switching times, there have been repeated past proposals to optimize the rotational viscosity (γ1) of liquid-crystal media, i.e. to implement media having a minimum rotational viscosity. However, the effects achieved are inadequate for many applications.
In addition, adequate stability of the media to extreme stresses, especially to UV and/or thermal stress, has to be assured, particularly in the case of applications in displays in mobile devices, for example mobile phones.
A disadvantage of MLC displays known to date is based on their comparatively low contrast, the relatively high viewing angle dependence and the difficulty in generating shades of grey in these displays, and also their inadequate VHR and their inadequate lifetime.
There is thus still a great need for MLC displays having very high specific resistivity coupled with a simultaneously wide working temperature range, short switching times and a low threshold voltage, with the aid of which it is possible to produce various shades of grey and which especially have a good and stable VHR.
The problem addressed by the invention is that of providing compounds which, in liquid-crystalline mixtures, contribute to advantageous properties in such a way that useful and improved MLC displays, especially those that are based on the ECB effect or on the IPS or FFS effect and also include mobile applications, become obtainable. A particular problem addressed is that of providing compounds and liquid-crystalline media and MLC displays comprising these media that have the above-specified disadvantages only to a lesser degree, if at all, and simultaneously have very high specific resistivities, and moreover also enable working, particularly for mobile systems, even at extremely high and extremely low temperatures.
This object is achieved by the subject-matter of the independent claims. Preferred embodiments are specified in the corresponding dependent claims, and the items, preferred embodiments and special features of the present invention are described hereinafter.

B is preferably trans-1,4-cyclohexylene in which one or more nonadjacent CH2 groups may also be replaced by -O- and/or -S- and in which one or more hydrogen atoms may also be replaced by F, or 1,4-phenylene in which one or two nonadjacent CH groups may also be replaced by N and in which one or more hydrogen atoms may also be replaced by L.
The invention includes embodiments where i and j are each 0, where i and j are each 1, and where one of i and j is 0 and the other of i and j is 1.
In the present invention, it has advantageously been recognized that the inventive compounds of formula I surprisingly have favourable properties and are especially suitable for stabilizing liquid-crystal mixtures both against UV stress and against thermal stress considerably, in many cases to a sufficient degree.
It has also been found that the compounds of formula I have adequate polarity and solubility in liquid-crystalline media. Furthermore, they may have adequate molecular flexibility and favourable interaction and anchoring to surfaces. This combination of properties can advantageously contribute to achieving effective and efficient stabilization of liquid-crystalline media.
It has also been found that, surprisingly, the compounds according to the invention are especially suitable for stabilizing liquid-crystalline media having a nematic phase and negative dielectric anisotropy, especially in the presence of an alignment layer composed, for example, of polyimide.
The present invention thus further provides for the use of one or more compounds of formula I for stabilization of a liquid-crystalline medium, preferably a liquid-crystalline medium having a nematic phase and negative dielectric anisotropy.
As further subject-matter, the present invention provides a process for preparing the inventive compounds of formula I, wherein 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxyl, also called 4-hydroxy-TEMPO or TEMPOL, is used in the process.
In the present invention, it has been recognized that the inventive compounds of the formula I can be prepared in a surprisingly efficient process by using TEMPOL as a starting material. The advantageous compounds of formula I can thus be obtained in an appropriate and useful manner through the use of TEMPOL, or are obtainable thereby.
The present invention further provides a liquid-crystalline medium comprising one or more inventive compounds of formula I and one or more mesogenic compounds.
It has advantageously been recognized that the compounds of formula I can surprisingly effectively and efficiently stabilize liquid-crystalline media, especially against UV and/or thermal stress. Thus, in accordance with the invention, liquid-crystalline media that enable reliable functioning and performance even under comparatively demanding conditions and over comparatively long periods are provided. For example, unwanted display effects such as image sticking or mura can be avoided or distinctly reduced even under extreme conditions or after extreme stresses.
Adequate stabilization of liquid-crystal mixtures both against UV stress and against thermal stress can especially also be achieved when, in addition to the compound of the formula I or the compounds of the formula I, one or more further compounds, preferably phenolic stabilizers, are present in the liquid-crystal mixture. These further compounds are preferably used as stabilizers against thermal stresses.
A further item of subject-matter relates to electrooptical displays or electrooptical components comprising a medium according to the invention.
It has been found that, surprisingly, it is possible to achieve liquid-crystal displays having good stability to break down as a result of thermal and UV stress and have a stable high VHR, even including the initial VHR when the liquid-crystal mixtures according to the invention are used in these display devices.
The media according to the invention are especially suitable for electrooptical displays with active matrix addressing based on the ECB effect and for IPS and FFS displays.
Without thus restricting the present invention, the detailed description of the items, preferred embodiments and special features that follows is intended to clearly illustrate the invention and describe particular embodiments in more detail.
The present invention provides compounds of the formula I having advantageous properties for the stabilization of liquid-crystalline media in particular.
The compounds according to the invention here each have two tetramethylpiperidinyl groups each joined to one another via an ether bond and the further groups shown in the formula I. Thus, in an advantageous manner, two ether-bonded HALS groups, i.e. specific sterically hindered secondary amines bearing no hydrogen atoms on the α-carbon atoms, per molecule are provided in such a way that they are able to effectively and efficiently stabilize liquid-crystal mixtures both against UV stress and against thermal stress.
The presently provided combination of structural elements of formula I, especially the two HALS groups, the direct ether bonds and the further defined groups, including the spacer groups and any lateral substituents, besides the direct stabilizing effect by the HALS groups gives sufficient polarity and solubility in liquid-crystalline media and sufficient molecular flexibility and, as the case may be, favourable interaction and anchoring with surfaces.
This combination of properties can advantageously contribute to achieving sufficient stabilization of liquid-crystalline media. More particularly, it has been recognized that the use of the compounds according to the invention and of media comprising these compounds is advantageous in liquid-crystal displays in which surface influences, for example originating from alignment layers of polyimide and the associated interactions, can be significant.
According to the formula I, Sp1 and Sp2 are each independently a spacer group. The term “spacer group” is known to those skilled in the art and is described in the literature; see, for example, Pure Appl. Chem. 73(5), 888 (2001) and C. Tschierske, G. Pelzl, S. Diele, Angew. Chem. 2004, 116, 6340-6368.
In this context, the spacer groups are advantageously and preferably flexible linking or bridging groups, i.e. flexible segments. In a preferred embodiment, Sp1 and Sp2 are each independently straight-chain or branched alkylene, preferably straight-chain alkylene, having 1 to 12 carbon atoms which is optionally mono- or polysubstituted by F, Cl or CN, and in which one or more nonadjacent CH2 groups may each independently be replaced by -O-, -S-, -NH-, -CO-, -COO-, -OCO-, -OCO-O-, -CH═CH- or -C≡C-. The optional replacement is effected in such a way that no two oxygen atoms are directly bonded to one another in the molecule.
Typical and particularly preferred spacer groups Sp1 and Sp2, in each case independently, are, for example, -(CH2)p1-, -(CH2CH2O)q1-CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2-S-CH2CH2- and -CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2-, in which p1 is an integer from 1 to 12, more preferably 2 to 12, and q1 is an integer from 1 to 3.
Particularly preferred groups are, for example, straight-chain ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, nonylene, decylene, undecylene, dodecylene, octadecylene, ethylenoxyethylene, methylenoxybutylene, ethylenethioethylene, ethylene-N-methyliminoethylene, 1-methylalkylene, ethenylene, propenylene and butenylene.
In a particularly preferred embodiment, Sp1 and Sp2, in each case independently, are ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, and especially propylene.
In one embodiment, Sp1 and Sp2 do not include a group -CO-.
It is preferable that Sp1 and Sp2 have the same definition, i.e. the same structure.

where the group preferably consists of one of these structures.
In a preferred embodiment, compounds of the formula I where i=1 and j=0 are provided.
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the compound(s) of the invention is/are selected from compounds of the formula I-A

where Sp1 and Sp2 have the definitions given above and L1 to L4 are each independently H, F or straight-chain or branched, in each case optionally fluorinated alkyl having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, in which one or more nonadjacent CH2 groups may also be replaced by -O-.
More particularly, L1 to L4 are more preferably each independently H, F or straight-chain alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In one embodiment, at least two of L1 to L4 are H, where the remaining group(s) from L1 to L4 is/are selected from F, methyl, ethyl and propyl.
If i=0 and j=0, in a preferred embodiment, the Sp1, Z0 and Sp2 groups together form an unbranched alkyl group, preferably having at least 9 carbon atoms, further preferably having 9 to 16 carbon atoms.
Particularly preferred compounds of the formula I are selected from the following compounds of the formulae I-1 to I-12:
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00016.TIF </img><img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00017.TIF </img>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, the compound of the formula I is a compound of the formula I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4, I-5, I-6 or I-7, especially I-1.
These compounds are of particularly excellent suitability as stabilizers in liquid-crystal mixtures, in which case they especially stabilize the VHR of the mixtures against UV stress.
The inventive compounds of the formula I can be prepared by standard methods known from the literature and, as the case may be, standard modifications known to those skilled in the art (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart).
In the present case, it has advantageously been recognized that a particularly favourable and effective process for preparing the compounds of the formula I can be provided by using TEMPOL as a starting material.
A general synthesis method for preparation of compounds according to the invention is shown below.
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00018.TIF </img>
where n and m are each independently 0 or 1 and Ln is in each case independently 1, 2, 3 or 4 optional substituents L, where L is the same or different at each instance and is F, Cl, CN or a straight-chain or branched, in each case optionally fluorinated alkyl, alkoxy, arylalkyl or alkylarylalkyl having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, in which one or more nonadjacent CH2 groups may also be replaced by -O- and/or -S-.
According to the invention, one or more compounds of the formula I can advantageously be used for stabilization of liquid-crystalline media. More particularly, the compounds according to the invention can have a favourable effect on stability in the case of dielectrically negative liquid-crystalline media, especially in the presence of one or more alignment layers of polyimide, for example. In the displays according to the invention, this can advantageously lead to particularly short switching times with a simultaneously high voltage holding ratio (VHR).
For this purpose, a method of stabilizing a liquid-crystalline medium is provided, wherein one or more compounds of the formula I are added to the medium.
In a preferred embodiment, the stabilization relates to a liquid-crystalline medium having a negative dielectric anisotropy. In this case, at the most appreciable amounts of dielectrically uncharged liquid-crystal compounds and generally only very small amounts of dielectrically positive compounds, if any, are used, since liquid-crystal displays are generally supposed to have minimum drive voltages.
Preferably, the liquid-crystalline media according to the invention comprise one or more compounds selected from the group of compounds of the formulae II-1 to II-4
<img> id-US20180037820A1-20180208-C00019.TIF </img>
whereR21 is a unsubstituted alkyl radical having 1 to 7 carbon atoms,R22 is an unsubstituted alkyl radical having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, or an unsubstituted alkoxy radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms,andm, n and o are each independently 0 or 1.
It has been found that, surprisingly, it is possible to achieve liquid-crystal mixtures which, especially in ECB displays and for IPS or FFS displays with active matrix addressing, have a low threshold voltage coupled with short switching times and simultaneously have a sufficiently broad nematic phase, a favourable, relatively low birefringence (Δn), good stability to breakdown by thermal and UV stress and a stable high VHR when nematic liquid-crystal mixtures comprising at least one compound of the formula I and at least one compound selected from the group of compounds of the formulae II-1 to II-4, preferably of the formula II-3, are used.
The mixtures according to the invention preferably exhibit very broad nematic phase regions with clearing points ≧70° C., very favourable values for the capacitative threshold, relatively high values for VHR and simultaneously good low-temperature stabilities at −20° C. and −30° C., and also very low rotational viscosities. Moreover, the mixtures according to the invention preferably feature a good ratio of clearing point and rotational viscosity, and a high negative dielectric anisotropy.
It has also been found that, surprisingly, it is possible to achieve liquid-crystalline media having a suitably high Δ∈, a suitable phase region and a suitable Δn, which have the disadvantages of the prior art materials at least to a considerably lesser degree, if at all. More particularly, it has been found here, surprisingly, that the compounds of the formula I, even when they are used alone without additional thermal stabilizers, lead to considerable stabilization, in many cases sufficient stabilization, of liquid-crystal mixtures both against UV stress and against thermal stress.

In this case, the dielectric anisotropy of the compounds is determined by dissolving 10% of the compounds in a liquid-crystalline host and determining the capacitance of the resulting mixture in at least one test cell in each case having layer thickness 20 μm with homeotropic and homogeneous surface orientation at 1 kHz. The measurement voltage is typically 0.5 V to 1.0 V, but it is always lower than the capacitative threshold of the respective liquid crystal mixture under examination.
The host mixture used for dielectrically positive and dielectrically uncharged compounds is ZLI-4792, and that used for dielectrically negative compounds is ZLI-2857, both from Merck KGaA, Germany. The change in the dielectric constant of the host mixture after addition of the compound to be examined and extrapolation to 100% of the compounds used are used to obtain the values for the particular compounds to be examined. The compound to be examined is dissolved in a concentration of 10% in the host mixture. If the solubility of the substance is too low for this, the concentration is halved stepwise until the study can be effected at the desired temperature.
The compositions consist of two or more compounds, preferably of 3 or more to 30 or fewer, more preferably of 6 or more to 20 or fewer and most preferably of 10 or more to 16 or fewer compounds that are mixed in a conventional manner. In general, the desired amount of the components used in a smaller amount is dissolved in the components that make up the main constituent of the mixture. This is appropriately effected at elevated temperature. If the temperature chosen is above the clearing point of the main constituent, the completion of the dissolution operation can be observed particularly easily. However, it is also possible to produce the liquid crystal mixtures in other customary ways, for example using preliminary mixtures or from what is called a “multi-bottle system”.
The mixtures according to the invention exhibit very broad nematic phase regions, preferably with clearing points of 65° C. or more, very favourable values for the capacitative threshold, relatively high values for the holding ratio and simultaneously very good low-temperature stabilities at −30° C. and −40° C. In addition, the mixtures according to the invention feature low rotational viscosities γ1.
It will be self-evident to the person skilled in the art that the media according to the invention for use in VA, IPS, FFS or PALC displays may also comprise compounds in which, for example, H, N, O, Cl, F are replaced by the corresponding isotopes.
The construction of the liquid crystal displays according to the invention corresponds to the standard geometries as described, for example, in EP 0 240 379 A1.
By means of suitable additives, it is possible to modify the liquid crystal phases according to the invention such that they are usable in any kind of ECB, VAN, IPS, FFS, GH or ASM-VA LCD display, for example, that has become known to date.
Table E below specifies possible dopants which can generally be added to the mixtures according to the invention. If the mixtures comprise one or more dopants, it is used in amounts of 0.01% to 4%, preferably 0.1% to 1.0%.
Additional stabilizers which may be added, for example, to the mixtures according to the invention, preferably in amounts of 0.01% to 6%, especially 0.1% to 3%, are specified below in Table F.
For the purposes of the present invention, all concentrations, unless explicitly noted otherwise, are stated in percent by mass and relate to the corresponding mixture or mixture component, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
According to the present invention, all the values specified for temperatures, for example the melting point T(C,N), the transition from the smectic (S) to the nematic (N) phase T(S,N) and the clearing point T(N,I), are reported in degrees Celsius (° C.), and all temperature differentials are correspondingly reported as degrees of difference (° or degrees), unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The term “threshold voltage” in respect of the present invention relates to the capacitative threshold (V0), also called the Fréedericksz threshold, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
All physical properties are and were determined according to “Merck Liquid Crystals, Physical Properties of Liquid Crystals”, Status November 1997, Merck KGaA, Germany and apply to a temperature of 20° C., and Δn is determined at 589 nm and Δ∈ at 1 kHz, unless explicitly stated otherwise in each case.
The electrooptical properties, for example the threshold voltage (V0) (capacitative measurement), and likewise the switching characteristics, are determined in test cells manufactured by Merck Japan. These test cells have substrates composed of soda-lime glass and are designed in an ECB or VA configuration with polyimide alignment layers (SE-1211 with **26 diluent (mixing ratio 1:1), both from Nissan Chemicals, Japan), which are rubbed at right angles to one another and bring about a homeotropic orientation of the liquid crystals. The area of the transparent, virtually square electrodes composed of ITO is 1 cm2.
The liquid-crystal mixtures used, unless stated otherwise, have not been admixed with a chiral dopant, but they are also particularly suitable for applications where such a doping is required.
The VHR is determined in test cells produced by Merck Japan. The test cells have substrates composed of soda-lime glass and have been provided with polyimide alignment layers having a layer thickness of 50 nm. The cell gap is a uniform 6.5 μm. The area of the transparent electrodes composed of ITO is 1 cm2.
Unless stated otherwise, the VHR is determined at 20° C. (VHR20) and after 5 minutes in an oven at 100° C. (VHR100) in a commercially available instrument from Autronic Melchers, Germany. The voltage used has a frequency within a range from 1 Hz to 60 Hz, unless stated more precisely.
The accuracy of the measurements of the VHR depends on the particular value of the VHR. The accuracy decreases with decreasing values. The deviations that are generally observed at values in the different size ranges are compiled in terms of their order of magnitude in the table which follows.

Stability against irradiation with UV is examined in a commercial “Suntest CPS” instrument from Heraeus, Germany. This involves irradiating the sealed test cells without additional thermal stress for between 30 min and 2.0 hours, if not stated explicitly. The irradiation output in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm is 765 W/m2, if not stated explicitly. A UV cut-off filter having a cut-off wavelength of 310 nm is used to simulate “window glass mode”. In each test series, for every condition, at least four test cells are examined and the respective results are reported as mean values of the corresponding individual measurements.
The decrease in the voltage holding ratio (ΔVHR) which is typically caused by the stress, for example by irradiation with UV by LCD backlighting, is determined by the following equation (1):
<in-line-formulae>ΔVHR(t)=VHR(t)−VHR(t=0)  (1).</in-line-formulae>
The rotational viscosity is determined by the rotating permanent magnet method, and the flow viscosity in a modified Ubbelohde viscometer. For the liquid crystal mixtures ZLI-2293, ZLI-4792 and MLC-6608, all products from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, the values of rotational viscosity determined at 20° C. are 161 mPa·s, 133 mPa·s and 186 mPa·s respectively, and the flow viscosity (v) values 21 mm2·s−1, 14 mm2·s−1 and 27 mm2·s−1 respectively.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the following symbols are used:V0 threshold voltage, capacitative [V] at 20° C.,ne extraordinary refractive index measured at 20° C. and 589 nm,no ordinary refractive index measured at 20° C. and 589 nm,Δn optical anisotropy measured at 20° C. and 589 nm,∈⊥ dielectric susceptibility at right angles to the director at 20° C. and 1 kHz,∈∥ dielectric susceptibility parallel to the director at 20° C. and 1 kHz,Δ∈ dielectric anisotropy at 20° C. and 1 kHz,cp. or T(N,I) clearing point [° C.],ν flow viscosity measured at 20° C.

11.0 g (103.8 mmol) of sodium carbonate are initially charged in 50 ml of water. 10.0 g (32.2 mmol) of 4-bromo-2-ethyl-1-iodobenzene, 15.0 g (105.6 mmol) of 2-butoxy-[1,2]oxaborolane and 0.50 ml (3.67 mmol) of triethylamine are dissolved in 250 ml of tetrahydrofuran and added to the reaction solution and degassed under an argon stream for 40 min. Then 170 mg (0.96 mmol) of palladium(II) chloride (59% Pd, anhydrous) and 0.90 g (1.92 mmol) of 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2,6-diisopropoxy-1,1-biphenyl are added and the mixture is stirred under reflux for 18 h. On completion of conversion, the reaction mixture is cooled down to room temperature and admixed with water and methyl tert-butyl ether (MtBE), and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with MtBE, and the combined organic phases are washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is filtered with dichloromethane/methanol through silica gel (300 g, 50 μm Combiflash system), and the product fractions are concentrated under reduced pressure.
The desired product is obtained as a yellowish oil.

18.2 g (81.9 mmol) of alcohol 2 and 1.0 g (8.2 mmol) of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine are initially charged in 100 ml of dichloromethane (DCM), and 25 ml (309.7 mmol) of pyridine are added. The reaction mixture is cooled to 3-4° C., and 15.0 ml (193.4 mmol) of methanesulphonyl chloride are added dropwise. 5 min after addition, the cooling bath is removed and then the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. On completion of conversion, the reaction mixture is poured cautiously onto water and the phases are separated. The water phase is extracted with DCM, and the combined organic phases are washed with 2 N hydrochloric acid and water, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily crude product is filtered through 1 litre (I) of silica gel with (DCM:MTB ether 98:2 to 95:5 to 9:1), and the product fractions are concentrated under reduced pressure.

To 6.20 g (155 mmol) of sodium hydride (60% in paraffin oil) at room temperature (RT) are cautiously added 50 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and the mixture is heated to 40° C. At this temperature, a solution of 27.0 g (157 mmol) of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (free-radical) is added dropwise (gentle evolution of hydrogen gas). On completion of addition and after evolution of gas has ended, the mixture is stirred at 40° C. for another 2 hours and then cooled down to room temperature. Then a solution of 23.6 g (62.4 mmol) of mesylate 3 in 100 ml of DMF is added within 10 min (the temperature rises here by 5° C. to 30° C.) and then the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 h. The reaction solution is cautiously poured onto ice-water and extracted with MTB ether. The phases are separated and the water phase is extracted with MTB ether. The organic phases are combined, dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is obtained as a red oil and is filtered through 1.3 l of silica gel with a mixture of heptane (H)/ethyl acetate (EA) (2:1). The product fractions are concentrated under reduced pressure and the product is obtained as a red solid. The mixture is filtered once again through 1 l of silica gel with H:EA (3:1 to 2:1), and the product obtained is crystallized from 250 ml of heptane and 10 ml of ethanol at −20° C.
The product is obtained as an orange solid.

These mixtures are examined for their stability as described hereinafter.
First of all, what is called the initial voltage holding ratio (VHR (initial)) is examined. For this purpose, the VHR is determined in test cells produced by Merck Japan. The test cells have substrates composed of soda-lime glass and have been designed with polyimide alignment layers (AL-16301 from Japan Synthetic Rubber, Japan) with a layer thickness of 50 nm that have been rubbed at right angles to one another. The layer thickness is a uniform 6.5 μm. The area of the transparent electrodes composed of ITO is 1 cm2.
The VHR is determined at 20° C. (VHR20) and after 5 minutes in an oven at 100° C. (VHR100) in a commercially available instrument from Autronic Melchers, Germany, at 1 V and 60 Hz.
The values of VHR (initial) thus ascertained are listed in Table 2.
In addition, light stability to sunlight, i.e. stability to irradiation with UV/sunlight, is examined in a commercial “Suntest CPS” instrument from Heraeus, Germany.
For determination of VHR in relation to sunlight stability, a lamp that emits the wavelength spectrum of sunlight is used. The test is conducted at 20° C. and the irradiation time corresponds to 30 min. The sealed test cells are irradiated here with a lamp (Hoya, 340 nm cut filter, T=50% at 340 nm) at 20° C. without additional thermal stress for 0.5 hour, over the course of which the intensity measured with a 365 nm sensor is 3 J/cm2. Thereafter, the voltage holding ratio in each case is determined after 5 minutes at a temperature of 100° C.
The VHR values thus ascertained for the sun test (VHR (suntest)) are likewise listed in Table 2.

It is found that the mixtures according to the invention can be distinctly stabilized, even if they contain the corresponding compounds of the formula I in relatively low concentrations.
In addition, light stability to backlighting is examined, by examining the mixtures in a test cell with an alignment material for planar alignment and full-area ITO electrodes for their light stability (backlighting). For determination of the VHR with respect to light stability to backlighting, sealed test cells are tested with a commercially available backlighting unit without additional thermal stress. The duration of irradiation corresponds to max. 1000 h. The results (VHR (BL)) are listed in Table 3.
