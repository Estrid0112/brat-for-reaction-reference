The heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be one selected from Compounds 1 to 87 below, but embodiments are not limited thereto:
The heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may include a benzacridine core. The heterocyclic compound may form a π-conjugated system in an entire structure and may have a structure with low intramolecular steric hindrance. Therefore, a tight packing between molecules may be facilitated to thereby improve charge transport capability. Also, the π-conjugated structure of the heterocyclic compound may contributed to a high glass transition temperature (Tg) and a high melting point. Therefore, an organic light-emitting device including the heterocyclic compound may have high durability, and excellent device characteristics such as a low driving voltage and high efficiency in operation.
In an example embodiment, the heterocyclic compound has a structure in which a substituent is linked to the benzacridine core at the C5 carbon position. The heterocyclic compound may have reduced intramolecular steric hindrance between a linker and the substituent, and may have a smaller dihedral angle, which may expand the it-conjugated system. Furthermore, the molecule may have a rod shape as a whole, and the heterocyclic compound may have higher electron mobility.
π-conjugation may be disrupted by bending of 9,10 substitution of an anthracene core due to steric hindrance. However, 2,6 substitution may reduce a dihedral angle and expand the π-conjugated system, which may provide the effects of high electron mobility.
Synthesis methods of the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 are described referring to Examples provided below.
At least one of the heterocyclic compounds represented by Formula 1 may be used between a pair of electrodes of an organic light-emitting device. For example, the heterocyclic compound may be included in at least one of an electron transport region and an emission layer. In another implementation, the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be used as a material for forming a capping layer disposed outside the pair of electrodes of the organic light-emitting device.
According to one or more embodiments, an organic light-emitting device may include: a first electrode; a second electrode facing the first electrode; and an organic layer that is disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode and includes an emission layer, wherein the organic layer includes at least one of the heterocyclic compounds represented by Formula 1.
The expression “(an organic layer) includes at least one of the heterocyclic compounds” used herein may include a case in which “(an organic layer) includes identical heterocyclic compounds represented by Formula 1” and a case in which “(an organic layer) includes two or more different heterocyclic compounds represented by Formula 1.”
For example, the organic layer may include, as the heterocyclic compound, only Compound 1. In this regard, Compound 1 may exist in an electron transport layer of the organic light-emitting device. In one or more embodiments, the organic layer may include, as the heterocyclic compound, Compound 1 and Compound 2. In this regard, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may exist in an identical layer (for example, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may both exist in an emission layer), or different layers (for example, Compound 1 may exist in an electron transport layer and Compound 2 may exist in an electron transport layer).
In an example embodiment, the organic layer includes i) a hole transport region that is disposed between the first electrode (anode) and the emission layer and includes at least one of a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a buffer layer, and an electron blocking layer and ii) an electron transport region that is disposed between the emission layer and the second electrode (cathode) and includes at least one of a hole blocking layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. At least one selected from the electron transport region and the emission layer may include at least one of the heterocyclic compounds represented by Formula 1. For example, the electron transport region may include an electron injection layer and an electron transport layer, and at least one selected from the electron injection layer and the electron transport layer may include at least one of the heterocyclic compounds. In one embodiment, the electron transport region may include an electron transport layer, wherein the electron transport layer may include at least one of the heterocyclic compounds. In one embodiment, the emission layer may include a pyrene-based compound, but embodiments are not limited thereto.
The organic light-emitting device may further include at least one selected from a first capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward outside through the first electrode and a second capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward outside through the second electrode, and the at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include at least one of the heterocyclic compounds.
For example, the organic light-emitting device may have i) a stack structure including a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, ii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, and a second electrode which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, or iii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, and at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include the heterocyclic compound.
The term “organic layer”” as used herein refers to a single layer and/or a plurality of layers between the first electrode and the second electrode of an organic light-emitting device. A material included in the “organic layer” is not limited to an organic material.

Example 1
An anode was prepared by cutting an ITO glass substrate, on which ITO/Ag/ITO were respectively deposited to 70 Å/1,000 Å/70 Å, to a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.5 mm, ultrasonically cleaning the ITO glass substrate (anode) using isopropyl alcohol and pure water each for 5 minutes, and then, exposing the ITO glass substrate (anode) to UV irradiation for 30 minutes and ozone to clean the ITO glass substrate. Then, the ITO glass substrate (anode) was loaded into a vacuum deposition apparatus.
N-([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-9,9-dimethyl-N-(4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine (Compound 301) and F4-TCNQ were co-deposited on the ITO glass substrate (anode) at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 100 Å. Compound 301 as a hole transport compound was vacuum-deposited on the hole injection layer to form a first hole transport layer having a thickness of 1,200 Å. N,N-di([1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-4'-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-amine (Compound A) was vacuum-deposited on the first hole transport layer to form a second hole transport layer having a thickness of 100 Å.
9,10-di-naphthalene-2-yl-anthracene (ADN) as a blue fluorescent host and N,N,N',N'-tetraphenyl-pyrene-1,6-diamine (TPD) as a blue fluorescent dopant were co-deposited on the second hole transport layer at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
Then, Compound 1 and LiQ were co-deposited on the emission layer at a weight ratio of 5:5 to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, LiF as alkali metal halide was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å, and Mg and Ag were vacuum-deposited on the electron injection layer at a weight ratio of 90:10 to form a cathode electrode having a thickness of 120 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
Examples 2 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4
Organic light-emitting devices of Examples 2 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4 were manufactured in the same manner as in Example 1, except that Compounds shown in Table 1 were each used instead of Compound 1 in forming an electron transport layer.
Evaluation Example 1
The driving voltage, efficiency, and color coordinates of the organic light-emitting devices, which were manufactured in Examples 1 to 10 and Comparative Examples 1 to 4, at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 were evaluated. The lifespan (T97) refers to a period of time that has lapsed until the luminance was reduced to 97% of the initial luminance at the current density of 1.0 mA/cm2. Results thereof are shown in Table 2.
