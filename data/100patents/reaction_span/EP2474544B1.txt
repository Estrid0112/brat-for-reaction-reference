The present invention relates to an agent for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an anxiety disorder such as panic disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, particular phobia, generalized anxiety disorder or the like.
Background Art
Anxiety disorder
Anxiety disorders are a class of psychological problems, important features of which include excess anxiety, fears, concern, avoidance, forced rituals and the like, and these can cause excess incidence rates, overuse of medical care services, and functional impairment, or result in such outcomes. These are one of the most common psychomedical conditions in the US and almost all other countries. The incidence rate for this disorder is fairly uniform across different cultures. Mostly, females are more likely to experience anxiety disorders than males. Chronic anxiety disorders can raise the cardiovascular mortality rate, so that the appropriate diagnosis and quick treatment initiation are required.
The anxiety disorders listed in the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (4th edition - revised in 1994, published by the American Psychiatric Association, Washington D.C., US, p.393-444) include panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, agoraphobia without history of panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), an anxiety disorder resulting from general medical conditions, drug-induced anxiety disorder, specific phobias, non-specified anxiety disorders and the like.
Panic disorder with or without agoraphobia
Panic disorders are a type of anxiety disorders, an essential feature of which is recurrent panic attacks (that is, a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort with at least four characteristic related symptoms). Attacks normally last for several minutes (or, in rare cases, several hours) and are unforeseeable. And it does not have the tendency for occurring before exposure to a situation that nearly always causes anxiety, or immediately after exposure, as in the case of simple phobia. This "unforeseeable" aspect of attacks is an essential feature of this type of disorders. A panic attack begins with the sudden occurrence of intense anxiety or fear, and is typically accompanied by physical symptoms, for example, short breaths, vertigo, syncope, choking, palpitation, tremors, sweating, ague, nausea, numbness, hot sensation or chilling, chest pain, and the like. Panic disorders are sometimes associated with agoraphobia; in serious cases, the affected person substantially refuses to leave his or her house.
In clinical samples, agoraphobia is encountered at a higher rate, whereas in local social samples, about one-third to half of persons diagnosed with panic disorders are also suffering agoraphobia.
Agoraphobia without history of panic disorder
Agoraphobia is a condition characterized by anxiety about being in a place or situation which it may be difficult (or embarrassing) to escape, or where it can be impossible to seek help, in the event of a panic attack or a panic-like symptom (for example, fear of the onset of sudden attacks of vertigo or sudden attacks of diarrhea). Agoraphobia occurs in a situation where there are neither panic disorders with agoraphobia nor history of panic disorders. Except that the object of fear resides in the onset of attacks of limited symptoms, rather than immobility-causing or extremely embarrassing panic-like symptoms or complete panic attacks, the essential feature of agoraphobia without history of panic disorders is the same as the feature of panic disorders with agoraphobia.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Primary symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorders are completely severe because they can cause distress, take much time, or considerably hamper people's normal daily activity or lifestyle, and they are recurrent obsessions (that is, thoughts, images or urges that are recurrent, and endure and cause remarkable anxiety) and/or compulsions (that is, repetitive behaviors or mental actions executed to modify anxiety caused by the affected person's obsessions). Obsessions are typically related to pollution, doubt (including loss of self-confidence), and blasphemy of sexual or religious thought. Typical compulsions include the act of washing, the act of confirmation, the act of arranging objects in order, the act of counting objects and the like.
Social phobia
Social phobia is characterized by an obstinate social or public fear that can be embarrassing. Typical situations which a person with social phobia fears or avoids include parties, meetings, taking a meal in the presence of other person, writing in the presence of other person, speeches, conversations, the first meeting with a non-acquaintance, other related situations and the like. Being exposed to a social or public situation not only causes immediate anxiety reactions, but also almost always causes sweating, tremors, throbbing or striking heartbeats, mental confusion, and the desire to run away.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
Major characteristic symptoms include re-experience of an event due to posttraumatic stress (that is, psychological agony), escape of stimuli that recall the event, general reactive paralysis, increased arousal, and the like. Related "events" include, for example, mere bereavement, chronic disease, marital friction and the like.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
GADs are essentially characterized by a state where unrealistic or excess anxiety and two or more living environmental concerns last for 6 months or more. There are more days on which the sufferer realizes it difficult to control this situation and is annoyed by the concerns than those without. Signs such as motor tension, autonomic hyperactivity, vigilance, and scanning are clearly manifested.
Particular phobia
Specific phobias are anxiety disorders, the essential feature of which is remarkable fear of limited stimulus (a circumscribed stimulus); this limited stimulus can be said to be an object or situation other than the fear of experiencing a panic attack, getting ashamed, or being embarrassed, in a social situation (this is classified under social phobias). For example, airplane phobia, acrophobia, zoophobia, trypanophobia, hemophobia and the like can be exemplified.
Regarding anxiety disorders, a wide variety of causes are suspected; in particular, genetic temperaments, growth and development in infancy and childhood, as well as combinations thereof with later life experiences are suspected. Anxiety disorders are treated by using counseling, psychotherapy, pharmacological therapy (drug therapy) and the like singly or in combination. Drugs that are typically used to treat anxiety disorder patients include benzodiazepine; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone, and the like.
Benzodiazepine belongs to a major class of relatively safe, widely prescribed drugs having quick and adequate anxiolytic effects and sedative hypnotic effects. Drugs belonging to the class of SSRIs and SNRIs are used for the treatment of, for example, anxiety disorders such as panic disorder, agoraphobia, OCD, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, specific phobias, and a broader range of anxiety disorders [Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive textbook of psychiatry 7th. edition, 1, p.1441 (1999)]. Buspirone, a relatively selective 5HT1A partial agonist, is approved by the FDA as the most useful anxiolytic drug for the treatment of GAD, and is currently frequently used as an auxiliary for SSRIs [Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive textbook of psychiatry 7th. edition, 1, p.1441 (1999)].
On the other hand, it is known that adenosine is widely distributed in the whole body, and exhibits a variety of physiological actions on the central nervous system, the cardiac muscle, the kidneys, the smooth muscle, and the like through its receptors (see non-patent document 1).
For example, adenosine A1 antagonists are known to facilitate defecation (Jpn. J. Pharmacol., Vol.68, p.119 (1995)). Further, the adenosine A2A receptors are known to be involved particularly in the central nervous system, and the antagonists of the adenosine A2A receptors are known to be useful as, for example, therapeutic drugs for Parkinson's disease (see non-patent document 2), therapeutic drugs for sleep disturbance (see Nature Neuroscience, p. 858 (2005); patent document 3), therapeutic drugs for depression (Neurology, 61(11 Suppl 6), S82-7 (2003)) and the like. There are many reports concerning the relationship between adenosine receptors and Parkinson's disease (Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 5, p.845 (2006); Current Pharmaceutical Design, 14, p.1475 (2008)).
Regarding the association between adenosine A2A receptors and depressive symptoms, an investigation using mice deficient in adenosine A2A receptors led to a report that adenosine A2A receptor antagonizing action induces behavioral pharmacological changes similar to those with administration of antidepressants (Br. J. Pharmacol., 134, p.68 (2001)). Xanthine compounds possessing adenosine A2A receptor antagonizing activity are known to possess antidepressive activity (for example, WO94/01114), and are known to further possess anti-Parkinsonian activity (for example, Ann. Neurol., 43, p. 507 (1998)), therapeutic effects on anxiety disorders (for example, WO2004/108137), suppressing activity against neurodegeneration (for example, WO99/12546) and the like. Combinations of adenosine A2A receptor antagonists and antidepressants or anxiolytic drugs have been reported (see Patent Document 1).
On the other hand, for example, compounds represented by the formulas (IA), (IB), (IC), (ID) and the like are known to have affinity to adenosine A2A receptors and have a therapeutic effect for Parkinson's disease (see patent document 2). It is also known that these compounds are useful as an agent for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of sleep disturbance (see patent document 3).<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img><img> id-imgb0002.tif </img>

Test Example 1: Adenosine Receptor Binding Action
(1) Adenosine A2A Receptor Binding Test
The test can be performed according to, for example, the method of Varani et al. (British Journal of Pharmacology, 117, p. 1693 (1996)).
Specifically, for example, human recombinant Adenosine A2A receptors are expressed in HEK-293 cells. The cell membranes of the receptor-expressing cells are collected, and a cell membrane suspension is prepared. After dilution with tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris HCl) buffer, tritium-labeled 2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino]-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (3H-CGS21680: 50 mmol/L) and a test compound solution (dimethyl sulfoxide solution of the test compound) are added to the cell membrane suspension for binding to the receptors. After the reaction, the mixture is subjected to rapid suction filtration using glass-fiber filter paper, and the radioactivity of the glass-fiber filter paper is measured. In this way, the inhibitory rate of the test compound for the human adenosine A2A receptor binding (3H-CGS21680 binding) can be determined.
The test can also be performed according to the method of Bruns et al. (Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 29, p. 331, 1986).
Specifically, for example, rat striatum is suspended in 50 mL of ice-cooled Tris HCl buffer (50 mmol/L, pH 7.7) using a Polytron homogenizer and the suspension is centrifuged. The resulting precipitate is resuspended by adding Tris HCl buffer (50 mmol/L) thereto, followed by centrifugation in the same manner. The resulting final precipitate is suspended in Tris HCl buffer (50 mmol/L) [containing magnesium chloride (10 mmol/L), and adenosine deaminase (0.02 units/mg tissue)] to prepare the suspension at the tissue concentration of 5 mg (wet weight)/mL. Tritium-labeled CGS-21680 (final concentration of 6.0 mmol/L), and the test compound solution (dimethyl sulfoxide solution of test compound diluted with Tris HCl buffer) are added. The mixture is allowed to stand at 25°C for 120 minutes, followed by rapid suction filtration using glass-fiber filter paper, and then immediately washed with ice-cooled Tris HCl buffer (50 mmol/L). The glass-fiber filter paper is then placed in a vial, and MicroScinti (PKI) is added. Then, the radioactivity is measured with a TopCount (PerkinElmer), whereby the inhibitory rate for rat adenosine A2A receptor binding (3H-CGS21680 binding) of the test compound can be determined.
The inhibitory rate can be calculated by the following equation.<img> id-imgb0021.tif </img>Inhibitory rate%=1−Amount of binding in the presence of drug−Amount of non−specific bindingTotal amount of binding−Amount of non−specific binding×100
In the equation, the total amount of binding refers to the bound radioactivity of 3H-CGS21680 in the absence of the test compound. The amount of non-specific binding refers to the bound radioactivity of 3H-CGS21680 in the presence of 50 µmol/L of 5'-N-ethylcarboxamideadenosine (NECA) or 100 µmol/L of cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). The amount of binding in the presence of drug refers to the bound radioactivity of 3H-CGS21680 in the presence of the test compound.
In the above test, the inhibitory rate for the adenosine A2A receptor at different concentrations of the test compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the test compound concentration at which the test compound inhibits binding by 50% (IC50) can be calculated by appropriately adjusting the concentration of the test compound.
The inhibition constant (Ki value) of the test compound for the adenosine A2A receptor binding can be calculated according to the following equation.<img> id-imgb0022.tif </img>Ki=IC50/1+L/Kd
In the equation, L denotes the concentration of the 3H-CGS21680 used in the test, and Kd is the dissociation constant of the 3H-CGS21680 used in the test.
Instead of 3H-CGS21680, 3H-5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine (3H-SCH58261) and the like may be used.
(2) Adenosine A1 Receptor Binding Test
The inhibition constant (Ki value) of the test compound for the adenosine A1 receptors can be calculated in the same manner as in (1), using the materials below.
Specifically, for example, human A1 receptor-expressing CHO cell membranes are used, and, as the labeled compound, for example, tritium-labeled 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (3H-DPCPX) is used. The amount of non-specific binding can be determined by measuring the 3H-DPCPX bound radioactivity in the presence of, for example, 100 µmol/L of (-)-N6-2-phenylisopropyl adenosine (R(-)-PIA). The affinity of the test compound for the human adenosine A1 receptors can be confirmed in this manner.
Alternatively, for example, rat A1 receptor-expressing cell membrane (PerkinElmer) is used, and as the labeled compound, for example, tritium-labeled N6-cyclohexyladenosine (3H-CHA) is used. For the measurement of the amount of non-specific binding, 3H-CHA bound radioactivity is measured in the presence of, for example, 10 µmol/L of DPCPX, and the affinity of the test compound for the rat adenosine A1 receptors can be confirmed.
By the foregoing tests (1) and (2), the selective affinities of the thiazole derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof used in the present invention for the adenosine A2A receptors can be confirmed.
(3) Affinity of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for adenosine receptors

Test Example 3: Effect of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof on marble burying behavior test in mice
This test is known as one of the test systems for anxiolytics (Folia Pharmacologica Japonica, 126, p.94 (2005)). Marble-burying behavior is a behavior of the mouse to bury marbles in spread planer bedding on which the marbles were placed, and is suppressed, without being accompanied by motor inhibition, by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Since the behavior of the mouse to attempt to cover and bury harmless marbles in planer bedding is apparently similar to compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders that are repeated while they recognize them as being unreasonable, and also since SSRIs are effective as therapeutic drugs for obsessive-compulsive disorders, and for other reasons, the marble burying behavior is getting positioned as an animal model of obsessive-compulsive disorder
The male ICR mice (weighing 27.6 to 42.9 g; Japan SLC, Inc.) were used in this study. One hour after oral administration of a vehicle [water for injection (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Factory) containing methylcellulose (MC) at a concentration of 0.5 w/v%; 0.5 w/v% MC solution; control group] or the test compound (prepared by being suspended in 0.5 w/v% MC solution to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.1 mL per 10 g of mouse body weight; drug group), each mouse was placed in a cage, in which 25 marbles (18 mm in diameter) were equally placed on the surface of planer (up to 5 cm from the bottom of the cage). At 30 minutes later, the number of marbles more than half-buried in the planer was counted. The counting was performed under blinding conditions.
The effects of the drug are expressed as the actually measured number of buried marbles and the inhibition rate calculated by the following equation.<img> id-imgb0023.tif </img>Inhibition%=number of buried marbles in control group−number of buried marbles in drug groupnumber of buried marbles in control group×100
When the compound (IC) was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg, the mouse marble burying behavior was significantly inhibited (% inhibition: 73.7%).
Since the compound (IC) exhibited an inhibition effect in the above-described test, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorders.
Test Example 4: Action of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in rat social interaction test
Two separately reared rats weighing nearly the same are placed in the same measuring cage and examined for social interactions such as sniffing, following, and grooming exhibited by the two rats. It is known that these social interactions increase with administration of existing anxiolytics. This test is thought as an animal model of social phobia or generalized anxiety disorders because it is consider that contradictory social environments between two rats cause stress (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 408, p.41 (2000)).
The male SD rats (weighing 201.8 to 285.6 g; Charles River Japan Inc.)were used in this study. On the day of behavioral evaluation, the animals were acclimatized to the test environment from 4 hours before the start of the experiment. Sixty minutes after oral administration of a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC solution) or a test compound (prepared in suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.5 mL per 100 g of rat body weight), two rats were allowed to meet each other in an acrylic box (50 x 50 x 50 cm). The total time of social interaction behaviors (sniffing, following, grooming and the like) during monitoring for 10 minutes immediately after meeting (between-rats interaction time) were measured with a stopwatch.
When the compound (IC) was administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, the between-rats interaction time increased significantly (119.3 ±9.0 seconds versus 85.2 ±7.6 seconds for vehicle treatment, P=0.01545, Dunnett test). Spontaneous activity also increased significantly (12922.7 ±646.8 counts versus 8635.3 ±506.4 counts for vehicle treatment, P<0.001, Dunnett test).
Since the compound (IC) exhibited an effect in the above-described test, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of anxiety disorders, including social phobia and/or generalized anxiety disorders.
Test Example 5: Effect of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof on drug-induced anxiety-like behavior in rat social interaction test
Using the method of Test Example 4, the effect of a compound on the anxiety induced with administration of an anxiogenic substance was examined. Yohimbine (adrenalin α2 receptor antagonist) is known as one of the anxiogenic substance. It is thought that locus coeruleus hyperactivity that accompanies α2 receptor antagonizing action is contributory to the anxiety-inducing action of Yohimbine. Anxiety symptoms that develop with administration of Yohimbine to healthy persons were reported to be similar to panic disorders, in the pathophysiology of which abnormal locus coeruleus activity is considered to be largely involved. For this reason, Yohimbine-induced anxiety is thought to be a model well reflecting anxiety symptoms (for example, panic disorders) that accompany abnormal locus coeruleus activity.
Meanwhile, meta-chlorophenylpiperadine hydrochloride (mCPP) is an anxiogenic substance having a 5-HT2 receptor stimulation action. It was reported that mCPP induced anxiety symptoms in healthy subjects and aggravated the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in humans. The mCPP-induced anxiety response is an experimental model that well reflects anxiety (for example, generalized anxiety disorder) caused by abnormal signaling especially via 5-HT2 receptors.
First, the effect on Yohimbine-induced anxiety was examined.
In a group receiving a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC solution) administered 30 minutes before the measurement, the observed mean between-rats interaction time was 90.6±7.1 seconds. In contrast, in a group receiving Yohimbine administered 30 minutes before the measurement (prepared by being dissolved in 0.5 w/v% MC solution to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.25 mL per 100 g of rat body weight, and orally administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg), the between-rats interaction time decreased significantly (57.6±3.4 seconds, P=0.0010, Aspin-Welch test). When the compound (IC) (prepared in suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.25 mL per 100 g of rat body weight) was administered at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg 30 minutes before administration of Yohimbine, the above-described interaction time reduction by Yohimbine (5 mg/kg) improved significantly (0.03 mg/kg: 90.3±5.0 seconds, P = 0.00019, Steel test).
Next, the effect on mCPP-induced anxiety was examined.
In a group receiving a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC, orally administered at 0.25 mL per 100 g of rat body weight) administered 30 minutes before the measurement, the observed mean between-rats interaction time was 83.4±5.1 seconds. In contrast, in a group receiving mCPP administered 30 minutes before the measurement (prepared by being dissolved in 0.5 w/v% MC solution to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.25 mL per 100 g of rat body weight, and orally administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg), the between-rats interaction time decreased significantly (32.5±3.6 seconds, P<0.001, Student's t-test). When the compound (IC) (a suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution prepared to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.25 mL per 100 g of rat body weight) was administered at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg 30 minutes before administration of mCPP, the above-described interaction time reduction by mCPP (0.5 mg/kg) improved significantly (0.3 mg/kg: 62.4±6.9 seconds, P<0.001, Dunnett test).
Since the compound (IC) exhibited an effect in the above-described test, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of drug-induced anxiety disorders. Also, the compound (I) was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of anxiety disorders, including panic disorders and generalized anxiety disorders.
Test Example 6: Effect of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof on Vogel conflict test in rats
This test is to measure drinking counts (number of shocks during drinking) when an electric shock is applied to a water-deprived rat at each time that the rat drinks water. Under this condition, a rat is thought to be placed under a state of conflict between the motivation to drink (positive reinforcing factor) and the aversion to receiving an electric shock (negative reinforcing factor, punishment). When anxiolytics are administered to a rat, anxiety about punishing stimuli is suppressed and behavior in an attempt to take a positive reinforcer is observed. This test is thought to be an animal model of generalized anxiety disorders (Folia Pharmacologica Japonica, 115, p.5 (2005), Japanese Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, 9, p.2389 (2006)).
The male Wistar rats (weighing 148.4 to 211.7 g; Japan SLC, Inc.) and an operant experimental apparatus were used in this study. The chamber consisted of a soundproof box, and a test cage (25 × 30 × 25 cm), a shock generator, a controller, a licking sensor and PC analysis system placed in the soundproof box. The test cage has 20 grids on the floor and a metal nozzle on the inner wall. Through the nozzle, rats were allowed for free access to drinking water. A mild electric current was applied between the floor grids and the metal nozzle in the test cage. Current conduction by licking (drinking) was detected with the licking senor and measured with the PC analysis system via the controller. An electric current was generated using the shock generator between the floor grids and the metal nozzle in the test cage to apply electric shocks to rats. The rats were acclimated in the test cage for 10 minutes, then transferred to the housing cage and deprived from water. After 24 hours elapsed, the animals were placed in the test cage, allowed for free access to drinking water for 5 minutes (without electric shocks), again transferred to the housing cage and deprived from water. After 24 hours elapsed, the animals were allowed for free access to drinking water for 5 minutes in the test cage (pre-drug session without electric shocks). Twenty nozzle licks were counted as one drinking response and drinking frequency (drinking count) was determined (pre-value). At 60 minutes after the pre-drug session, a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC solution) or a test compound (a suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution prepared to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.5 mL per 100 g of rat body weight) was orally administered, 60 minutes after administration, the test was performed for 5 minutes (test-punished session, with electric shocks). In the test-punished session, an electric shock of 0.16 mA, 0.2 sec/shock was delivered to the animals between the floor grid and the drinking nozzle after every 20th lick by drinking of rat (punished drinking). Animals that did not drink water were excluded from the evaluation and the drinking counts only in animals that were in a state of conflict were averaged and compared.
In the test-punished session, the drinking count was decreased by electric shocks compared with that in the pre-drug session (pre-drug session: 26.7±1.2 times, vehicle treatment group: 6.1±0.8 times). When the compound (IC) was administered at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg, the number of electric shocks received increased significantly (12.7±1.7 times, P=0.003846, Steel-test).
Since the compound (IC) exhibited an effect in the above-described test, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders.
Test Example 7: Effect of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof on elevated plus maze test in rat
In this test, a conflict arises between rodent's exploratory drive and an innate aversion to bright open new spaces (open arms), accordingly, it has been reported that drugs having anti-anxiety activity increase the time spent in the open arms and the number of open arm entries, while anxiogenic substance decreases these parameters (Japanese Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, 9, p.2389 (2006)). This test is thought to be an animal model of generalized anxiety disorders (Folia Pharmacologica Japonica, 115, p.5 (2005), Japanese Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology, 9, p.2389 (2006)).
The male SD rats (weighing 133.8 to 260.2 g; Charles River Japan Inc.) were used in this study. An apparatus was used wherein two open arms (50x10 cm) extending on the same line from a 10 cm-square central area and two enclosed arms (50x10 cm) surrounded by a wall of 40 cm height are perpendicularly crossing. Sixty minutes after oral administration of a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC solution) or a test compound (a suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution prepared to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.5 mL per 100 g of rat body weight), each rat was placed in the center of the elevated plus maze with its head facing toward the enclosed arm and immediately observed for its behavior for 5 minutes. The rat behavior on the maze was recorded with a digital video camera positioned on the ceiling of the laboratory. The times spent and number of entries in the open arms, enclosed arms and central platform, and distance travelled were determined using analysis software. The time spent in the open arms, percentage of open arm entries (ratio of the number of entries in the open arms to the total number of entries in the open and enclosed arms) and total distance travelled on the maze during the monitoring period were determined to evaluate the influences of the test compound.
The time spent in the open arms, the percentage of open arm entries, and total distance travelled on the maze in rats with administration of the vehicle were 21.6 ±7.4 seconds, 15.5 ± 3.0%, and 2521.97±95.34 cm, respectively. When the compound (IC) was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, significantly increased the time spent in the open arms and the percentage of open arm entries (the time spent: 61.6±10.9 seconds, P=0.01687, the percentage: 33.4±6.3%, P=0.04759, Steel test). Compound (IC) did not affect the total distance travelled on the maze (2414.83±102.13 cm).
Since the compound (IC) exhibited an effect in the above-described test, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorders.
Test Example 8: Effect of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof on the conditioned fear stress (CFS) test in rats
In this test (Folia Pharmacologica Japonica, 113, p.113 (1999)), the influences of psychological stress resulting from past aversion experience on living organisms can be measured as behavioral suppression (freezing reaction) or autonomic nervous system hyperactivity (increases in respiratory rate and blood pressure).
The male SD rats (weighing 140.2 to 320.0 g; Charles River Japan Inc.) and a contextual learning test system were used in this study. The experimental apparatus is consisted of a soundproof box, and a test cage (20 × 20 × 25 cm), a shock generator, a controller, an external monitor and PC analysis system, which were placed in the soundproof box. The test cage has stainless bars on the floor at 1-cm intervals. A scrambled electric current was generated from the shock generator using a command of the special program. The inside of the soundproof box was equipped with a speaker. A buzzer sound of 65 dB was generated via the controller using a command of the special program. The animal behavior within the test cage was recorded with a CCD camera, which was positioned on the ceiling of the soundproof box. Immobilization continuing for at least 2 seconds was defined as freezing. The percentage of freezing behavior was determined by (Freezing time/Test time) × 100. Conditioning trials were performed under the conditions shown below. Each rat was placed in the cage for 5 minutes and received electric shocks (0.3 mA × 5 seconds) from the floor grids six times in total (60, 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210 seconds). A buzzer sound (10 kHz, 65 dB) was generated for 10 seconds from 5 seconds before each electric shock. Retention trials were performed under the conditions shown below. On the following day of conditioning, sixty minutes after the administration of a vehicle (0.5 w/v% MC solution) or a test compound (a suspension in 0.5 w/v% MC solution prepared to obtain a dosing concentration of 0.5 mL per 100 g of rat body weight), the rat was placed in the test cage for 5 minutes. According to the same schedule as that on the previous day, only a buzzer sound was generated six times and the duration of freezing behavior was measured. The 5-minute test period was divided into a pre-tone period (0 to 1 minute) from immediately after exposure to the test environment until generation of a buzzer sound, a with-tone period (1 to 4 minutes) during generation of a buzzer sound and a post-tone period (4 to 5 minutes) after generation of a buzzer sound. The percentage of freezing behavior during these periods was compared.
Administration of the compound (IC) at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg, significantly decreased the percentage of freezing behavior in the with-tone period (vehicle treatment group: 90.2±2.6 seconds, compound treatment group: 57.1±9.9 seconds, P=0.02867, Steel test). Also compound (IC) significantly decreased the percentage of freezing behavior also in the post-tone period (vehicle treatment group: 59.8±9.6 seconds, compound treatment group: 23.4±8.1 seconds, P=0.01559, Dunnett test).
Therefore, the compound (I) having a selective affinity for adenosine A2A receptors was considered to be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of anxiety disorders, including psychological stress-induced anxiety disorders (posttraumatic stress disorders).
While compound (IC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be administered alone as it is, usually it is preferably provided in the form of various pharmaceutical preparations. Such pharmaceutical preparations can be used for animals and human.
The pharmaceutical preparation according to the present invention may contain, as the active ingredient, compound (IC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof either alone or as a mixture with any other therapeutic active ingredient.

For example, ointment, cream and the like can be produced by, for example, dissolving or mixing-dispersing the active ingredient in a base such as white petrolatum and the like.
The dose and administration frequency of compound (IC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof varies depending on administration form, age and body weight of patients, properties or severity of the symptoms to be treated and the like. For general oral administration, 0.001 - 1000 mg, preferably 0.05 - 100 mg, is administered to one adult in one to several portions a day. For parenteral administration such as intravenous administration and the like, 0.001 - 1000 mg, preferably 0.01 - 100 mg, is generally administered to one adult in one to several portions a day. For transdermal administration, an external preparation containing 0.001 - 10% of compound (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is generally applied once to several times a day. However, these doses and administration frequencies vary depending on the aforementioned various conditions.
A combination of compound (IC) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more of other pharmaceutical components can also be used as the agent of the present invention for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of an anxiety disorder.
