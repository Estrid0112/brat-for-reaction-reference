SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
The polymeric material may contain a crosslinking agent unreacted as an impurity when the polymeric material is cured with a conventional crosslinking agent. The conventional crosslinking agent has a low molecular weight. When the polymeric material containing such impurity is used as a member of a semiconductor manufacturing process equipment, outgases are generated, thereby causing problems such as process errors.
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a polymeric material which contains a small amount of low molecular weight impurities when is cured.
Means to Solve the Problem
As a result of intensively studying of the inventors of the present invention in order to solve the above problem, the inventors have found that the problem can be solved by using a self-crosslinking polymer capable of crosslinking without using the crosslinking agent. The inventors of the present invention have focused a nitrileoxide compound causing a click reaction, and have studied a polymer having a nitrileoxide group. The inventors of the present invention have found that a polymer which is able to cause an intermolecular crosslinking reaction and cure without the need of the conventional crosslinking agent by introducing a plurality of nitrileoxide groups into the molecule of the polymer. In addition, the inventors have found that the polymer having a plurality of nitrileoxide groups in the molecule can be used in place of the conventional crosslinking agent. It is noted that the known polymer having a nitrileoxide group is only a polymer having one nitrileoxide group at the terminal of the acrylate or styrene-based backbone, and since such polymer has only one nitrileoxide group, it cannot crosslink between molecules.
Further, the inventors have also studied a process for producing the polymer having a plurality of nitrileoxide groups. As a result, the inventors have focused a method of synthesizing a polymer by using a monomer having a nitrileoxide group, and have found that by reacting a nitrileoxide monomer having two nucleophilic groups at the molecular terminals as the monomer with a condensation polymerizable or addition polymerizable monomer, the polymer described above can successfully be obtained. In addition, the inventors have found that by performing the polymerization using a compound having a nitrileoxide group and an ethylenic double bond as a monomer, the polymer described above can successfully be obtained.
Furthermore, the inventors have found that the polymer described in Patent Literature 3 is synthesized by performing the polymerization providing a the acrylate or styrene based main chain and using a compound having a nitrileoxide group as a terminator, and the reaction of functionalizing a terminal described in Patent Literature 3 is low efficient. In addition, in this method, it is impossible to introducing a nitrileoxide group into a position other than the terminal of a molecular main chain of a polymer, for example, in central portion, and it is difficult to introducing a nitrileoxide group into both terminals of the molecular main chain.
As a result of intensively studying of the inventors of the present invention with respect to the above problems, the inventors have found that by using a nitrileoxide compound having a nucleophilic group as a polymerization initiator, a nitrileoxide group may efficiently be introduced into the polymer. In addition, the inventors have found that by using this method, it is possible to introduce a nitrileoxide group into the central portion of a molecular main chain of a polymer and to introduce a nitrileoxide group into the both terminals of the polymer.

The base material applied with the hydrophilizing agent of the present invention is not limited as long as it has a reactive group with the nitrileoxide group. For example, by reacting the hydrophilizing agent of the present invention with a compound having low hydrophilic, the hydrophilic of the compound can be increased. In addition, by reacting the hydrophilizing agent of the present invention with a surface of a non-hydrophilic resin, the hydrophilic of the surface of the resin can be increased.

When the fluorine-containing polymer is a vinylidene fluoride polymer, it is possible to mix it with the compounds of the present invention by melt-kneading, thereby forming a porous polymer membrane having excellent properties. In this respect, the composition is preferably a composition obtained by melt-kneading the compound of the present invention and polyvinylidene fluoride or a copolymer having a vinylidene fluoride unit.

The ratio by mole between the vinylidene fluoride unit and the tetrafluoroethylene unit in the vinylidene fluoride/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer is more preferably 50 to 95/50 to 5, still more preferably 50 to 90/50 to 10. In addition to the vinylidene fluoride/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer consisting only of a vinylidene fluoride unit and a tetrafluoroethylene unit, the vinylidene fluoride/tetrafluoroethylene copolymer may be a ternary or higher copolymer having not only a vinylidene fluoride unit and a tetrafluoroethylene unit but also any other units such as a hexafluoropropylene unit, a chlorotrifluoroethylene unit, and a perfluorovinyl ether unit to the extent that these units do not deteriorate the characteristics
The weight average molecular weight of the copolymer including a vinylidene fluoride unit varies in accordance with the application of the resulting porous polymer membrane.

The weight average molecular weight can be determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
In one embodiment, the other polymeric material may comprise a resin other than vinylidene fluoride polymer.
Examples of the resin other than vinylidene fluoride polymer include polyethylene resin, polypropylene resin, acrylic resin, polyacrylonitrile, acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) resin, polystyrene resin, acrylonitrile-styrene (AS) resin, vinyl chloride resin, polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide resin, polyacetal resin, polycarbonate resin, modified polyphenylene ether resin, polyphenylene sulfide resin, polyamide imide resin, polyether imide resin, polysulfone resin, polyether sulfone resin, and mixtures and copolymers thereof.

The acrylic resin is a polymeric compound mainly containing acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or a derivative thereof, such as a polymer of acrylamide or acrylonitrile. Particularly preferred are acrylate resin and methacrylate resin.
The resin other than vinylidene fluoride polymer is most preferably acrylic resin.
The characteristics of the resulting porous polymer membrane such as membrane strength, water permeability, and the blocking performance can be adjusted by adjusting the type and the amount of the resin other than vinylidene fluoride polymer.
In order to achieve hydrophilization, to control phase separation, and to improve the mechanical strength, the composition of the present invention may further contain additives such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethyl methacrylate resin, polyethylene glycol, montmorillonite, SiO2, TiO2, CaCO3, and polytetrafluoroethylene
The porous polymer membrane described above can be produced by any of various methods. Examples thereof include phase separation, melt extraction, vapor solidification, stretching, etching, sintering of a polymer sheet into a porous membrane, crushing of a bubble-containing polymer sheet into a porous membrane, and electrospinning.
The melt extraction is a method of forming a porous structure by melt-kneading inorganic particles and organic liquid matter with a mixture; extrusion-molding the kneaded matter through a die or molding it with a press at a temperature not lower than the melting points of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer; cooling and solidifying the molded article; and then extracting the organic liquid matter and the inorganic particles.
The vapor solidification is a method of forcedly supplying saturated vapor or vapor containing mist of one or both of a nonsolvent and a poor solvent which are compatible with a good solvent and do not dissolve the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer for at least one surface of a membrane-like article formed from a composition prepared by dissolving the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in a good solvent.
In a preferable embodiment, the porous polymer membrane of the present invention is preferably produced by the phase separation because the pore size is easily controlled. Examples of the phase separation include thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS).
In the case of thermally induced phase separation, the porous polymer membrane of the present invention can be produced by a method including a step of dissolving the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in a solvent that is a poor solvent or a good solvent at a relatively high temperature to provide a composition, and a step of cooling and solidifying the composition.
The composition prepared by dissolving the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in a solvent is in the form of a uniform single-phase liquid when it is maintained at a temperature higher than what is called a cloud point. In contrast, phase separation occurs at a temperature not higher than the cloud point so that the composition is separated into two phases, i.e., a polymer-rich phase and a solvent-rich phase. When the temperature reaches the crystallization temperature or lower, the polymer matrix is immobilized, so that a porous membrane is formed.
In the case of thermally induced phase separation, the sum of the amounts of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in the composition is preferably 10 to 60% by mass relative to the sum of the amounts of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer, and the solvent. It is more preferably 15 to 50% by mass.
The viscosity of the composition can be adjusted within an appropriate range by adjusting the concentration of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer within an appropriate range. If the viscosity of the composition is beyond an appropriate range, the porous polymer membrane may not be formed
The poor solvent is a solvent that is not capable of dissolving 5% by mass or more of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer at a temperature lower than 60° C. but capable of dissolving 5% by mass or more thereof at a temperature of 60° C. or higher and not higher than the melting points of the resins. In contrast to the poor solvent, a solvent that is capable of dissolving 5% by mass or more of the resins even at a temperature lower than 60° C. is called a good solvent. A solvent that neither dissolves nor swells the resins until the temperature reaches the melting points of the resins or the boiling point of the liquid is called a nonsolvent.
Examples of the poor solvent include middle-chain-length alkyl ketones, esters, glycol esters and organic carbonates such as cyclohexanone, isophorone, γ-butyrolactone, methyl isoamyl ketone, dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, aliphatic polyhydric alcohols, propylene glycol methyl ether, propylene carbonate, diacetone alcohol, and glycerol triacetate, and solvent mixtures thereof. Fluorosolvents such as HFC-365, diphenyl carbonate, methyl benzoate, diethylene glycol ethyl acetate, or benzophenone may also be used. Even with respect to a solvent mixture of a nonsolvent and a poor solvent, a solvent that satisfies the definition of a poor solvent is defined as a poor solvent.
In the case of thermally induced phase separation, a solvent for the composition is preferably, but not limited to, a poor solvent. As a result of examining the behavior of phase separation of a fluoropolymer, a good solvent may be used in some cases.
Examples of the good solvent include fluorosolvents such as HCFC-225, lower alkyl ketones, esters, and amides such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl formamide, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, methanol, tetrahydrofuran, tetramethylurea, and trimethyl phosphate, and solvent mixtures thereof.
Examples of the nonsolvent include water, aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, aromatic polyhydric alcohols, and chlorinated hydrocarbons or other chlorinated organic liquids such as hexane, pentane, benzene, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, o-dichlorobenzene, trichloroethylene, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, pentane diol, hexane diol, methanol, ethanol, propanol, and low molecular weight polyethylene glycol, and solvent mixtures thereof.
In the case of thermally induced phase separation, the step of providing a composition is preferably a step of dissolving the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in a solvent that is a poor solvent or a good solvent at 20° C. to 270° C. The dissolving temperature is preferably 30° C. to 250° C. When dissolved at a relatively high temperature, the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer can be at a high concentration. This enables production of a porous polymer membrane having high mechanical strength. If the concentration of the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer is too high, the resulting porous polymer membrane may have a low porosity, resulting in poor water permeability. If the viscosity of the prepared composition is beyond an appropriate range, a porous membrane may not be formed.
The composition is preferably cooled and solidified by a method of ejecting the composition into a cooling bath through a die, for example. For the porous polymer membrane in the form of a flat membrane, a method of casting and immersing the composition in a cooling bath is also one preferable method.
Those able to be used as a cooling liquid for the cooling bath have a temperature lower than that of the composition. Examples thereof include a liquid containing a solvent that is a poor solvent or a good solvent at a temperature of 0° C. to 80° C. and a concentration of 60 to 100% by mass. The cooling liquid may be a nonsolvent or a nonsolvent containing a poor solvent or a good solvent.
In the production of the porous polymer membrane of the present invention, important features are the concentration of the composition, the constitution of the solvent that dissolves the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer, and the constitution of the cooling liquid constituting the cooling bath. The porous structure of the porous polymer membrane can be adjusted by adjusting these compositions.
For example, one surface and the other surface of the porous polymer membrane may have different combinations of the constitution of the composition and the constitution of a cooling liquid. Thereby, the structure of the one surface of the porous polymer membrane may be made different from the structure of the other surface.
In producing the porous polymer membrane by nonsolvent-induced phase separation, for example, the porous polymer membrane is preferably produced by a method including a step of dissolving the compound of the present invention and the fluorine-containing polymer in a solvent to provide a composition, and a step of ejecting the composition into a solidification bath containing a nonsolvent through a die.
Immersion of the composition in a solidification bath containing a nonsolvent can cause nonsolvent-induced phase separation with the concentration gradient between the solvent and nonsolvent in the composition and the solidification bath used as a power for phase separation. In such a method, a fine skin layer is first formed on the outer surface where phase separation occurs due to replacement between the solvent and the nonsolvent. Then, the phase-separating phenomenon proceeds toward the inside of the membrane. As a result, after the formation of the skin layer, an asymmetric membrane can also be produced in which the pore size continually increases toward the inside of the membrane.
In the case of nonsolvent-induced phase separation, the composition preferably comprises the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer, and the solvent. The composition further comprising a nonsolvent in addition to the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer, and the solvent is also one preferable embodiment.
The composition preferably contains 5 to 60% by mass of the compound of the present invention, and the fluorine-containing polymer relative to the sum of the amounts of the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer, the solvent, and the nonsolvent (if the composition contains no nonsolvent, the sum of the amounts of the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer, and the solvent). This value is more preferably 10 to 50% by mass.
The composition preferably contains 0.1 to 10% by mass of the nonsolvent relative to the sum of the amounts of the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer, the solvent, and the nonsolvent. This value is more preferably 0.5 to 8% by mass. The viscosity of the composition can be adjusted within an appropriate range by adjusting the fluoropolymer concentration within an appropriate range. If the viscosity of the composition is beyond an appropriate range, a porous polymer membrane may not be formed.
The composition may be at room temperature or may be heated. For example, the composition is preferably at 10° C. to 75° C.
The solvent to be used in nonsolvent-induced phase separation may be any solvent exemplified for thermally induced phase separation. The solvent may be either a poor solvent or a good solvent, and is preferably a good solvent. The nonsolvent may be any nonsolvent exemplified for thermally induced phase separation.
With respect to a solidification liquid to be used as the solidification bath, solidification is preferably achieved using a liquid containing a nonsolvent. The liquid may further contain a poor solvent and a good solvent. The nonsolvent may be any nonsolvent exemplified for thermally induced phase separation. For example, water may suitably be used.
In production of the porous polymer membrane of the present invention, the thermally induced phase separation and the nonsolvent-induced phase separation may be used in combination.
The nonsolvent-induced phase separation and the thermally induced phase separation can provide a porous membrane by ejecting a composition prepared by dissolving the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer in a solvent through a die and solidifying the composition. Examples of the die include slit dies, double orifice spinnerets, and triple orifice spinnerets.
In the case of producing a porous polymer membrane in the form of a hollow fiber membrane, the die to be used is preferably a double orifice spinneret or a triple orifice spinneret for spinning hollow fiber membranes.
In the case of a double orifice spinneret, the composition is emitted from the outer tube of the double orifice spinneret, while a hollow-forming fluid such as ion exchange water is emitted from the inner tube, and then the composition is solidified in a solidification bath or a cooling bath. Thereby, a hollow fiber membrane can be produced.
The hollow-forming fluid is usually in the form of gas or liquid. In thermally induced phase separation, a liquid containing a poor solvent or a good solvent at a concentration of 60 to 100%, which is the same as the cooling liquid, can preferably be used. Alternatively, a nonsolvent or a nonsolvent containing a poor solvent or a good solvent may also be used. In the nonsolvent-induced phase separation, the hollow-forming fluid is preferably the aforementioned nonsolvent. For example, water such as ion exchange water is preferred. The aforementioned nonsolvent may contain a poor solvent or a good solvent.
In thermally induced phase separation, the hollow-forming fluid is preferably the aforementioned solvent. For example, a poor solvent such as glycerol triacetate is preferred. In thermally induced phase separation, nitrogen gas may also be used.
A hollow fiber membrane with two structures may be formed by varying the constitution of a hollow-forming fluid and of a cooling liquid or solidification liquid. The hollow-forming fluid may be supplied in the cooled state. If the cooling force of the cooling bath alone is sufficient for solidifying the hollow fiber membrane, the hollow-forming fluid may be supplied without cooling.
A triple orifice spinneret is suitable for the cases of using two resin solutions. For example, two compositions are emitted from the outer tube and the middle tube, respectively, of the triple orifice spinneret, while a hollow-forming liquid is emitted from the inner tube, and then the compositions are solidified in a solidification bath or a cooling bath. Thereby, a hollow fiber membrane can be formed. Alternatively, a composition is emitted from the outer tube of the triple orifice spinneret, a resin solution containing a resin other than the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer is emitted from the middle tube, and a hollow-forming fluid is emitted from the inner tube, while the emitted materials are solidified in a solidification bath or a cooling bath. Thereby, a hollow fiber membrane can be formed. The resin other than the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer may be any of those mentioned above. Preferred is the aforementioned thermoplastic resin, and more preferred is acrylic resin.
As mentioned above, production of a hollow fiber membrane by a method using a double orifice spinneret or a triple orifice spinneret is preferred in that the amount of a solidification liquid or a cooling liquid can be smaller than in production of a flat membrane.
The porous polymer membrane of the present invention in the form of a hollow fiber membrane may further have a fluoropolymer layer or a resin layer of a resin other than the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer on the outer surface or the inner surface of the hollow fiber membrane formed by the above method.
The fluoropolymer layer or the resin layer can be formed by applying a composition or a resin solution to the outer surface or the inner surface of the hollow fiber membrane. A method of applying the composition or the resin solution to the outer surface of the hollow fiber membrane is preferably immersing the hollow fiber membrane in the composition or the resin solution or dropping the composition or the resin solution onto the hollow fiber membrane. A method of applying the composition or the resin solution to the inner surface of the hollow fiber membrane is preferably injecting the composition or the resin solution into the hollow fiber membrane. The amount of the composition or the resin solution to be applied can preferably be controlled by a method of controlling the amount itself of the composition or the resin solution to be applied, as well as a method of partially scraping off or blowing with an air knife the composition or the resin solution after immersing the porous membrane in the composition or the resin solution or applying the composition or the resin solution to the porous membrane, or a method of adjusting the concentration thereof upon application.
The porous polymer membrane in the form of a flat membrane can be produced by casting the composition and immersing the composition in a cooling bath or a solidification bath. Alternatively, such a membrane can be produced by ejecting the composition into a cooling bath or a solidification bath through a slit die.
The porous polymer membrane in the form of a composite membrane comprising a porous base can be produced by immersing a porous base in the composition or by applying the composition to at least one face of a porous base, for example.
The aforementioned production method can provide a porous polymer membrane having low contact angle. Still, if the water permeability is insufficient, the porous membrane produced by the above production method may be further stretched so that the porous polymer membrane of the present invention can be obtained.
The pore size of the porous polymer membrane can be controlled by, for example, mixing an additive for controlling the pore size with the composition, and then allowing the additive to be eluted during or after formation of the porous structure of the compound of the present invention, the fluorine-containing polymer. The additive may be made to remain in the porous membrane.
In each of the nonsolvent-induced phase separation and the thermally induced phase separation, the composition may contain an additive. Elution of the additive after formation of the porous structure enables control of the pore size of the porous polymer membrane. The additive may be made to remain in the porous membrane, if necessary.
Examples of the additive include organic compounds and inorganic compounds. The organic compounds are preferably those dissolved or uniformly dispersed in a solvent constituting the composition. They are also preferably those dissolved in a nonsolvent contained in the solidification liquid for nonsolvent-induced phase separation or a solvent contained in the cooling liquid for thermally induced phase separation.
Examples of the organic compounds include water-soluble polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene imine, polyacrylic acid, and dextran, surfactants such as Tween 40 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monopalmitate), glycerin, and saccharides.
The inorganic compounds are preferably water-soluble compounds. Examples thereof include calcium chloride, lithium chloride, and barium sulfate.
The average pore size on the surface can also be controlled by controlling the phase separation rate in accordance with the type, concentration, and temperature of a nonsolvent in the solidification liquid without any additive. In general, the higher the phase separation rate is, the smaller the average pore size on the surface is, whereas the lower the rate is, the larger the size is. Addition of a nonsolvent to the composition is also effective to control the phase separation rate.
In order to achieve hydrophilization, to control phase separation, and to improve mechanical strength, the composition may further contain any additives such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethyl methacrylate resin, montmorillonite, SiO2, TiO2, CaCO3, and polytetrafluoroethylene.
In order to improve the water permeability, the porous polymer membrane may be treated with an alkali. The alkali herein means a NaOH aqueous solution, a KOH aqueous solution, ammonia water, an amine solution, or the like. They may contain any alcohol such as ethanol and methanol, and organic solvents. The alkali preferably contains an alcohol, but it is not limited thereto.
By applying the compound of the present invention to the porous polymer membrane, the compound can form a coating to provide hydrophilicity. As the porous polymer membrane, those described above are able to be used.
Therefore, the present invention provides a membrane obtained by applying the compound of the present invention to the surface of the membrane of the other polymeric material.
The compound of the present invention may contain an organic solvent, and when the compound contains the organic solvent, it is possible to easily applied.
Examples of the organic solvent include the following solvents:
aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene and solvent naphtha;

This article can be produced, for example, as follows.
Firstly, the base material is provided. As mentioned above, the surface treatment agent of the present invention can be suitably applied to any base material as long as it has reactivity with a nitrileoxide group. The base material usable in the present invention may be composed of any suitable material such as a glass, a resin (may be a natural or synthetic resin such as a common plastic material, and may be in form of a plate, a film, or others), a metal (may be a simple substance of a metal such as aluminum, copper, or iron, or a complex such as alloy or the like), a ceramic, a semiconductor (silicon, germanium, or the like), a fiber (a fabric, a non-woven fabric, or the like), a fur, a leather, a wood, a pottery, a stone, or the like.
For example, when an article to be produced is an optical member, a material constituting the surface of the base material may be a material for an optical member, for example, a glass or a transparent plastic. For example, when an article to be produced is an optical member, any layer (or film) such as a hard coating layer or an antireflection layer may be formed on the surface (outermost layer) of the base material. As the antireflection layer, either a single antireflection layer or a multi antireflection layer may be used. Examples of an inorganic material usable in the antireflection layer include SiO2, SiO, ZrO2, TiO2, TiO, Ti2O3, Ti2O5, Al2O3, Ta2O5, CeO2, MgO, Y2O3, SnO2, MgF2, WO3, and the like. These inorganic materials may be used alone or in combination with two or more (for example, as a mixture). Furthermore, the base material may have an insulating layer, an adhesive layer, a protecting layer, a decorated frame layer (I-CON), an atomizing layer, a hard coating layer, a polarizing film, a phase difference film, a liquid crystal display module, and the like, depending on its specific specification.
The shape of the base material is not particularly limited. The region of the surface of the base material on which the surface-treating layer should be formed may be at least a part of the surface of the base material, and may be appropriately determined depending on use, the specific specification, and the like of the article to be produced.
The base material may be that of which at least the surface consists of a material originally having a group reactive with a nitrileoxide group. On the other hand, by pre-treating the base material, the group reactive with a nitrileoxide group may be introduced to the base material. For example, when the base material is a glass, the group reactive with a nitrileoxide group can be introduced to the base material by treating the base material with a piranha solution to express a hydroxyl group, and reacting this hydroxyl group for example with allyltrichlorosilane.
Next, the film of the above surface-treating agent of the present invention is formed on the surface of the base material, and the film is post-treated, as necessary, and thereby the surface-treating layer is formed from the surface-treating agent.
The formation of the film of the surface-treating agent of the present invention can be performed by applying the above surface-treating agent on the surface of the base material such that the surface-treating agent coats the surface. The method of coating is not particularly limited. For example, a wet coating method or a dry coating method can be used.
Examples of the wet coating method include dip coating, spin coating, flow coating, spray coating, roll coating, gravure coating, micro-gravure coating, bar coating, die coating, and a similar method.

The specific examples of the vacuum deposition include resistance heating, electron beam, high-frequency heating, ion beam, and a similar method. The specific examples of the CVD method include plasma-CVD, optical CVD, thermal CVD and a similar method.
Additionally, coating can be performed by an atmospheric pressure plasma method.
When the wet coating method is used, the surface-treating agent of the present invention is diluted with a solvent, and then it is applied to the surface of the base material. In view of stability of the fluorine-containing compound or the composition and volatile property of the solvent, the following solvents are preferably used: an aliphatic perfluorohydrocarbon having 5-12 carbon atoms (for example, perfluorohexane, perfluoromethylcyclohexane and perfluoro-1,3-dimethylcyclohexane); an aromatic polyfluorohydrocarbon (for example, bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene); an aliphatic polyfluorohydrocarbon; a hydrofluoroether (HFE) (for example, an alkyl perfluoroalkyl ether such as perfluoropropyl methyl ether (C3F7OCH3), perfluorobutyl methyl ether (C4F9OCH3), perfluorobutyl ethyl ether (C4F9OC2H5), and perfluorohexyl methyl ether (C2F5CF(OCH3)C3F7) (the perfluoroalkyl group and the alkyl group may be liner or branched)), and the like. These solvents may be used alone or as a mixture of 2 or more compound. Among them, the hydrofluoroether is preferable, perfluorobutyl methyl ether (C4F9OCH3) and/or perfluorobutyl ethyl ether (C4F9OC2H5) are particularly preferable.
After forming the film of the surface treatment agent by using the above method, if necessary, post-treatment may be performed. Examples of the post-treatment include, but are not particularly limited to, for example heating to 40-150° C., for example 60-100° C.
As described above, the surface-treating layer derived from the film of the surface-treating agent of the present invention is formed on the surface of the base material to produce the article of the present invention.
Therefore, the surface treatment agent can be suitably used to form the surface-treating layer on an outermost layer of an optical material. Examples of the optical material include preferably a variety of optical materials: for example, displays such as a cathode ray tube (CRT; for example, TV, personal computer monitor), a liquid crystal display, a plasma display, an organic EL display, an inorganic thin-film EL dot matrix display, a rear projection display, a vacuum fluorescent display (VFD), a field emission display (FED; Field Emission Display), or a protective plate of such displays, or that in which these displays and protective plates have been subjected to antireflection treatment on their surface.
The article having the surface-treating layer obtained according to the present invention is not specifically limited to, but may be an optical member. Examples of the optical member include the followings: lens of glasses, or the like; a front surface protective plate, an antireflection plate, a polarizing plate, or an anti-glare plate on a display such as PDP and LCD; a touch panel sheet of an instrument such as a mobile phone or a personal digital assistance; a disk surface of an optical disk such as a Blu-ray disk, a DVD disk, a CD-R or MO; an optical fiber, and the like.
The thickness of the surface-treating layer is not specifically limited. For the optical member, the thickness of the surface-treating layer is within the range of 0.1-30 μm, preferably 0.5-20 μm, in view of optical performance, friction durability and antifouling property.
The surface-treating layer formed from the surface treatment agent of the present invention may have water-repellency, oil-repellency, antifouling property, surface slip property, water-proof property and/or high friction durability, thus may be suitably used as a functional thin film.

The above process is usually performed in the absence of a solvent. If necessary, for example, in order to improve the dispersibility of the compound of the present invention, a solvent may be used. The solvent is appropriately selected depending on the type of the raw material to be used and the low-temperature property rubber of interest, for example, the solvent includes a fluorine-containing solvent.
Since an untreated fluorine-containing rubber generally has a skeleton in which the molecular backbone is rigid, the untreated fluorine-containing rubber has insufficient molecular movement in a low temperature environment, as a result of which, sufficient elasticity cannot be obtained. However, by treating the fluorine-containing rubber with the compound of the present invention, the elasticity in the low temperature environment can be increased while maintaining other properties such as chemical resistance and heat resistance. it can be improved elasticity at low temperature environment. Although the present invention is not limited by theory, the reason for improving of elasticity property in the low temperature environment by treating the fluorine-containing rubber with the compound of the present invention may be considered as follows. The compound of the present invention may have a group having high molecular mobility and a flexible skeleton as a substituent, for example, a perfluoropolyalkylether group. By reacting the compound with the moiety (for example, double bond, triple bond) reactive with the fluorine-containing rubber and grafting them, the molecular mobility of fluorine rubber itself is increased, as a result, sufficient elasticity can be achieved in the low temperature environment. In addition, by applying a group having excellent chemical resistance and heat resistance as the substituent which the compound of the present invention, for example by applying a perfluoroalkylether group, the chemical resistance and heat resistance of the fluorine-containing rubber can be maintained.
The present invention provides a low temperature property rubber prepared by using the composition of the present invention.
In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention is used as a raw material of a liquid rubber.
The composition of the present invention used as the raw material of a liquid rubber (hereinafter, referred to as “Liquid rubber raw composition 1”) contains at least one polymer having a group of the formula (Ib) at the terminal of the main chain of the present invention.
By mixing Liquid rubber raw composition 1 with a composition containing a compound having an unsaturated bond (hereinafter, “Liquid rubber raw composition 2”), a click-reaction between the nitrileoxide group contained in the compound of the present invention and the unsaturated bond contained in the compound in Liquid rubber raw composition 2 occurs to produce a gel-like production (that is, a liquid rubber).
Examples of the compound having an unsaturated bond in contained in Liquid rubber raw composition 2 include, but are not limited to, one or more compounds of the formula:
<in-line-formulae>CH2═CH-(X)a-Rf2-(X)a-CH═CH2 </in-line-formulae>
wherein:
X is each independently -CH2-, -CH2O-, -CH2OCH2-, or -CH2-NR1-CO-;
Y is -CH2-;
Rf1 is a di-valent perfluoroalkylene group; and
a is each independently an integer of 0 or 1;
andone or more compounds of the formula:
<in-line-formulae>Rf2-(X)a-CH═CH2 </in-line-formulae>
wherein:
X is each independently -CH2-, -CH2O-, -CH2OCH2- or -CH2-NR1-CO-;
Y is -CH2-:
Rf2 is a perfluoropolyalkyl group; and
a is each independently an integer of 0 or 1.
Specific examples of the compound having an unsaturated bond contained in Liquid rubber raw composition 2 include, for example, triallyl isocyanurate (TAIC), triallyl trimellitate, diallyl phthalate, triallyl phosphite, N,N-diallyl acrylamide, 1,6-vinyl dodecafluorohexane, bismaleimide, triallyl phosphate, and the like.
In the conventional producing of a liquid rubber, a metal catalyst such as a platinum compound was essential. However, the present invention has an advantage to be able to produce a liquid rubber simply by mixing Liquid rubber raw composition 1 and Liquid rubber raw composition 2. By using the composition of the present invention, a catalyst-free liquid rubber can be produced. For example, such liquid rubber can be suitably used in the semiconductor manufacturing process on which the presence of the metal can adversely affect.
In the conventional producing of a liquid rubber, a curing reaction is performed by hydrosililation, and a liquid rubber obtained by this method contains Si atom. This backbone containing Si atom has low resistance against a fluorine active species (a fluorine gas, a fluorine plasma, a fluorine radical) and is not suitable for use in a step in which the active species is generated in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Since the liquid rubber obtained by using the composition of the present invention is produced without using a backbone containing Si atom, the liquid rubber containing no Si atom can be easily produced if necessary. In this point, the present invention is advantageous.
In addition, the present invention provides a liquid rubber produced by using the composition of the present invention.
