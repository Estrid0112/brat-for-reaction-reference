Background
Cancer, also known as malignant tumor, is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal cell proliferation, metastasis, high incidence and high mortality, and is one of the malignant diseases that threaten human health and cause death. Research data show that in 2008, there were 12.7 million cancer patients, in which the number of death was up to 700 million. And 20% of new cases of tumor in the world occur in China, and 24% of tumor-caused death occurs in China. Without effective prevention or better treatment options, it is estimated that by 2030 there will be 26 million new cases of cancer worldwide each year and the number of cancer-caused deaths will reach 17 million. Among the existing cancers, lung cancer is the malignant tumor with the highest morbidity and mortality in the world, wherein non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for more than 80% of lung cancer patients. According to World Health Organization (WHO), it is predicted that by 2025, annual increase of new cases of lung cancer will be more than 1 million in China. Once diagnosed as having lung cancer, patients have only little prospect for survival, and 5-year survival rate of less than 15%.
Since the 1980s, molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and development have been clear with deep researches on tumor molecular biology. Among many cancer-inducing factors, some of highly expressed protein kinases in cancer cells caused by gene mutations are one of major factors leading to abnormal signal transduction pathways. Protein, tyrosine kinase is an important factor in signal transmission process, involved in a series of cell activities, and closely related to cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. It catalyzes the transfer of Î³-phosphate group of ATP to tyrosine residues of many important proteins and phosphorylates phenolic hydroxyl, thereby transferring signals. Therefore, for developing anti-tumor drugs, it is an effective research strategy to develop selective protein kinase inhibitors to block or regulate diseases caused by these abnormal signaling pathways. Among many tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) is an indispensable and important part. EGFR consists of 1186 amino acids and encodes a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 170-kDa. EGFR can mediate multiple signal transduction pathways and transmit extracellular signals into cells, which plays an important regulatory role in the proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of normal and tumor cells (Cell, 2000, 100, 113-127). EGFR is a constitutively expressed component in many normal epithelial tissues, such as the skin and hair follicles, while overexpressed or highly expressed in most solid tumors. For example, in lung cancer, the expression rate of EGFR reaches 40 to 80%. Therefore, the purpose of treating lung cancer can be achieved by selectively inhibiting EGFR and interfering with its signal transduction pathways, which will open up a feasible way for targeted treatment of lung cancer.
In clinical practice, EGFR-targeting drugs such as Iressa, Tarceva, etc in combination with traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy were proved to be very effective in the treatment of lung cancer. However, clinical practice shows that most patients with non-small cell lung cancer develop acquired resistance within 6-12 months after treatment with Gefitinib or Erlotinib. Approximately 50% of cases of resistance are related to mutation in one amino acid residue in EGFR kinase domain (mutation of threonine residue at position 790 to methionine, T790M) (The New England Journal of Medicine, 2005, 352, 786-792). T790M mutation results in steric hindrance when an inhibitor binds to EGFR or increases the affinity of EGFR to ATP, so that the anticancer effects of such reversibly-binding competitive inhibitors are greatly reduced. Drug resistance not only reduces the patient's sensitivity to drugs, but also greatly reduces the quality of lives of cancer patients. For overcoming the resistance induced by T790M mutation, a series of irreversible ATP competitive inhibitors (such as CI-1033, HKI-272, PF00299804, etc.) have entered the clinical research stage. The irreversible inhibitors contain a Michael acceptor fragment that forms a covalent bond with a conserved amino acid residue (Cys797) at the ATP binding site of EGFR, thereby resulting in stronger EGFR-binding affinity as compared with the reversible inhibitor. However, this type of drugs exhibit poor selectivity to both wild-type and mutant EGFR, therefore maximal tolerated dose (MTD) thereof is low, and clinical effects are less effective. In addition, some compounds exhibt poor druggability despite good activity, which limits their clinical application.
Therefore, it is of great clinical significance and application prospects for studying and developing EGFR-targeted drugs that can selectively inhibit T790M mutation and overcome clinical resistance

Compounds of the present invention
The inventors have synthesized a series of candidates possessing EGFR inhibitory activity. A series of 7(8H)-pteridinone compounds with novel structure were designed and synthesized through optimization of structure of the obtained candidate compounds, and structurally characterized. Biological activities and physical-chemical properties of this series of compounds were tested, and a series of compounds capable of selectively inhibiting EGFR T790M mutation and possessing good druggability were obtained. Among these compounds, IC50 values of inhibitory activity of compound ZW-39 on EGFR-T790M/L858R kinase was 3.9 nM, IC50 values of inhibiting proliferation of H1975 cells (non-small cell lung cancer cells, EGFR-T790M / L858R) was 9 nM, and its solubility in water (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) was 1367 Âµg/mL.

Assay on bioactivity: Activity test on molecular level (kinase)
EGFR-TK catalyses transfer of one phosphate group of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to polypeptide substrate, poly(Glu, Tyr)4: 1, which is labeled with two fluorescent groups coumarin and fluorescein. Based on fluorescence energy resonance transfer (FRET) method, EGFR-TK catalyzes a reaction of ATP, resulting in two fluorescent groups approaching, exciting donator (coumarin) at 400 nM, releasing part of energy (emission wavelength at 445 nM), and transferring other part of energy to fluorescein (emission wavelength at 520 nM). Different compounds exhibited different inhibition-degrees on EGFR-TK, leading to different phosphorylation-degrees of substrate, so that the inhibition ratio of different compounds can be calculated by measuring the ratio of phosphorylation percentage of substrate catalyzed by an enzyme.
1. Experiment steps:
2.5 ÂµL of Test Compounds, 5 ÂµL Kinase / Peptide Substrate Mixture, 2.5 ÂµL ATP Solution were added into a 384-well plate, and the 10 ÂµL of reaction system was shaken for 30s and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. 5 ÂµL of Development Solution was added and the 15 ÂµL of reaction system was shaken for 30s, and incubated at room temperature for 1h. 5 ÂµL of Stop Reagent was added, the reaction system in a total volume of 20 ÂµL was shaken for 30s, and a microplate reader was used to detect fluorescence signals at excitation wavelength of 400 nm and emission wavelength of 445 nm and 520 nm, respectively. The inhibitory rates of the compounds at 7 concentration gradients were determined and the IC50 value for each compound was calculated by Origin 8.0 fitting curve.Ppositive controls were used during the experiment to confirm the feasibility of the reaction system, and each experiment was performed in triplicate.

In Vitro Enzyme Activity Assay: Wild type and various mutant (T790M, L858 / T790M) EGFR were purchased from Invitrogen. 10 concentration gradients from 5.1 Ã 10-11 mol / L to 1.0 Ã 10-6 mol / L were set for all compounds to be tested.
The concentration of different kinases was determined by optimization experiments and the corresponding concentrations were: EGFR (PV3872, Invitrogen) 0.287 Âµg/ÂµL, EGFR-T790M (PV4803, Invitrogen) 0.174 Âµg/ÂµL, EGFR-L858R/T790M (PV4879, Invitrogen) 0.055 Âµg/ÂµL. Compounds were diluted in DMSO for three times from 5.1x10-9 M to 1x10-4 M. 4 ÂµL of the compound was dissolved in 96 ÂµL of water to obtain a 4x compound solution. 40 ÂµM ATP was dissolved in 1.33x kinase buffer and the kinase / peptide mixture contained 2x kinase, 4 ÂµM tyrosine tetrapeptide for use. The 10 ÂµL kinase reaction consisted of 2.5 ÂµL compound solution, 5 ÂµL kinase / peptide mix, 2.5 ÂµL ATP solution. 10 ÂµL of kinase reaction included 2.5 ÂµL of compound solution, 5 ÂµL of kinase / peptide mixture, 2.5 ÂµL of ATP solution. 5 ÂµL of phosphorylated peptide solution, instead of the kinase / peptide mixture, was used as a 100% phosphorylation control. 2.5 ÂµL of 1.33x kinase buffer, instead of ATP solution was used as a 100% inhibition control and 2.5 ÂµL of 4% DMSO, instead of compound solution was used as a 0% inhibition control. The plates were thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1.5 hours. 5 ÂµL of Development Solution was added into each well and then incubated for another 1 hour at room temperature, unphosphorylated peptides were cleaved during this period. Finally, 5 ÂµL Stop Reagent was added to quench the reaction. The plates were measured with EnVision Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). The experimental data were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.0. Each experiment was repeated more than 3 times.

Cell activity test (Inhibitory activity on cell proliferation)
Inhibition Analysis on Cell Proliferation and Growth: H1975 (non-small cell lung cancer cells, EGFRL858R / T790M), A431 (non-small cell lung cancer cells, EGFR wild type) cells were obtained from the ATCC. Cell proliferation activity was assessed by MTS assay. Cells were exposed to processing conditions for 72 hours and the number of cells used in each experiment for each cell line was adjusted based on absorbance values (absorbance values at 490 nm, 1.3-2.2). Six concentration gradients (0.1 nM - 10 ÂµM) were set for the compounds to be tested, wherein at least 6 sets of parallel controls for each concentration were used.
H1975, A431 cells were cultured in corresponding media, and cells were passaged at least twice after resuscitation and then used for experiments. Cells at Log phase were trypsinized and resuspended in culture medium. H1975 (1000 cells per well), A431 (2000 cells per well) were seeded in 96-well plates in a volume of 100 ÂµL; and 6 sets of parallel controls and 7 columns were set. The plate was placed in a 37Â°C 5% CO2 incubator overnight. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO to a concentration of 10 ÂµM per liter, and then the concentration was gradually diluted to 10 ÂµM, 1 ÂµM, 0.1 ÂµM, 0.01 ÂµM, 0.001 ÂµM, 0.0001 ÂµM per liter, respectively. 2 ÂµL of the compound solution was added to 998 ÂµL of medium, and the mixture was thoroughly mixed. 100 ÂµL of the mixture was added to a 96-well plate. 2 ÂµL of DMSO, instead of compound solution was used as a 0% inhibition control. After culturing for 68 hours, 20 ÂµL of MTT (5 mg / mL) was added. After 4 hours, the supernatant was discarded and 150 ÂµL of DMSO was added. After shaking for 10 minutes, the plate was read with Synergy HT (Bio TeK) (OD490). Data were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 and IC50 values were obtained using a non-linear regression model of dose response curve.
Determination of solubility in water: About 2 mg of the compound to be tested was weighed into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and 1 mL of PBS buffer (20 mM, pH = 6.8) was added, sonicated for 5 minutes (if the compound was completely dissolved, 2 mg of the compound was added again), and shaken overnight. The suspension was filtered through a 0.22 Âµm PVDF filter, and then diluted to an appropriate concentration with methanol (v = 50%) and PBS (v = 50%), and the absorbance was measured by a UV spectrophotometer. About 3 mg of compound was accurately weighed, and methanol was added for preparing a stock solution of 1 mg / mL. The above stock solution was taken and prepared into a solution at concentrations of 0.05, 0.04, 0.03, 0.02 and 0.01 mg / mL, respectively, PBS solution (v = 50%) was added and the absorbance value was measured. Concentration c (mg / mL) as horizontal ordinate vs absorbance A as longitudinal coordinate was plotted, and a line was fitted for obtaining a standard curve (correlation coefficient greater than 0.998). The solubility of a compound in water was calculated from the standard curve.
Test results are shown in following Table 1.

Example 4
1. H1975 cell xenograft tumor assay: Pharmacodynamic evaluation in animals
Purpose of experiment: H1975 transplanted BALB/c nude mice were orally administered (PO) with a substance to be tested for 14 consecutive days. The body weight and tumor size of nude mice were observed and recorded. The changes of physiological activity of nude mice after administration were observed for evaluating antineoplastic efficacy.
1.1 Preparation of H1975 cell
H1975 cells were obtained from Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica. Cells were cultured in 1640 + 10% FBS (Gibco) at 37Â°C in a constant-temperature carbon dioxide incubator with 5% CO2 concentration. Cells were fluid-changed and passaged for one time every 2-3 days and expanded. When the desired amount of cells was achieved, transplantation of cells was performed. Before transplantation, cell viability should be maintained above 90%, serum-free 1640 medium was used for suspending cells, and the cell concentration in suspension was 20 million / ml.
1.2 Modeling of H1975 xenograft tumor
40 male BALB/c nude mice, aged 4-5 weeks and weighing 17-23 g, were purchased from Shanghai Bikai, placed in an animal room environment for 2-3 days, and then seeded with cells. Cell suspension was subcutaneously injected at forelimb of the nude mouse rich in capillaries, and each mouse was injected with 0.1 mL of cell suspension.
Experimental conditions in animal room:Laboratory temperature: 23 Â± 3Â°CLaboratory humidity: 30-60%12 hours day-night rhythm
In about 2-3 weeks, xenograft tumor can be found, and mice were grouped and administered with a drug when average size of tumor reaching 300mm3.
1.3 Formulation of substance to be tested
Appropriate amount of a substance to be tested was weighed, suspended in 14 mL of DMSO-PEG400 saline solution (DMSO: PEG400: saline = 1:30:69) respectively, formulated according to the following table, suspended or dissolved by ultrasonic wave, filled into vials and sealed, and reserved in a 4Â°C refrigerator for further use.

1.4 Dosage and mode of administration
The mice were administered with a dosage of 0.1ml / 25g through oral gavage once a day, and the mice were observed for their status and abnormalities. The length and width of a tumor and body weight of a mouse were recorded at least twice a week. The tumor size is calculated as V = 0.5 * length * width * width.
Figure 1 shows pharmacodynamic evaluation of a series of compounds: after orally administered to nude mice of H1975 cell xenograft model for 14 days, Compound 14 exhibited superior efficacy over CO-1686.
Figure 2 shows pharmacodynamics comparison between Compound 14 and CO-1686 and AZD9291: Compound 14 (10 mg/kg) exhibited better efficacy over CO-1686 (50 mg/kg), Compound 14 (25 mg/kg) exhibited comparable efficacy to AZD9291 (25 mg/kg), both of which can effectively reduce the size of a tumor, and the mice still live and the tumor did not recur after administration was stopped for 1 month.
2. A431 cell xenograft tumor assay:
Purpose of experiment: A431 xenograft tumor BALB/c nude mice were orally administered (PO) with a substance to be tested for 14 consecutive days. The body weight and tumor size of nude mice were observed and recorded. The changes of physiological activity of nude mice after administration were observed for evaluating antineoplastic efficacy.
2.1 Preparation of A431 cell
A431 cells belong to our laboratory, and in October 2015 confirmed by STR experiment. Cells were cultured in 1640 + 10% FBS (Gibco) at 37Â°C in a constant-temperature carbon dioxide incubator with 5% CO2 concentration. Cells were fluid-changed and passaged for one time every 2-3 days and expanded. When the desired amount of cells was achieved, transplantation of cells was performed. Before transplantation, cell viability should be maintained above 90%, serum-free 1640 medium was used for suspending cells, and the cell concentration in suspension was 20 million/ml.

The length and width of a tumor and body weight of a mouse were recorded at least twice a week. The tumor size is calculated as V = 0.5 * length * width * width.
Figure 3 shows that compound 14 exhibited better selectivity on wild-type EGFR. Nude mice of EGFR wild-type A431 cell xenograft model were administered for 14 days by oral administration, compound 14 (25 mg/kg) exhibited performance comparable to the same dose of AZD9291, that is, the size of the tumor did not substatially change, and the selectivity was significantly better than afatinib (a medicament of 2nd generation).
Example 4
1. Acute Toxicity Evaluation of Compound: 10 times and higher dose of AZD9291 were selected for Acute toxicity test in ICR mice. In contrast, ZW-W-33 at 100 mg / kg, 250 mg / kg, and 500 mg / kg showed comparable toxicity to the same dose of AZD9291 with a slight decrease in body weight.Figure 4 shows the toxicity assessment of Compound 14 and AZD9291.2. Figure 5 shows the pathological analysis of tumor-bearing mice after 14 consecutive days of administration.
Conclusion: after long-term (14 days) administration of continuous treatment dose, no obvious pathological change was observed in all organs, and side effects were comparable to those of the same dose of positive drug AZD9291.
