The invention relates to substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides or salts thereof and to the use thereof for enhancing stress tolerance in plants to abiotic stress, and for enhancing plant growth and/or for increasing plant yield.
It is known that particular arylsulfonamides, for example 2-cyanobenzenesulfonamides, have insecticidal properties (cf., for example, EP0033984 and WO 2005/035486, WO 2006/056433, WO 2007/060220). 2-Cyanobenzenesulfonamides with particular heterocyclic substituents are described in EP 2065370. It is further known that particular aryl- and heteroaryl-substituted sulfonamides can be used as active ingredients to counter abiotic plant stress (cf. WO 2011/113861). The action of particular aryl-, heteroaryl- and benzylsulfonamidocarboxylic acids, -carboxylic esters, -carboxamides and -carbonitriles against abiotic plant stress is described in WO 2012/089721 and WO 2012/089722.
The preparation of sulfamidoalkanecarboxylic acids and sulfamidoalkanecarbonitriles is described in DE 847006. The use of selected arylsulfonamides having alkylcarboxyl substituents as growth regulators especially for limiting the longitudinal growth of rice and wheat plants with the aim of minimizing weather-related lodging is described in DE 2544859, while the fungicidal action of certain N-cyanoalkylsulfonamides is described in EP 176327. It is also known that substituted N-sulfonylaminoacetonitriles can be used to control parasites in warm-blooded animals (cf. WO 2004/000798). The use of 1-(4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-oxo-1-propyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)methanesulfonamide to counter drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana and soya is described in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2013, 110(29), 12132-12137. The use of 1-(4-methylphenyl)-N-(2-oxo-1-propyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)methanesulfonamide for enhancing the stress tolerance of plants is likewise described in CN 104170823. Further 1-aryl-N-(2-oxo-1-alkyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)methanesulfonamides having an alkyl group in the N-tetrahydroquinolinyl unit which is unbranched or branched but has no further substitution are described in WO 2013/148339. WO 2013/148339 likewise describes the agonistic effect of the substances in question on abscisic acid receptors. WO 2013/148339 further claims, but without substantiation, (2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)methanesulfonamides with unsubstituted N-cycloalkyl radicals. (2-Oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)sulfonamides with substituted N-cycloalkyl radicals, by contrast, are not described in WO2013/148339.
It is also known that substituted arylsulfonamides (cf., for example, WO 2009/105774, WO 2006/124875, WO 96/36595) and substituted hetarylsulfonamides (cf. WO 2009/113600, WO 2007/122219) can be used as active pharmaceutical ingredients. WO 2003/007931 likewise describes the pharmaceutical use of substituted naphthylsulfonamides, while Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2010, 45, 1760 describes naphthylsulfonyl-substituted glutaminamides and their antitumor action. Effects on cancer stem cells are also described in WO 2013/130603. In addition, it is known that pyrrolidinyl-substituted arylsulfonamides can be used as cathepsin C inhibitors in the treatment of respiratory disorders (WO 2009/026197) or as antiinfective agents in the treatment of hepatitis C (WO 2007/092588). The pharmaceutical use of N-arylsulfonyl derivatives of various other amino acids, for example as urokinase inhibitors (cf. WO 2000/05214), as active ingredients for treatment of diabetes (cf. WO 2003/091211), as analgesics (cf. WO 2008/131947) and as γ-secretase modulators (cf. WO 2010/108067) has likewise been described.
It is likewise known that particular substituted benzoxazinylsulfonamides can be used as active pharmaceutical ingredients, for example as regulators of mineralocorticoid receptors (cf. JP 2009051830, WO 2007/089034). The use of amidinophenylpropionyl-substituted tetrahydroquinolines as active antithrombotic ingredients is described in DE 19727117. The use of 2-oxoquinoline derivatives as active immunomodulating ingredients has likewise been described (cf. JP 07252228). Furthermore, it is known that oxotetrahydroquinolinylsulfonamides can be used as Rho kinase inhibitors (cf. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 43, 1730).
It is known that plants can react with specific or unspecific defense mechanisms to natural stress conditions, for example cold, heat, drought stress (stress caused by aridity and/or lack of water), injury, pathogenic attack (viruses, bacteria, fungi, insects) etc., but also to herbicides [Pflanzenbiochemie [Plant Biochemistry], p. 393-462, Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, Heidelberg, Berlin, Oxford, Hans W. Heldt, 1996.; Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants, p. 1102-1203, American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, Md., eds. Buchanan, Gruissem, Jones, 2000].
Numerous proteins in plants, and the genes that code for them, which are involved in defense reactions to abiotic stress (for example cold, heat, drought, salt, flooding) are known. Some of these form part of signal transduction chains (e.g. transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases) or cause a physiological response of the plant cell (e.g. ion transport, deactivation of reactive oxygen species). The signaling chain genes of the abiotic stress reaction include inter alia transcription factors of the DREB and CBF classes (Jaglo-Ottosen et al., 1998, Science 280: 104-106). Phosphatases of the ATPK and MP2C type are involved in the reaction to salt stress. In addition, in the event of salt stress, the biosynthesis of osmolytes such as proline or sucrose is frequently activated. This involves, for example, sucrose synthase and proline transporters (Hasegawa et al., 2000, Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol 51: 463-499). The stress defense of the plants to cold and drought uses some of the same molecular mechanisms. There is a known accumulation of what are called late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA proteins), which include the dehydrins as an important class (Ingram and Bartels, 1996, Annu Rev Plant Physiol Plant Mol Biol 47: 277-403, Close, 1997, Physiol Plant 100: 291-296). These are chaperones which stabilize vesicles, proteins and membrane structures in stressed plants (Bray, 1993, Plant Physiol 103: 1035-1040). In addition, there is frequently induction of aldehyde dehydrogenases, which deactivate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) which form in the event of oxidative stress (Kirch et al., 2005, Plant Mol Biol 57: 315-332). Heat shock factors (HSF) and heat shock proteins (HSP) are activated in the event of heat stress and play a similar role here as chaperones to that of dehydrins in the event of cold and drought stress (Yu et al., 2005, Mol Cells 19: 328-333).
A number of signaling substances which are endogenous to plants and are involved in stress tolerance or pathogenic defense are already known. Mention should be made here, for example, of salicylic acid, benzoic acid, jasmonic acid or ethylene [Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants, p. 850-929, American Society of Plant Physiologists, Rockville, Md., eds. Buchanan, Gruissem, Jones, 2000]. Some of these substances or the stable synthetic derivatives and derived structures thereof are also effective on external application to plants or in seed dressing, and activate defense reactions which cause elevated stress tolerance or pathogen tolerance of the plant [Sembdner, and Parthier, 1993, Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 44: 569-589].
It is also known that chemical substances can increase the tolerance of plants to abiotic stress. Such substances are applied either by seed dressing, by leaf spraying or by soil treatment. For instance, an increase in the abiotic stress tolerance of crop plants by treatment with elicitors of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or abscisic acid derivatives is described (Schading and Wei, WO 2000/28055; Abrams and Gusta, U.S. Pat. No. 5,201,931; Abrams et al., WO 97/23441, Churchill et al., 1998, Plant Growth Regul 25: 35-45). In addition, effects of growth regulators on the stress tolerance of crop plants have been described (Morrison and Andrews, 1992, J Plant Growth Regul 11: 113-117, RD-259027). In this context, it is likewise known that a growth-regulating naphthylsulfonamide (4-bromo-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)naphthalene-1-sulfonamide) influences the germination of plant seeds in the same way as abscisic acid (Park et al. Science 2009, 324, 1068-1071). Furthermore, in biochemical receptor tests a naphthylsulfamidocarboxylic acid (N-[(4-bromo-1-naphthyl)sulfonyl]-5-methoxynorvaline) shows a mode of action comparable to 4-bromo-N-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)naphthalene-1-sulfonamide (Melcher et al. Nature Structural & Molecular Biology 2010, 17, 1102-1108). It is also known that a further naphthylsulfonamide, N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonamide, influences the calcium level in plants which have been exposed to cold shock (Cholewa et al. Can. J. Botany 1997, 75, 375-382).
Similar effects are also observed on application of fungicides, especially from the group of the strobilurins or of the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and are frequently also accompanied by an increase in yield (Draber et al., DE 3534948, Bartlett et al., 2002, Pest Manag Sci 60: 309). It is likewise known that the herbicide glyphosate in low dosage stimulates the growth of some plant species (Cedergreen, Env. Pollution 2008, 156, 1099).
In the event of osmotic stress, a protective effect has been observed as a result of application of osmolytes, for example glycine betaine or the biochemical precursors thereof, e.g. choline derivatives (Chen et al., 2000, Plant Cell Environ 23: 609-618, Bergmann et al., DE 4103253). The effect of antioxidants, for example naphthols and xanthines, to increase abiotic stress tolerance in plants has also already been described (Bergmann et al., DD 277832, Bergmann et al., DD 277835). However, the molecular causes of the antistress action of these substances are largely unknown.
It is also known that the tolerance of plants to abiotic stress can be increased by a modification of the activity of endogenous poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARP) or poly-(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARG) (de Block et al., The Plant Journal, 2004, 41, 95; Levine et al., FEBS Lett. 1998, 440, 1; WO 00/04173; WO 2004/090140).
It is thus known that plants possess several endogenous reaction mechanisms which can bring about an effective defense against a wide variety of different harmful organisms and/or natural abiotic stress. Since the environmental and economic demands on modern plant treatment compositions are increasing constantly, for example with respect to their toxicity, selectivity, application rate, formation of residues and favorable manufacture, there is a constant need to develop novel plant treatment compositions which have advantages over those known, at least in some areas.
It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds which further increase tolerance to abiotic stress in plants, bring about invigoration of plant growth and/or contribute to an increase in plant yield. In this context, tolerance to abiotic stress is understood to mean, for example, tolerance to cold, heat and drought stress (stress caused by drought and/or lack of water), salts and flooding.
Surprisingly, it has now been found that substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides can be used to enhance stress tolerance in plants to abiotic stress, and to enhance plant growth and/or to increase plant yield.
The present invention accordingly provides substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I) or salts thereof

The compounds of the general formula (I) can form salts by addition of a suitable inorganic or organic acid, for example mineral acids, for example HCl, HBr, H2SO4, H3PO4 or HNO3, or organic acids, for example carboxylic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid or salicylic acid or sulfonic acids, for example p-toluenesulfonic acid, onto a basic group, for example amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, piperidino, morpholino or pyridino. In such a case, these salts will comprise the conjugate base of the acid as the anion. Suitable substituents in deprotonated form, for example sulfonic acids, particular sulfonamides or carboxylic acids, are capable of forming internal salts with groups, such as amino groups, which are themselves protonatable. Salts may also be formed by action of a base on compounds of the general formula (I). Examples of suitable bases are organic amines such as trialkylamines, morpholine, piperidine and pyridine, and the hydroxides, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates of ammonium, alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, especially sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate and potassium hydrogencarbonate. These salts are compounds in which the acidic hydrogen is replaced by an agriculturally suitable cation, for example metal salts, especially alkali metal salts or alkaline earth metal salts, in particular sodium and potassium salts, or else ammonium salts, salts with organic amines or quaternary ammonium salts, for example with cations of the formula [NRaRbRcRd]+ in which Ra to Rd are each independently an organic radical, especially alkyl, aryl, aralkyl or alkylaryl. Also suitable are alkylsulfonium and alkylsulfoxonium salts, such as (C1-C4)-trialkylsulfonium and (C1-C4)-trialkylsulfoxonium salts.
The compounds of the formula (I) used in accordance with the invention and the salts thereof are referred to hereinafter as “compounds of the general formula (I)”.

When a base structure is substituted “by one or more radicals” from a list of radicals (=group) or a generically defined group of radicals, this in each case includes simultaneous substitution by a plurality of identical and/or structurally different radicals.
In the case of a partly or fully saturated nitrogen heterocycle, this may be joined to the remainder of the molecule either via carbon or via the nitrogen.
Suitable substituents for a substituted heterocyclic radical are the substituents specified further down, and additionally also oxo and thioxo. The oxo group as a substituent on a ring carbon atom is then, for example, a carbonyl group in the heterocyclic ring. As a result, lactones and lactams are preferably also included. The oxo group may also occur on the ring heteroatoms, which may exist in different oxidation states, for example in the case of N and S, and in that case form, for example, the divalent -N(O)-, -S(O)- (also SO for short) and -S(O)2- (also SO2 for short) groups in the heterocyclic ring. In the case of -N(O)- and -S(O)- groups, both enantiomers in each case are included.

The term “halogen” denotes, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. If the term is used for a radical, “halogen” denotes, for example, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom.
According to the invention, “alkyl” denotes a straight-chain or branched open-chain, saturated hydrocarbon radical which is optionally mono- or polysubstituted. Preferred substituents are halogen atoms, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, cyano, alkylthio, haloalkylthio, amino or nitro groups, particular preference being given to methoxy, methyl, fluoroalkyl, cyano, nitro, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The prefix “bis” also includes the combination of different alkyl radicals, e.g. methyl(ethyl) or ethyl(methyl).
“Haloalkyl”, “-alkenyl” and “-alkynyl” respectively denote alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl partly or fully substituted by identical or different halogen atoms, for example monohaloalkyl such as CH2CH2Cl, CH2CH2Br, CHClCH3, CH2Cl, CH2F; perhaloalkyl such as CCl3, CClF2, CFCl2, CF2CClF2, CF2CClFCF3, polyhaloalkyl such as CH2CHFCl, CF2CClFH, CF2CBrFH, CH2CF3, the term perhaloalkyl also encompasses the term perfluoroalkyl.
Partly fluorinated alkyl denotes a straight-chain or branched, saturated hydrocarbon which is mono- or polysubstituted by fluorine, where the fluorine atoms in question may be present as substituents on one or more different carbon atoms of the straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon chain, for example CHFCH3, CH2CH2F, CH2CH2CF3, CHF2, CH2F, CHFCF2CF3.
Partly fluorinated haloalkyl denotes a straight-chain or branched, saturated hydrocarbon which is substituted by different halogen atoms with at least one fluorine atom, where any other halogen atoms optionally present are selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine or bromine, iodine. The corresponding halogen atoms may be present as substituents on one or more different carbon atoms of the straight-chain or branched hydrocarbon chain. Partly fluorinated haloalkyl also includes full substitution of the straight or branched chain by halogen including at least one fluorine atom.
Haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF3, OCHF2, OCH2F, OCF2CF3, OCH2CF3 and OCH2CH2Cl, the situation is equivalent for haloalkenyl and other halogen-substituted radicals.
The expression “(C1-C4)-alkyl” mentioned here by way of example is a brief notation for straight-chain or branched alkyl having one to 4 carbon atoms according to the range stated for carbon atoms, i.e. encompasses the methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methylpropyl or tert-butyl radicals. General alkyl radicals with a larger specified range of carbon atoms, e.g. “(C1-C6)-alkyl”, correspondingly also encompass straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals with a greater number of carbon atoms, i.e. according to the example also the alkyl radicals having 5 and 6 carbon atoms.
Unless stated specifically, preference is given to the lower carbon skeletons, for example having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms in the case of unsaturated groups, in the case of the hydrocarbyl radicals such as alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals, including in composite radicals. Alkyl radicals, including in composite radicals such as alkoxy, haloalkyl, etc., are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl or i-propyl, n-, t- or 2-butyl, pentyls, hexyls such as n-hexyl, i-hexyl and 1,3-dimethylbutyl, heptyls such as n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl and 1,4-dimethylpentyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals are defined as the possible unsaturated radicals corresponding to the alkyl radicals, where at least one double bond or triple bond is present.

In the case of optionally substituted cycloalkyl, cyclic systems with substituents are included, also including substituents with a double bond on the cycloalkyl radical, for example an alkylidene group such as methylidene. In the case of optionally substituted cycloalkyl, polycyclic aliphatic systems are also included, for example bicyclo[1.1.0]butan-1-yl, bicyclo[1.1.0]butan-2-yl, bicyclo[2.1.0]pentan-1-yl, bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-yl, bicyclo[2.1.0]pentan-2-yl, bicyclo[2.1.0]pentan-5-yl, bicyclo[2.1.1]hexyl, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl, bicyclo[2.2.2]octan-2-yl, bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-2-yl, bicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-2-yl, adamantan-1-yl and adamantan-2-yl, but also systems such as 1,1'-bi(cyclopropyl)-1-yl, 1,1'-bi(cyclopropyl)-2-yl, for example. The term “(C3-C7)-cycloalkyl” is a brief notation for cycloalkyl having three to 7 carbon atoms, corresponding to the range specified for carbon atoms.
In the case of substituted cycloalkyl, spirocyclic aliphatic systems are also included, for example spiro[2.2]pent-1-yl, spiro[2.3]hex-1-yl, spiro[2.3]hex-4-yl, 3-spiro[2.3]hex-5-yl, spiro[3.3]hept-1-yl, spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl.
“Cycloalkenyl” denotes a carbocyclic, nonaromatic, partly unsaturated ring system having preferably 4-8 carbon atoms, e.g. 1-cyclobutenyl, 2-cyclobutenyl, 1-cyclopentenyl, 2-cyclopentenyl, 3-cyclopentenyl, or 1-cyclohexenyl, 2-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, 1,3-cyclohexadienyl or 1,4-cyclohexadienyl, also including substituents with a double bond on the cycloalkenyl radical, for example an alkylidene group such as methylidene. In the case of optionally substituted cycloalkenyl, the elucidations for substituted cycloalkyl apply correspondingly.
The term “alkylidene”, also, for example, in the form (C1-C10)-alkylidene, means the radical of a straight-chain or branched open-chain hydrocarbon radical which is attached via a double bond. Possible bonding sites for alkylidene are naturally only positions on the base structure where two hydrogen atoms can be replaced by the double bond; radicals are, for example, ═CH2, ═CH-CH3, ═C(CH3)-CH3, ═C(CH3)-C2H5 or ═C(C2H5)-C2H5. Cycloalkylidene denotes a carbocyclic radical bonded via a double bond.
Depending on the nature of the substituents and the manner in which they are attached, the compounds of the general formula (I) may be present as stereoisomers. The formula (I) embraces all possible stereoisomers defined by the specific three-dimensional form thereof, such as enantiomers, diastereomers, Z and E isomers. If, for example, one or more alkenyl groups are present, diastereomers (Z and E isomers) may occur. If, for example, one or more asymmetric carbon atoms are present, enantiomers and diastereomers may occur. Stereoisomers can be obtained from the mixtures obtained in the preparation by customary separation methods. The chromatographic separation can be effected either on the analytical scale to find the enantiomeric excess or the diastereomeric excess, or else on the preparative scale to produce test specimens for biological testing. It is likewise possible to selectively prepare stereoisomers by using stereoselective reactions with use of optically active starting materials and/or auxiliaries. The invention thus also relates to all stereoisomers which are embraced by the general formula (I) but are not shown in their specific stereomeric form, and to mixtures thereof.
Synthesis of substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides:
The inventive 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I), optionally having further substitution, can be prepared by known processes. The synthesis routes used and examined proceed from commercially available or easily preparable oxotetrahydroquinolinylsulfonamides and the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides. Oxotetrahydroquinolinylsulfonamides optionally having further substitution (A) can be prepared proceeding from correspondingly substituted anilines (scheme 1). In this case, an aniline optionally having further substitution can be coupled with an appropriate halopropionyl halide using a suitable base in a suitable polar-aprotic solvent and, in the subsequent step, reacted with a suitable Lewis acid in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to give correspondingly substituted oxotetrahydroquinolines in which, in further reaction steps, first the substituted cycloalkyl radical (with the substituents R1, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, R14, where R1, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13 and R14 are as defined further up) is introduced with the aid of a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride, potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate) in a suitable polar-aprotic solvent (e.g. acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide, also abbreviated to DMF in the paragraphs which follow), the product is nitrated with a suitable nitrating acid (e.g. conc. nitric acid) and then the nitro group is converted to the corresponding amino group with the aid of a suitable reducing agent (e.g. tin(II) chloride dihydrate, iron in acetic acid or hydrogen over palladium on charcoal). In this way, the desired illustrative substituted N-cycloalkyloxotetrahydroquinolinylamines (A) are obtained (cf. US2008/0234237, J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29(12), 2433 and Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 43, 1730, J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 5562). Alternatively, a nitro-substituted N-cycloalkyloxotetrahydroquinoline can be obtained via a tandem reaction, mediated by tributyltin hydride and azobis(isobutyronitrile) (corresponding to the abbreviation AIBN), of an alkyl acrylate optionally having further substitution with an o-haloaniline optionally having further substitution (cf. Tetrahedron 2009, 65, 1982; B. Giese et al. Org. React. 1996, 48). This mode of cyclization can also be conducted by electrocatalytic or photochemical means (cf. J. Org. Chem. 1991, 56, 3246; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 5036; Photochem. & Photobiol. Sci. 2009, 8, 751). A further alternative for preparation of nitro-substituted N-cycloalkyloxotetrahydroquinolines is the Beckmann rearrangement of indanonoximes optionally having further substitution. Scheme 1 shows this reaction sequence for preparation of optionally substituted oxotetrahydroquinolinylamines (A) by way of example but without restriction with a 4-methylcyclohexyl substituent on the oxotetrahydroquinolinyl nitrogen and with R2, R3, R4, R7, R8=hydrogen and X and Y═H and W=oxygen. In an analogous manner, it is also possible to prepare oxotetrahydroquinolinylamines (A) in which the R7 and R8 radicals are not hydrogen. In this case, substituted acryloyl halides can be used as suitable starting materials in the synthesis sequence described below.

Oxotetrahydroquinolinylamines in which the N-cycloalkyl radical can be introduced by simple alkylation only with difficulty, if at all, can be prepared by alternative synthesis routes. By way of example, but without restriction, some of these routes are described hereinafter. For 2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl as the N-cycloalkyl radical, the synthesis proceeds, for example, at first via Pd-mediated coupling of an aryl bromide with 2,2-dimethylcyclopropylamine using suitable Pd catalysts (e.g. Pd2(dba)3) and phosphorus-containing ligands (e.g. BINAP, t-BuXPhos) (cf. Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 2953, WO2012168350, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2012, 51, 222; Tetrahedron 2001, 57, 2953), by copper(II) chloride-mediated coupling or by copper acetate-mediated reaction of 2,2-dimethylcyclopropylamine with triphenylbismuth (cf. Chem. Commun. 2011, 47, 897; J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 623) are prepared. The abbreviation ‘dba’ in this context stands for dibenzylideneacetone, BINAP stands for 2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl, while t-BuXPhos stands for 2-di-tert-butylphosphino-3,4,5,6-tetramethyl-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl. Thereafter, the 2,2-dimethylcyclopropylaniline optionally having further substitution can be coupled with an appropriate halopropionyl halide optionally having further substitution, using a suitable base in a suitable polar-aprotic solvent, and, in the subsequent step, reacted with a suitable Lewis acid (e.g. aluminum trichloride or titanium tetrachloride) in a Friedel-Crafts alkylation to give a corresponding N-[2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl]-substituted oxotetrahydroquinoline, which is converted by nitration with nitric acid and subsequent reduction with a suitable reducing agent (e.g. tin(II) chloride hydrate, iron in acetic acid or hydrogen with palladium on charcoal) to the desired N-[2,2-dimethylcyclopropyl]-substituted oxotetrahydroquinolinylamine (B) optionally having further substitution. Scheme 2 shows this reaction sequence by way of example but without restriction with R2, R3, R4=hydrogen, and R7, R8, X and Y═H and W=oxygen.

For spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl and bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl as N-cycloalkyl radicals in the inventive 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides (with R2, R3, R4═H, W═O), the synthesis proceeds, by way of example but without restriction, first via a reaction of a suitable substituted (2E)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)acrylate with the appropriate cycloalkylamine using a suitable amine base (e.g. triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine) in a suitable polar aprotic solvent (e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide, dioxane) at elevated temperature. In the subsequent step, the corresponding substituted 3-[2-(cycloalkylamino)-5-nitrophenyl]acrylate is converted with the aid of hydrogen and a suitable transition metal catalyst, e.g. (Ph3P)3RhCl, in a suitable polar protic solvent (e.g. methanol, ethanol) to the corresponding substituted 3-[2-(cyclobutylamino)-5-nitrophenyl]propanoate. The substituted 3-[2-(cyclobutylamino)-5-nitrophenyl]propanoate thus obtained is then converted with a suitable base (e.g. sodium hydride) in a suitable polar aprotic solvent (e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran) to the corresponding substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinoline. By reduction of the nitro group of the corresponding substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinoline with a suitable reducing agent (e.g. tin(II) chloride hydrate, iron in acetic acid or hydrogen with palladium on charcoal), it is possible to obtain, for example, the optionally further-substituted 6-amino-1-(spiro[3.3]hept-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (C) or, correspondingly, the optionally further-substituted 6-amino-1-(bicyclo[1.1.1]pent-1-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (D) (scheme 3).

R1, R9, R10, R11, R12, R13 and R14 and the corresponding cycloalkyl skeleton are depicted by way of example but without restriction in scheme 5 below with n=1, by a 3,3-difluorocyclobutyl group.

Chem. 2010, 45, 1760) or by diazotization of an amino-substituted aromatic or heteroaromatic and subsequent chlorosulfonation (cf. WO2005/035486). Coupling of the corresponding substituted sulfonyl chloride precursors with the appropriate N-cycloalkyloxotetrahydroquinolinylamines having further substitution with the aid of a suitable base (e.g. triethylamine, pyridine or sodium hydroxide) in a suitable solvent (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, DMSO or dichloromethane) affords the inventive substituted oxotetrahydroquinolinylsulfonamides (for example sub-class (Iaa)).

b) NMR Peak List Method:
The 1H NMR data of selected examples are noted in the form of 1H-NMR peak lists. For each signal peak, first the δ value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The pairs of δ value-signal intensity numbers for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons. The peak list for one example therefore takes the form of: δ1 (intensity1); δ2 (intensity2); . . . ; δi (intensityi); . . . δn (intensityn). The intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of an NMR spectrum in cm and shows the true ratios of the signal intensities. In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.
For calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra, we use tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra which are measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.
The lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation. In addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds, which likewise form part of the subject-matter of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.
In the reporting of compound signals within the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the standard solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-d6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.
The peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average than the peaks of the target compounds (for example with a purity of >90%).
Such stereoisomers and/or impurities may be typical of the particular preparation process. Their peaks can thus help in identifying reproduction of our preparation process with reference to “by-product fingerprints”. An expert calculating the peaks of the target compounds by known methods (MestreC, ACD simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expected values) can, if required, isolate the peaks of the target compounds, optionally using additional intensity filters. This isolation would be similar to the peak picking in question in conventional 1H NMR interpretation.

The present invention further provides for the use of at least one inventive compound selected from the group consisting of substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I), and of any desired mixtures of these inventive substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I), with further active agrochemical ingredients, for example fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators or safeners, for enhancement of the resistance of plants to abiotic stress factors, preferably drought stress, and also for invigoration of plant growth and/or for increasing plant yield.
The present invention further provides a spray solution for treatment of plants, comprising an amount, effective for enhancement of the resistance of plants to abiotic stress factors, of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of the inventively substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I). The abiotic stress conditions which can be relativized may include, for example, heat, drought, cold and aridity stress (stress caused by aridity and/or lack of water), osmotic stress, waterlogging, elevated soil salinity, elevated exposure to minerals, ozone conditions, strong light conditions, limited availability of nitrogen nutrients, limited availability of phosphorus nutrients.
In one embodiment, it is possible, for example, that the compounds envisaged in accordance with the invention, i.e. the appropriate inventively substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I), are applied by spray application to plants or plant parts to be treated correspondingly. The compounds of the general formula (I) or salts thereof are used as envisaged in accordance with the invention preferably with a dosage between 0.00005 and 3 kg/ha, more preferably between 0.0001 and 2 kg/ha, especially preferably between 0.0005 and 1 kg/ha, specifically preferably between 0.001 and 0.25 kg/ha.
The term “resistance to abiotic stress” is understood in the context of the present invention to mean various kinds of benefits for plants. Such advantageous properties are manifested, for example, in the following improved plant characteristics: improved root growth with regard to surface area and depth, increased stolon or tiller formation, stronger and more productive stolons and tillers, improvement in shoot growth, increased lodging resistance, increased shoot base diameter, increased leaf area, higher yields of nutrients and constituents, for example carbohydrates, fats, oils, proteins, vitamins, minerals, essential oils, dyes, fibers, better fiber quality, earlier flowering, increased number of flowers, reduced content of toxic products such as mycotoxins, reduced content of residues or disadvantageous constituents of any kind, or better digestibility, improved storage stability of the harvested material, improved tolerance to disadvantageous temperatures, improved tolerance to drought and aridity, and also oxygen deficiency as a result of waterlogging, improved tolerance to elevated salt contents in soils and water, enhanced tolerance to ozone stress, improved compatibility with respect to herbicides and other plant treatment compositions, improved water absorption and photosynthesis performance, advantageous plant properties, for example acceleration of ripening, more homogeneous ripening, greater attractiveness to beneficial animals, improved pollination, or other advantages well known to a person skilled in the art.
More particularly, the use according to the invention of one or more compounds of the general formula (I) exhibits the advantages described in spray application to plants and plant parts. In addition, the combined use of inventive substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I) with genetically modified cultivars with a view to increased tolerance to abiotic stress is likewise possible.
The further various benefits for plants mentioned above can be combined in a known manner in component form, and generally applicable terms can be used to describe them.

and the effects may occur individually or else in any combination of two or more effects.
The present invention further provides a spray solution for treatment of plants, comprising an amount, effective for enhancement of the resistance of plants to abiotic stress factors, of at least one compound from the group of the inventively substituted 1-cycloalkyl-2-oxotetrahydroquinolin-6-ylsulfonamides of the general formula (I). The spray solution may comprise other customary constituents, such as solvents, formulation auxiliaries, especially water. Further constituents may include active agrochemical ingredients which are described in more detail below.
The present invention further provides for the use of corresponding spray solutions for increasing the resistance of plants to abiotic stress factors. The remarks which follow apply both to the use according to the invention of one or more compounds of the general formula (I) per se and to the corresponding spray solutions.
In accordance with the invention, it has additionally been found that the inventive application of one or more compounds of the general formula (I) in combination with at least one fertilizer as defined further below to plants or in their environment is possible.
Fertilizers which can be used in accordance with the invention together with the compounds of the general formula (I) elucidated in detail above are generally organic and inorganic nitrogen-containing compounds, for example ureas, urea/formaldehyde condensation products, amino acids, ammonium salts and ammonium nitrates, potassium salts (preferably chlorides, sulfates, nitrates), salts of phosphoric acid and/or salts of phosphorous acid (preferably potassium salts and ammonium salts). In this context, particular mention should be made of the NPK fertilizers, i.e. fertilizers which contain nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, calcium ammonium nitrate, i.e. fertilizers which additionally contain calcium, or ammonium sulfate nitrate (general formula (NH4)2SO4NH4NO3), ammonium phosphate and ammonium sulfate. These fertilizers are generally known to the person skilled in the art; see also, for example, Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition, Vol. A 10, pages 323 to 431, Verlagsgesellschaft, Weinheim, 1987.
The fertilizers may additionally comprise salts of micronutrients (preferably calcium, sulfur, boron, manganese, magnesium, iron, boron, copper, zinc, molybdenum and cobalt) and of phytohormones (for example vitamin B1 and indole-(III)-acetic acid) or mixtures of these. Fertilizers used in accordance with the invention may also contain other salts such as monoammonium phosphate (MAP), diammonium phosphate (DAP), potassium sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium sulfate. Suitable amounts for the secondary nutrients or trace elements are amounts of 0.5% to 5% by weight, based on the overall fertilizer. Further possible ingredients are crop protection agents, for example fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, plant growth regulators or safeners, or mixtures thereof. Further details of these are given further down.
The fertilizers can be used, for example, in the form of powders, granules, prills or compactates. However, the fertilizers can also be used in liquid form, dissolved in an aqueous medium. In this case, dilute aqueous ammonia can also be used as a nitrogen fertilizer. Further possible ingredients for fertilizers are described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th edition, 1987, volume A 10, pages 363 to 401, DE-A 41 28 828, DE-A 19 05 834 and DE-A 196 31 764. The general composition of the fertilizers, which, in the context of the present invention, may take the form of straight and/or compound fertilizers, for example composed of nitrogen, potassium or phosphorus, may vary within a wide range. In general, a content of 1% to 30% by weight of nitrogen (preferably 5% to 20% by weight), of 1% to 20% by weight of potassium (preferably 3% to 15% by weight) and a content of 1% to 20% by weight of phosphorus (preferably 3% to 10% by weight) is advantageous. The microelement content is usually in the ppm range, preferably in the range from 1 to 1000 ppm.
In the context of the present invention, the fertilizer and one or more inventive compounds of the general formula (I) may be administered simultaneously. However, it is also possible first to apply the fertilizer and then one or more inventive compounds of the general formula (I), or first to apply one or more compounds of the general formula (I) and then the fertilizer. In the case of nonsynchronous application of one or more compounds of the general formula (I) and the fertilizer, the application in the context of the present invention is, however, effected in a functional relationship, especially within a period of generally 24 hours, preferably 18 hours, more preferably 12 hours, specifically 6 hours, more specifically 4 hours, even more specifically within 2 hours. In very particular embodiments of the present invention, one or more compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention and the fertilizer are applied within a time frame of less than 1 hour, preferably less than 30 minutes, more preferably less than 15 minutes.
Preference is given to the use according to the invention of compounds of the general formula (I) on plants from the group of the useful plants, ornamentals, turfgrass types, commonly used trees which are used as ornamentals in the public and domestic sectors, and forestry trees. Forestry trees include trees for the production of timber, cellulose, paper and products made from parts of the trees. The term useful plants as used here refers to crop plants which are used as plants for obtaining foods, animal feeds, fuels or for industrial purposes.
The useful plants include, for example, the following types of plants: triticale, durum (hard wheat), turf, vines, cereals, for example wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, corn and millet; beet, for example sugar beet and fodder beet; fruits, for example pome fruit, stone fruit and soft fruit, for example apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries and berries, for example strawberries, raspberries, blackberries; legumes, for example beans, lentils, peas and soybeans; oil crops, for example oilseed rape, mustard, poppies, olives, sunflowers, coconuts, castor oil plants, cocoa beans and peanuts; cucurbits, for example pumpkin/squash, cucumbers and melons; fiber plants, for example cotton, flax, hemp and jute; citrus fruits, for example oranges, lemons, grapefruit and tangerines; vegetables, for example spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbage species, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and bell peppers; Lauraceae, for example avocado, Cinnamomum, camphor, or also plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, eggplant, sugar cane, tea, pepper, grapevines, hops, bananas, latex plants and ornamentals, for example flowers, shrubs, deciduous trees and coniferous trees.

Particularly preferred trees which can be improved by the method of the invention are: horse chestnut, Platanaceae, linden tree and maple tree.
The present invention can also be applied to any desired turfgrasses, including cool-season turfgrasses and warm-season turfgrasses. Examples of cool-season turfgrasses are bluegrasses (Poa spp.), such as Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), rough bluegrass (Poa trivialis L.), Canada bluegrass (Poa compressa L.), annual bluegrass (Poa annus L.), upland bluegrass (Poa glaucantha Gaudin), wood bluegrass (Poa nemoralis L.) and bulbous bluegrass (Poa bulbosa L.); bentgrasses (Agrostis spp.) such as creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.), colonial bentgrass (Agrostis tenuis Sibth.), velvet bentgrass (Agrostis canine L.), South German Mixed Bentgrass (Agrostis spp. including Agrostis tenius Sibth., Agrostis canine L., and Agrostis palustris Huds.), and redtop (Agrostis alba L.); fescues (Festuca spp.), such as red fescue (Festuca rubra L. spp. rubra), creeping fescue (Festuca rubra L.), chewings fescue (Festuca rubra commutata Gaud.), sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L.), hard fescue (Festuca longifolia Thuill.), hair fescue (Festucu capillata Lam.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) and meadow fescue (Festuca elanor L.);
ryegrasses (Lolium spp.), such as annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.);
and wheatgrasses (Agropyron spp.), such as fairway wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn.), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum (Fisch.) Schult.) and western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii Rydb.).
Examples of further cool-season turfgrasses are beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata Fern.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), cattails such as Timothy (Phleum pratense L.), sand cattail (Phleum subulatum L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), weeping alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans (L.) Parl.) and crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus L.).
Examples of warm-season turfgrasses are Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp. L. C. Rich), zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp. Willd.), St. Augustine grass (Stenotaphrum secundatum Walt Kuntze), centipedegrass (Eremochloa ophiuroides Munro Hack.), carpetgrass (Axonopus affinis Chase), Bahia grass (Paspalum notatum Flugge), Kikuyugrass (Pennisetum clandestinum Hochst. ex Chiov.), buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloids (Nutt.) Engelm.), Blue gramma (Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag. ex Griffiths), seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz) and sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx. Torr.)). Cool-season turfgrasses are generally preferred for the inventive use. Particular preference is given to bluegrass, bentgrass and redtop, fescues and ryegrasses. Bentgrass is especially preferred.
Particular preference is given to using the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) to treat plants of the respective commercially available or commonly used plant cultivars. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants which have new properties (“traits”) and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or with the aid of recombinant DNA techniques. Crop plants may accordingly be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which are protectable or non-protectable by plant breeders' rights.
The treatment method according to the invention can thus also be used for the treatment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), e.g. plants or seeds. Genetically modified plants (or transgenic plants) are plants in which a heterologous gene has been stably integrated into the genome. The expression “heterologous gene” essentially means a gene which is provided or assembled outside the plant and when introduced into the nuclear, chloroplastic or hypochondrial genome gives the transformed plant new or improved agronomic or other properties by expressing a protein or polypeptide of interest or by downregulating or silencing (an)other gene(s) which is/are present in the plant (using for example antisense technology, cosuppression technology or RNAi technology [RNA interference]). A heterologous gene that is located in the genome is also called a transgene. A transgene that is defined by its specific presence in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event.
Plants and plant varieties which are preferably treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) include all plants which have genetic material which imparts particularly advantageous, useful traits to these plants (whether obtained by breeding and/or biotechnological means or not).
Plants and plant varieties which can likewise be treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) are those plants which are resistant to one or more abiotic stress factors. Abiotic stress conditions may include, for example, heat, drought, cold and aridity stress, osmotic stress, waterlogging, increased soil salinity, increased exposure to minerals, ozone conditions, strong light conditions, limited availability of nitrogen nutrients, limited availability of phosphorus nutrients or shade avoidance.
Plants and plant cultivars which can likewise be treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) are those plants which are characterized by enhanced yield characteristics. Enhanced yield in said plants can be the result of, for example, improved plant physiology, growth and development, such as water use efficiency, water retention efficiency, improved nitrogen use, enhanced carbon assimilation, improved photosynthesis, increased germination efficiency and accelerated maturation. Yield can also be affected by improved plant architecture (under stress and non-stress conditions), including early flowering, flowering control for hybrid seed production, seedling vigor, plant size, internode number and distance, root growth, seed size, fruit size, pod size, pod or ear number, seed number per pod or ear, seed mass, enhanced seed filling, reduced seed dispersal, reduced pod dehiscence and lodging resistance. Further yield traits include seed composition, such as carbohydrate content, protein content, oil content and oil composition, nutritional value, reduction in antinutritional compounds, improved processibility and better storage stability.
Plants that may also be treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) are hybrid plants that already express the characteristics of heterosis, or hybrid effect, which results in generally higher yield, higher vigor, better health and better resistance towards biotic and abiotic stress factors. Such plants are typically produced by crossing an inbred male-sterile parent line (the female crossbreeding parent) with another inbred male-fertile parent line (the male crossbreeding parent). Hybrid seed is typically harvested from the male-sterile plants and sold to growers. Male-sterile plants can sometimes (for example in corn) be produced by detasseling (i.e. mechanical removal of the male reproductive organs or male flowers); however, it is more typical for male sterility to be the result of genetic determinants in the plant genome. In that case, and especially when seed is the desired product to be harvested from the hybrid plants, it is typically beneficial to ensure that male fertility in hybrid plants, which contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility, is fully restored. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the male crossbreeding parents have appropriate fertility restorer genes which are capable of restoring the male fertility in hybrid plants that contain the genetic determinants responsible for male sterility. Genetic determinants for male sterility may be located in the cytoplasm. Examples of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) were for instance described for Brassica species (WO 92/005251, WO 95/009910, WO 98/27806, WO 05/002324, WO 06/021972 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,229,072). However, genetic determinants for male sterility can also be located in the nuclear genome. Male-sterile plants can also be obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering. A particularly useful means of obtaining male-sterile plants is described in WO 89/10396 in which, for example, a ribonuclease such as a barnase is selectively expressed in the tapetum cells in the stamens. Fertility can then be restored by expression in the tapetum cells of a ribonuclease inhibitor such as barstar (e.g. WO 91/002069).
Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) are herbicide-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to one or more given herbicides. Such plants can be obtained either by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such herbicide tolerance.
Herbicide-tolerant plants are for example glyphosate-tolerant plants, i.e. plants made tolerant to the herbicide glyphosate or salts thereof. Thus, for example, glyphosate-tolerant plants can be obtained by transforming the plant with a gene encoding the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Examples of such EPSPS genes are the AroA gene (mutant CT7) of the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium (Comai et al., Science (1983), 221, 370-371), the CP4 gene of the bacterium Agrobacterium sp. (Barry et al., Curr. Topics Plant Physiol. (1992), 7, 139-145), the genes encoding a petunia EPSPS (Shah et al., Science (1986), 233, 478-481), a tomato EPSPS (Gasser et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1988), 263, 4280-4289) or an Eleusine EPSPS (WO 01/66704). It can also be a mutated EPSPS, as described, for example, in EP-A 0837944, WO 00/066746, WO 00/066747 or WO 02/026995. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate oxidoreductase enzyme as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,760 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,463,175. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by expressing a gene that encodes a glyphosate acetyl transferase enzyme as described, for example, in WO 02/036782, WO 03/092360, WO 05/012515 and WO 07/024782. Glyphosate-tolerant plants can also be obtained by selecting plants containing naturally occurring mutations of the abovementioned genes, as described, for example, in WO 01/024615 or WO 03/013226.
Other herbicide-resistant plants are for example plants that are made tolerant to herbicides inhibiting the enzyme glutamine synthase, such as bialaphos, phosphinothricin or glufosinate. Such plants can be obtained by expressing an enzyme detoxifying the herbicide or a mutant glutamine synthase enzyme that is resistant to inhibition. One example of such an effective detoxifying enzyme is an enzyme encoding a phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (such as the bar or pat protein from Streptomyces species). Plants expressing an exogenous phosphinothricin acetyltransferase are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,561,236; U.S. Pat. No. 5,648,477; U.S. Pat. No. 5,646,024; U.S. Pat. No. 5,273,894; U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,489; U.S. Pat. No. 5,276,268; U.S. Pat. No. 5,739,082; U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,810 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,665.
Further herbicide-tolerant plants are also plants that have been made tolerant to the herbicides inhibiting the enzyme hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate (HPP) is converted to homogentizate. Plants tolerant to HPPD inhibitors can be transformed with a gene encoding a naturally occurring resistant HPPD enzyme, or a gene encoding a mutated HPPD enzyme according to WO 96/038567, WO 99/024585 and WO 99/024586. Tolerance to HPPD inhibitors can also be obtained by transforming plants with genes encoding certain enzymes enabling the formation of homogentisate despite inhibition of the native HPPD enzyme by the HPPD inhibitor. Such plants and genes are described in WO 99/034008 and WO 2002/36787. Tolerance of plants to HPPD inhibitors can also be improved by transforming plants with a gene encoding a prephenate dehydrogenase enzyme in addition to a gene encoding an HPPD-tolerant enzyme, as described in WO 2004/024928.
Other herbicide-resistant plants are plants which have been rendered tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors. Known ALS inhibitors include, for example, sulfonylurea, imidazolinone, triazolopyrimidines, pyrimidinyloxy(thio)benzoates, and/or sulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinone herbicides. Different mutations in the ALS enzyme (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase, AHAS) are known to confer tolerance to different herbicides and groups of herbicides, as described, for example, in Tranel nd Wright, Weed Science (2002), 50, 700-712, and also in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,011, U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,824, U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,870 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659. The production of sulfonylurea-tolerant plants and imidazolinone-tolerant plants has been described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,011; U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659; U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,870; U.S. Pat. No. 5,767,361; U.S. Pat. No. 5,731,180; U.S. Pat. No. 5,304,732; U.S. Pat. No. 4,761,373; U.S. Pat. No. 5,331,107; U.S. Pat. No. 5,928,937; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,824; and also in the international publication WO 96/033270. Further imidazolinone-tolerant plants have also been described, for example, in WO 2004/040012, WO 2004/106529, WO 2005/020673, WO 2005/093093, WO 2006/007373, WO 2006/015376, WO 2006/024351 and WO 2006/060634. Further sulfonylurea- and imidazolinone-tolerant plants have also been described, for example, in WO 2007/024782.
Further plants tolerant to ALS-inhibitors, in particular to imidazolinones, sulfonylureas and/or sulfamoylcarbonyltriazolinones can be obtained by induced mutagenesis, by selection in cell cultures in the presence of the herbicide or by mutation breeding, as described, for example, for soybeans in U.S. Pat. No. 5,084,082, for rice in WO 97/41218, for sugarbeet in U.S. Pat. No. 5,773,702 and WO 99/057965, for lettuce in U.S. Pat. No. 5,198,599 or for sunflower in WO 2001/065922.
Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated with the inventive compounds of the general formula (I) are insect-resistant transgenic plants, i.e. plants made resistant to attack by certain target insects. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such insect resistance.
The term “insect-resistant transgenic plant”, as used herein, includes any plant containing at least one transgene comprising a coding sequence encoding:1) an insecticidal crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or an insecticidal portion thereof, such as the insecticidal crystal proteins compiled by Crickmore et al., Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews (1998), 62, 807-813, updated by Crickmore et al. (2005) in the Bacillus thuringiensis toxin nomenclature (online at: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/), or insecticidal portions thereof, for example proteins of the Cry protein classes Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1F, Cry2Ab, Cry3Ae or Cry3Bb or insecticidal portions thereof; or2) a crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof which is insecticidal in the presence of a second other crystal protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or a portion thereof, such as the binary toxin made up of the Cy34 and Cy35 crystal proteins (Moellenbeck et al., Nat. Biotechnol. (2001), 19, 668-72; Schnepf et al., Applied Environm. Microb. (2006), 71, 1765-1774); or3) a hybrid insecticidal protein comprising parts of two different insecticidal crystal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis, such as a hybrid of the proteins of 1) above or a hybrid of the proteins of 2) above, for example the Cry1A.105 protein produced by corn event MON98034 (WO 2007/027777); or4) a protein of any one of points 1) to 3) above wherein some, particularly 1 to 10, amino acids have been replaced by another amino acid to obtain a higher insecticidal activity to a target insect species, and/or to expand the range of target insect species affected, and/or because of changes induced in the encoding DNA during cloning or transformation, such as the Cry3Bb1 protein in maize events MON863 or MON88017, or the Cry3A protein in maize event MIR 604; or5) an insecticidal secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus, or an insecticidal portion thereof, such as the vegetative insecticidal proteins (VIPs) listed under the following link, for example proteins from the VIP3Aa protein class: http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/Home/Neil_Crickmore/Bt/vip.html, or6) a secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus which is insecticidal in the presence of a second secreted protein from Bacillus thuringiensis or B. cereus, such as the binary toxin made up of the VIP1A and VIP2A proteins (WO 94/21795); or7) a hybrid insecticidal protein comprising parts from different secreted proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis or Bacillus cereus, such as a hybrid of the proteins in 1) or a hybrid of the proteins in 2) above; or8) a protein of any one of points 1) to 3) above wherein some, particularly 1 to 10, amino acids have been replaced by another amino acid to obtain a higher insecticidal activity to a target insect species, and/or to expand the range of target insect species affected, and/or because of changes induced in the encoding DNA during cloning or transformation (while still encoding an insecticidal protein), such as the VIP3Aa protein in cotton event COT 102.
Of course, insect-resistant transgenic plants, as used herein, also include any plant comprising a combination of genes encoding the proteins of any one of the abovementioned classes 1 to 8. In one embodiment, an insect-resistant plant contains more than one transgene encoding a protein of any one of the above classes 1 to 8, to expand the range of the target insect species affected or to delay insect resistance development to the plants, by using different proteins insecticidal to the same target insect species but having a different mode of action, such as binding to different receptor binding sites in the insect.
Plants or plant cultivars (obtained by plant biotechnology methods such as genetic engineering) which may also be treated with the compounds according to the invention of the general formula (I) are tolerant to abiotic stress factors. Such plants can be obtained by genetic transformation, or by selection of plants containing a mutation imparting such stress resistance. Particularly useful stress-tolerant plants include the following:a. plants which contain a transgene capable of reducing the expression and/or the activity of the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) gene in the plant cells or plants, as described in WO 2000/004173 or EP 04077984.5 or EP 06009836.5;b. plants which contain a stress tolerance-enhancing transgene capable of reducing the expression and/or the activity of the PARG-encoding genes of the plants or plant cells, as described, for example, in WO 2004/090140;c. plants which comprise a stress-tolerance-enhancing transgene coding for a plant-functional enzyme of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide salvage biosynthetic pathway, including nicotinamidase, nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenyltransferase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase or nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase as described e.g. in EP 04077624.7 or WO 2006/133827 or PCT/EP07/002433.

Typical auxiliaries include: extenders, solvents and carriers.
Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and nonaromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the unsubstituted and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulfones and sulfoxides (such as dimethyl sulfoxide).
If the extender utilized is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Useful liquid solvents essentially include: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and also their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, and also water.

Preference is given to using nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants. Suitable nonionic dispersants include in particular ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristyrylphenol polyglycol ethers, and the phosphated or sulfated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are especially lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate-formaldehyde condensates.

The invention is to be illustrated by the biological examples which follow, but without restricting it thereto.
Biological Examples
In Vivo Analyses
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crop plants were sown in sandy loam in plastic pots, covered with soil or sand and cultivated in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. The test plants are treated at the early leaf stage (BBCH10-BBCH13). To assure uniform water supply before commencement of stress, the potted plants were supplied with water by dam irrigation prior to substance application.
The inventive compounds were first formulated as wettable powders (WP) or dissolved in a solvent mixture. The further dilution was effected with water supplemented with 0.2% wetting agent (e.g. agrotin). The finished spray liquor was sprayed onto the green parts of the plant at an equivalent water application rate of 600 I/ha. Substance application was followed immediately by stress treatment of the plants.
Drought stress was induced by gradual drying out under the following conditions:
“Day”: 14 hours with illumination at −26-30° C.
“Night”: 10 hours without illumination at −18-20° C.
The duration of the respective stress phases was guided mainly by the condition of the stressed control plants. It was ended (by re-irrigating and transfer to a greenhouse with good growth conditions) as soon as irreversible damage was observed on the stressed control plants.
The end of the stress phase was followed by an about 4-7-day recovery phase, during which the plants were once again kept under good growth conditions in a greenhouse. The duration of the recovery phase was guided mainly by when the trial plants had attained a state which enabled visual scoring of potential effects, and was therefore variable.
Once this juncture had been reached, the appearance of the plants treated with test substances was recorded in comparison to the stressed control plants by the following categories:0 no positive effect+ slight positive effect++ clear positive effect+++ strong positive effect
In order to rule out any influence on the effects observed by any fungicidal or insecticidal action of the test compounds, it was additionally ensured that the tests proceeded without fungal infection or insect infestation.
The values reported in tables A-1 and A-2 below are mean values of the results from at least three repeats.

In Vitro Analyses
Effects of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) on the behavior of plants under abiotic stress and the mechanism of action of ABA are described in the literature (cf. Abrams et al., WO97/23441, Park et al. Science, 2009, 324, 1068; Grill et al. Science, 2009, 324, 1064; Tanokura et al. Biophysics, 2011, 7, 123; Schroeder et al. Plant J. 2010, 61, 290). Therefore, it is possible with the aid of a suitable in vitro test system to derive a correlation between the action of ABA and the stress response of a plant under abiotic stress. In the event of water deficiency (drought stress), plants form the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). This binds, along with a co-regulator (Regulatory Component of ABA-Receptor=RCAR according to Grill et al. Science, 2009, 324, 1064 or PYR/PYL according to Cutler et al. Science, 2009, 324, 1068), to a phosphatase (e.g. ABI1, a type 2C protein phosphatase, also abbreviated to PP2C) and inhibits its activity. As a result, a “downstream” kinase (e.g. SnRK2) is no longer dephosphorylated. This kinase, which is thus active, via phosphorylation of transcription factors (e.g. AREB/ABF, cf. Yoshida et al Plant J. 2010, 61, 672), switches on a genetic protection program to increase drought stress tolerance. The assay described hereinafter utilizes the inhibition of the phosphatase ABI1 via the co-regulator RCAR11/PYR1 aus Arabidopsis thaliana. For the determination of activity, the dephosphorylation of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP) was measured at 460 nm. The in vitro assay was conducted in Greiner 384-well PS microplates F-well, using two controls: a) 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and b) 5 μM abscisic acid (ABA). The assay described here was generally conducted with substance concentrations of the appropriate chemical test substances in a concentration range of 0.1 μM to 100 μM in a solution of DMSO and water. The substance solution thus obtained, if necessary, was stirred with esterase from porcine liver (EC 3.1.1.1) at room temperature for 3 h and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min. A total volume of 45 μl was introduced into each cavity of the microplate, having the following composition:1) 5 μl of substance solution, i.e. a) DMSO 5% or b) abscisic acid solution or c) the corresponding example compound of the general formula (I) dissolved in 5% DMSO.2) 20 μl of enzyme buffer mix, composed of a) 40% by vol. of enzyme buffer (10 ml contain equal proportions by volume of 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 500 mM NaCl, 3.33 mM MnCl2, 40 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), b) 4% by vol. of ABI1 dilution (protein stock solution was diluted so as to give, after addition, a final concentration in the assay of 0.15 μg ABI1/well), c) 4% by vol. of RCAR11 dilution (enzyme stock was diluted so as to give, on addition of the dilution to the enzyme buffer mix, a final concentration in the assay of 0.30 μg enzyme/well), d) 5% by vol. of Tween20 (1%), e) 47% by vol. H2O bi-dist.3) 20 μl of substrate mix, composed of a) 10% by vol. of 500 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, b) 10% by vol. of 500 mM NaCl, c) 10% by vol. of 3.33 mM MnCl2, d) 5% by vol. of 25 mM MUP, 5% by vol. of Tween20 (1%), 60% by vol. of H2O bi-dist.
Enzyme buffer mix and substrate mix were made up 5 minutes prior to the addition and warmed to a temperature of 35° C. On completion of pipetting of all the solutions and on completion of mixing, the plate was incubated at 35° C. for 20 minutes. Finally, a relative fluorescence measurement was made at 35° C. with a BMG Labtech “POLARstar Optima” microplate reader using a 340/10 nm excitation filter and a 460 nm emission filter. The efficacy of the compounds of the general formula (I) is reported in the table which follows using abscisic acid (5 mM) as comparative substance (no. 38) according to the following classification: ++++(inhibition ≧90%), +++(90% >inhibition ≧70%), ++(70% >inhibition ≧50%), +(50% >inhibition ≧30%).
