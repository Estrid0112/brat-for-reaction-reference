Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to novel anti-malarial agents. Specifically, the present invention is related to agents useful for the preparation of a pharmaceutical formulation for preventing or treating malaria and methods of their use and manufacture.
Background of the Invention
Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium that infect and destroy red blood cells, leading to fever, severe anemia, cerebral malaria and, if untreated, death. Plasmodium falciparum is the dominant species in sub-Saharan Africa, and is responsible for almost 1 million deaths each year. The disease burden is heaviest in African children under 5 years of age and in pregnant women. Plasmodium vivax causes 25-40% of the global malaria burden, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, and Central and South America. The other two main species that are known to infect humans are Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae and Plasmodium knowlesi.
Malaria is a disease that is prevalent in many developing countries. Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in countries where the disease is endemic; approximately 247 million people suffer from the disease every year.
Antimalarial drugs are key tools for the control and elimination of malaria. Recent decreases in the global malaria burden are likely due, in part, to the deployment of artemisinin-based combination therapies. However, the increase in artemisinin-resistant parasites in southeast Asia, their potential spread to other malaria-endemic regions and changes in sensitivities to artemisinin partner drugs have raised concerns since it could lead to loss of treatment efficacy and in the worst case lead to an epidemic of drug resistant malaria, unless alternative compounds are identified (Cui et al., 2015, Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 93(Suppl 3), 57-68). Various chemical agents have been developed for the treatment and prevention of malaria over the past 20 years (Wells et al., 2015, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 14, 424-442). Among those, spiro and dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane compounds have been investigated as antimalarials (WO 09/058859 and WO 09/091433) and are still under development, having shown a greatly higher safety margin as compared to artemisinin (Nigussie et al., 2015, Malaria Contr. Elimination, SI: SI-007. doi:10.41721/1000S1-007,- Charman et al., 2011, PNAS, 108 (11), 4400-4405).
Various medications are presently used for the treatment of malaria. However, many of these medications are costly and some exhibit significant toxicity and undesirable side effects in humans. Drugs used for treating malaria include artemisinin and its derivatives such as artemether, artesunate, dihydroartemisinin, and also chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, amodiaquine, atovaquone/proguanil, doxycycline, clindamycin, halofantrine, lumefantrine, pyronaridine, pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, piperaquine and primaquine.
However, current treatments must be taken over 3 days and studies suggest that patient adherence is low which can lead to incomplete cure and contribute to the spread of resistant pathogen strains.
Therefore, the widespread emergence of drug resistance of malaria parasites in endemic countries has compromised many of the current chemotherapies and there is a continued need for new chemotherapeutic approaches. Accordingly, this invention provides novel potent anti-malarial agents and methodology of treating malaria using novel potent anti-malarial agents.

The resulting precipitate was filtered off, and washed with ether (30 ml) and dried in vacuo to afford compound (2) as a mesylate salt as colorless solid (0.22 g, 73%). mp 139-140°C; 1HNMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.56-2.08 (m, 29H), 2.45-2.54 (m, 1H), 2.78 (s, 3H), 2.82-2.94 (m, 2H), 3.44-3.53 (m, 2H), 3.97 (t, J= 6.0Hz, 2H), 6.80 (d, J=8.5Hz, 2H), 7.11 (d, J=8.5Hz, 2H), 8.41 (br, s, 1H), 8.76 (br, s, 1H); 13CNMR (125.7 MHz, CDCl3): δ 16.94, 26.46, 26.86, 28.62, 31.05, 31.63, 34.72, 34.79, 35.11, 36.38, 36.78, 39.29, 42.02, 44.19, 64.59, 108.41, 111.38, 114.23, 127.67, 138.59, 157.00.
Alternatively, cis-Adamantane-2-spiro-3'-8'-[4'-[2'-(4'-piperidinyl)ethoxy]phenyl]-1',2',4'-trioxaspiro[4.5]decane ] was synthesized according to Scheme 3 as described in Scheme 3a:

If the above synthetic methods are not applicable to obtain dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane derivatives according to the invention and/or necessary intermediates, suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual derivative will depend on the specific substituents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Philip J. Kocienski, in "Protecting Groups", Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, 3rd Edition, 2005 and Theodora W. Greene and Peter G. M. Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis ", Wiley Interscience, 5th Edition 2014. Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane derivatives, may be prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solution of a dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane derivative with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.
Example 2: Method used to assess the solubility of compounds of the invention
The solubility of the compounds of the invention was assessed in comparison from another dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane described in WO 09/091433 of the following formula (comparative compound C1):
Compounds were each accurately weighed into individual screw cap polypropylene tubes and media added to give a nominal minimum target compound concentration of 2.2 mg/mL. Samples were vortex mixed and placed in a 37°C incubator where they were continually mixed on an orbital shaker (IKA® VXR basic Vibrax® orbital shaker) at 600 rpm. Incubation times were 1 hour for fasted state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF) and 5 hours for fasted and fed state simulated intestinal fluids (FaSSIF-V2 and FeSSIF-V2 respectively). Sampling was carried out by centrifuging each sample at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes, transferring 300 µL aliquots into fresh Eppendorf tubes and centrifuging these tubes again at 10,000 rpm for 3 minutes. Triplicate aliquots of each final supernatant were diluted 20-fold in 50% aqueous methanol, and then further diluted in 50% aqueous acetonitrile to be within an appropriate concentration range for analysis by LC-MS. LC-MS methods and validation data for the analysis of solubility samples are shown in Table 2 below and the media composition is shown in Table 3.

Example 3: Time-dependent CYP inhibition
Time-dependent CYP inhibition can occur as a result of irreversible interactions of a test compound with a CYP450 enzyme (i.e. mechanism-based inhibition; MBI) or, alternatively, by reversible product inhibition (i.e. whereby the metabolite of the test compound is responsible for inhibition of the CYP). The potential for time-dependent CYP inhibition was assessed using CYP-specific metabolic pathways in human liver microsomes by measuring the formation of metabolites known to be formed by individual CYP isoforms (Table 5) according to the following protocol (probe substrates, metabolites and incubation times):

aSubstrate concentrations used were approximately 5xKm for each metabolic pathway b Recommended that two structurally unrelated substrates be used for CYP3A; Bjornsson et al., 2003, Drug Metab. Dispos., 31: 815-832. Note: Midazolam 1'-hydroxylation and testosterone 6β-hydroxylation are not specific to the CYP3A4 isoform, but can also be mediated by CYP3A5, The potential for inhibition of CYP3A5 cannot be ruled out on the basis of these results (Huang et al., 2004, Drug Metab. Dispos, 32: 1434-1445).
</table>
The assessment of time-dependent inhibition was based on measurement of the "IC50 shift", whereby the IC50 was measured following pre-incubation of test compound (or reference inhibitor) in the absence or presence of NADPH. A 10-fold dilution step was incorporated following the pre-incubation to minimize reversible product inhibition (by potential metabolites of test compound) such that evidence of time-dependent inhibition is more likely to reflect mechanism-based inhibition. The maximum concentration of test compound in the pre-incubation mixture (containing either 1 or 2 mg/mL microsomal protein and 1.0% v/v DMSO) was 200 µM, and the potential for precipitation of test compound was closely monitored at the time of spiking. For each compound, a precipitate was observed immediately after compound was added to the pre-incubation mixture, however this precipitate disappeared following mixing and equilibration at 37°C for approximately 40 min. On this basis, it is assumed that test compounds were fully dissolved at all concentrations in the pre-incubation mixtures. Reference inhibitors (both mechanism-based and reversible inhibitors) were included to validate the assay.
Pre-incubation: Multiple concentrations of test compound or reference inhibitor were incubated in the absence and presence of NADPH at 37°C with human liver microsomes suspended in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 30 min at 10-fold the final assay concentration. The microsomal protein concentration during the pre-incubation period was 1 mg/mL (CYPs 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4) and 2 mg/mL (CYPs 2C9 and 2C19), and the total concentration of organic solvent in the pre-incubation mixture was 1% (v/v).
Assay: Following the 30 min pre-incubation, aliquots of the pre-incubation mixture were diluted 10-fold in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing the respective probe substrate (contributing 0.2% organic solvent to the final mixture) for an individual CYP isoform (Table 6). An NADPH-regenerating buffer system was added to all samples which were then incubated at 37°C for 10 - 40 min. The total concentration of organic solvent in the final incubation mixture was 0.3% (v/v).

Example 4 : Anti-malarial in vitro and in vivo efficacy of compounds according to the invention
The ability of dispiro 1,2,4-trioxolane derivatives according to the invention to show antimalarial efficacy in vitro and in vivo was tested as described in Charman, et al, 2011, PNAS, 108, 4400-4405 against chloroquine-resistant (K1) and chloroquine-sensitive (NF54) strains of P. falciparum in vitro (Vennerstrom et al. 2004, Nature, 430, 900-904). For studies with synchronized parasites, stages were incubated for 24 h with comparative compound (C1), washed, and then incubated with hypoxanthine, as previously described (Hofer et al. 2008, J Antimicrob Chemother, 62, 1061-1064).
Table 7 below shows the in vitro IC50s (ng/ml) against different strains of P. falciparum, namely K1 and NF54. The in vivo activity is shown in P. berghei (Pb) infected mice in terms of the percentage of inhibition of parasitemia following compound administration and the number of survival days.

Example 5: Anti-malarial activity on artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum isolate
Further, compounds of the invention were further tested on artemisinin-resistant P. falciparum isolate from Cambodia and compared to compound C1 and Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) according to the following Ring-stage survival assays (RSA0-3h), essentially as previously described byWitkowski et al., 2013, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 57:914-93), but with a few modifications in the drug washing procedure to ensure that no residual peroxide was present during the 66h post-treatment period. Briefly, 0-3 h post-invasion ring stages were adjusted to 1% parasitemia and 2.5% haematocrit by adding uninfected erythrocytes, transferred in a total volume of 1 mL into 48-well plates and exposed for 6 h to a range of concentrations (700, 350, 175, 88 and 49 nM) of DHA or one of the compounds tested in this study. After 6 h, cultures were transferred to 15 mL conical tubes, centrifuged at 1400 rpm (400g) for 2 min and carefully washed 2 times with 12 mL of culture medium. The complete removal of the compound after washing was verified by incubating the supernatant recovered after the last washing step with fresh cultures of NF54 parasites and ensuring that no growth inhibition was detected. After washing, blood pellets were resuspended in complete compound-free culture medium, transferred into new wells and cultured for 66 h in standard conditions. Table 8 below presents the Ring-stage survival assay (RSA) values as tested in Wells et al., 2015, supra for compounds of the invention and comparative compounds.

It was observed that DHA led survival ranging from 74 to 33% (at 49 and 700 nM, respectively), which is comparable with the observed values from Straimer et al., 2016, Trends in Parasitology, 32, 682-696). C1 tested at 700 nM was about 45 times more potent than DHA.
Compound (2) is completely inhibiting the growth of the artemisinin-resistant isolate at the 700, 350, 175 and 88 nM and Compound (1) is more than 5 fold more potent than C1. Assuming that RSA0-3h can indeed predict the potency of compounds against artemisinin-resistant parasites in man, those data would suggest that compounds of the invention are highly potent against this tested artemisinin-resistant strain.
