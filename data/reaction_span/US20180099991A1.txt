FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to salts of Obeticholic Acid, their amorphous and crystalline polymorphic forms and processes for preparation thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Obeticholic Acid is useful for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as a single therapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.
Obeticholic Acid is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist. It is a semi-synthetic bile acid analogue structurally represented in FIG. 1 as given below:

U.S. Pat. No. 7,138,390 B2 discloses and claims Obeticholic Acid and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or amino acid conjugates thereof; specifically glycine and taurine conjugates.
WO2016044680 discloses salts of Obeticholic Acid and composition thereof. WO2017137931 discloses (S)-α-methyl benzyl amine and diethylamine salt of Obeticholic Acid.
Active pharmaceutical ingredients often do not exhibit the range of physical properties that makes them directly suitable for formulation development. One of the approaches that are used to modify the characteristics of drug substances is to employ a salt form of the substance. The beneficial aspects of using salt forms as active pharmaceutical ingredients are well known, and enable one to modify aqueous solubility, dissolution rate, solution pH, solid form, hygroscopicity, chemical stability, melting point, and even mechanical properties.
Salt formation is a relatively simple and powerful pre-formulation technique that can result in significant improvement of drug's physicochemical properties. Importantly, different salt forms rarely change drug's pharmacological properties.
Moreover introducing counter ions to the drug structure may result in the increased formation of solid forms, hydrates and solvates which ultimately leads to increase in variability of the drug's pharmaceutical properties providing broader scope to a formulation scientist for formulation optimization for example by providing a product with different properties, e.g., better processing or handling characteristics, improved dissolution profile, or improved shelf-life.
For these reasons, there is a need to study salts of Obeticholic Acid and their solid state characteristics.
