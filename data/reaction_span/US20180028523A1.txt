FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of anti-viral agents. In one embodiment, provided herein are alkaloids, their combinations, their methods of preparation and their uses as drugs, for example, for treatment of disease caused by HSV-1 virus.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) is an enveloped DNA virus, with high incidence, long latency, perineural, and incubating in peripheral nervous system. Young children, organ transplant recipients or people with diminished immunity are susceptible to infection of HSV-1 virus. Once infected, HSV-1 virus can cause serious encephalitis, keratitis and even death. Nucleoside antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir, are the most effective medications available for people infected with HSV. These medications can help to reduce the severity and frequency of symptoms, but cannot cure the infection. In view of the increasing cases of drug-resistant pathogens, it is imperative to develop new and effective antiviral drugs. Marine microorganisms are widely recognized as prolific sources of biologically active and structurally unique natural products because of their unique living condition such as high salinity, high pressure, low temperature, oxygen deficiency and darkness. However, there are few reports of marine-derived antiviral entity (Newman, D. J.; Cragg, G. M. J. Nat. Prod. (2012) 75:311-335; Blunt, J. W.; Copp, B. R.; Keyzers, R. A.; Munro, M. H. G.; Prinsep, M. R. Nat. Prod. Rep. (2014) 31:160-258, and previous annual reports). Thus, there is a need of developing new and effective antiviral drugs.

The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo and then subjected to silica gel chromatography to give pure compounds with formula V.
The compounds were characterized by the following spectroscopic data:
colorless crystal; [α]24D =+133.5 (c 0.017, MeOH); IR (KBr) vmax 3288, 2970, 1721, 1618, 1379 and 1082 cm−1; UV (MeOH) λmax (log ε): 211 (0.41), 233.6 (0.26), 280.9 (0.20), 285 (0.19), 322 (0.21) nm; EIMS m/z 440.2 [M]•+.

In Vivo Antiviral Activity Against HSV-1
The antiviral activities against HSV-1 were evaluated by a cytopathic effects (CPE) assay. Hep-2 monolayer cells were cultured with trypsin enzyme-digesting technique and transferred to 96-well plates. The HSV-1 virus was seeded in Hep-2 cells in 96-well plates, with 2% RPMI-1640 medium, and incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2. After more than 90% lesions, the virus-infected cells were repeatedly frozen and thawed 3 times, centrifuged, quantitative packed and stored at −80° C. Each tested compound was dissolved in 10 μl DMSO to make a homogeneous solution and the solution was diluted 10 times by half-and-half dilution with 2% RPMI-1640 medium. The gradient solution was added to the infected cells incubated in 96-well plates, Ribavirin was used as positive control. Normal cells were used as blank control. Infected cells were used as negative control. All samples were incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2. Pathological changes were observed once every hour, for 24 h. After 90% lesions in negative control, 1% neutral red was added after removal of liquid in 96-well plates. The OD value was determined at 540 nm. IC50 values of tested compounds were calculated by Reed-Muench methods.
The results indicated that the quinolinone derivatives showed different inhibitory activities against HSV-1 virus with IC50 values on a scale of 0.07-100 μM. Especially, compounds with formula I exhibited more potent anti-HSV-1 activity than ribavirin (IC50=78 μM), with IC50 values of 0.07 and 0.21 μM. The results show that alkaloids provided herein have potent anti-HSV-1 activities, and would be useful as anti-viral agents, for example, anti-HSV-1.
