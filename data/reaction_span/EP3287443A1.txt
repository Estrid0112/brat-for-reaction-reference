[TECHNICAL FIELD]
The invention relates to a compound useful for the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with the P2X7 receptor and a pharmaceutical composition containing thereof.
[BACKGROUND ART]
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to serve as a source of energy in cells and a substrate of phosphorylation, as well as an extracellular messenger. It is known that ATP is released from a cell by various stimulation such as cellular injury, inflammation, nociceptive stimulus, reduced blood oxygen level, and also known to be released together with another messenger from a primary sensory nerve terminal. (Non-Patent Document 1) ATP thus released mediates various extracellular signal transductions through an ATP receptor.
ATP receptor is categorized into ionotropic P2X family and G protein-coupled P2Y family. For P2X family, seven subtypes have been reported, and a member of this family forms a homo-trimeric structure or a hetero-trimeric structure together with another member of this subtype and functions as a non-specific cation channel.
The P2X7 receptor, a non-selective cation channel, belongs to the P2X family, and forms a homo-trimeric structure. Activation of P2X7 by extracellular ATP allows for the passage of cations across the plasma membrane. Prolonged or repeated ATP stimulation leads to the pore formation of pannexin hemichannel, and induces the cellular activation following the release of small molecule such as ATP. (Non-Patent Document 2) It is reported that the activation of P2X7 is involved in inflammation, immune and pain by the maturation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 beta and interleukin-18. (Non-Patent Document 3) Thus, it is known that the P2X7 receptor is involved in pain, central nervous system disease, immune disease and inflammatory disease. (Non-Patent Document 7-8, and Patent Document 1)
P2X7 is distributed in macrophages, mast cells, microglia, and astrocytes. It is known that disruption of the P2X7 receptor gene abolishes chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. (Non-Patent Document 4) It is reported that the P451L mutation of the mouse P2X7 gene has impaired pore formation and shows less mechanical sensitivity of neuropathic pain model mice. (Non-Patent Document 5) Additionally, an association between lower pain intensity in chronic pain patients and the hypofunctional allele of P2X7 has been reported, suggesting that P2X7 antagonist is useful in the treatment of chronic pain such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and neuropathic pain.
Additionally, it has been reported that P2X7 may be involved in multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and depression(Non-Patent Document 6), suggesting that P2X7 antagonist is useful in the treatment of these central nervous system disease.
The compounds having an analgesic effect are described in Patent Documents 2-5 and 8-11. However, the compounds have different chemical structures from the compounds of the present invention, and there is neither disclosure nor suggestion about an antagonistic activity for the P2X7 receptor.
The compounds having similar chemical structures to the compounds of the present invention and having an analgesic activity are described in Patent Documents 6, 7, and 12-15. However, there is neither disclosure nor suggestion about an antagonistic activity for the P2X7 receptor.
The compounds having an antagonistic activity for the P2X7 receptor are described in Patent Document 16. However, the compounds have different chemi cal structures from the compounds of the present invention.

Biological test examples for the compounds of the present invention are described below.
Test Example 1 Evaluation of a human P2X7 receptor inhibitory activity
Stably expressing cell line (1321N1 cell transfected with the human P2X7 receptor gene (GenBank accession number NM_002562.5 including T606C and G952A SNP)) was used. The cells were seeded in a 384-well microtiter plate at a concentration of 8000 cells/well and cultured in the medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 25mM HEPES, 1% penicillin and streptomycin in DMEM) for one day at 37°C under 5 % carbon dioxide atmosphere. After replacing with 20 µL of the HBSS buffer (20 mM HEPES, 55.6 mM D-glucose, 1x HBSS(-), pH7.4-7.5), 15 µL of 17.3 µM Yo-Pro solution in the HBSS buffer was added. The plate was placed in high-throughput cellular screening system FLIPR TETRA (Molecullar Devices, LLC.) and 15µL of 130µM BzATP solution in the HBSS buffer was added. Measurement of fluorescence intensity by FLIPR TETRA was started. After eight minutes, 15 µL of DMSO solutions containing different concentrations of the compound of the present invention as prepared by dilution with the HBSS buffer were dispensed to each well through the built-in automatic dispenser, and the measurement of fluorescence intensity was continued for 20 minutes. The maximum fluorescence intensity without the compound of the present invention is calculated as 0% inhibition and the maximum fluorescence intensity when the reference compound was added is calculated as 100% inhibition. Changing values of fluorescence intensity by the compound of the present invention were calculated by difference between maximum and minimum fluorescence intensity for 20 minutes. Inhibition ratios (%) were calculated from the following equation:Inhibition ratio: <img> id-imgb1437.tif </img>1−changing values by a compound of the present invention-changing values by reference compoundchanging values without a compound of the present invention-changing values by reference compound×100 % IC50 was calculated using logistic approximation.
The antagonistic activity for the human P2X7 receptor of the compounds of the present invention is shown in the following table.

Test Example 2 Evaluation of the rat P2X7 receptor inhibitory activity
Stably expressing cell line (1321N1 cell transfected with the rat P2X7 receptor gene (GenBank accession number NM_019256.1 including C586T and C652A SNP)) is used. The cells are seeded in a 384-well microtiter plate at a concentration of 10000 cells/well and cultured in the medium (10% fetal bovine serum, 2mM ClutaMax-1, 1% penicillin and streptomycin in DMEM) for one day at 37°C under 5 % carbon dioxide atmosphere. After replacing with 20µL of the HBSS buffer (20mM HEPES, 55.6mM D-glucose, 1x HBSS(+), pH7.4), 15µL of 17.3 µM Yo-Pro solution in the HBSS buffer is added. The plate is placed in high-throughput cellular screening system FLIPR TETRA (Molecullar Devices, LLC.) and 15µL of 1083µM BzATP solution in the HBSS buffer is added. Measurement of fluorescence intensity by FLIPR TETRA is started. Eight minutes after, 15 µL of DMSO solutions containing different concentrations of the compound of the present invention as prepared by dilution with the HBSS buffer are dispensed to each well through the built-in automatic dispenser, and the measurement of fluorescence intensity is continued for 20 minutes. The maximum fluorescence intensity without the compound of the present invention is calculated as 0% inhibition and the maximum fluorescence intensity when the reference compound is added is calculated as 100% inhibition. Changing values of fluorescence intensity by the compound of the present invention are calculated by difference between maximum and minimum fluorescence intensity for 20 minutes. Inhibition ratios (%) are calculated from the following equation:Inhibition ratio: <img> id-imgb1438.tif </img>1−changing values by a compound of the present invention-changing values by reference compoundchanging values without a compound of the present invention-changing values by reference compound×100 %IC50 is calculated using logistic approximation.
Test Example 3-1: Analgesic Effect in a Seltzer model
Preparation of Partial Sciatic Nerve Ligation model in Rats
Rats are anaesthetized using isoflurane/O2 inhalation anaesthesia. After induction of anesthesia, the left thigh is shaved. An incision was made in the skin just below the hip bone. The muscle was bluntly dissected to expose the sciatic nerve. About one half (1/2) of the sciatic nerve thickness is tightly ligated with a nylon thread and the wound is closed. The right thigh was used as a sham-operated control. The right thigh underwent an identical procedure with the left hind limb, however, the sciatic nerve was not manipulated or ligated.
Evaluation (1)
Two weeks after nerve ligation, the effect on mechanical allodynia was assessed using a series of von Frey filaments. For habituation, the rats were placed into a plastic cage on a wire mesh bottom. Von Frey filaments (0.4 to 26 g) were applied to the plantar surface of the rat hind paws from the wire mesh side, and the value of the filament pressure at which the paw was withdrawn was used as a pain threshold. The measurement of mechanical sensitivity of the right and left hind paws was performed to obtain predose mechanical sensitivity.
