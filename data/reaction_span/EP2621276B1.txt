FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates generally to compounds which act as inhibitors of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 10 enzyme, compositions and therapeutic uses thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Schizophrenia is a debilitating disorder affecting the psychic and motor functions of the brain. It is typically diagnosed in individuals in their early to mid-twenties and symptoms include hallucinations and delusions or at the other extreme, anhedonia or social withdrawal. Across the spectrum, the symptoms are indicative of cognitive impairment and functional disabilities. Notwithstanding improvements in antipsychotic treatments, current therapies, including typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine or olanzapine) antipsychotics, have been less than acceptable and result in an extremely high rate of noncompliance or discontinuation of medication. Dissatisfaction with therapy is attributed to lack of efficacy or intolerable and unacceptable side affects. The side effects have been associated with significant metabolic, extrapyramidal, prolactic and cardiac adverse events. See Lieberman et al., N. Engl. J. Med. (2005) 353:1209-1223.
While multiple pathways are believed to be involved with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia leading to psychosis and cognition deficits, much attention has focused on the role of glutamate/NMDA dysfunction associated with cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels and the dopaminergic D2 receptor associated with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). These ubiquitous second messengers are responsible for altering the function of many intracellular proteins. Cyclic AMP is thought to regulate the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which in turns phosphorylates and regulates many types of proteins including ion channels, enzymes and transcription factors. Similarly, cGMP is also responsible for downstream regulation of kinases and ion channels.
One pathway for affecting the levels of cyclic nucleotides, such as cAMP and cGMP, is to alter or regulate the enzymes that degrade these enzymes, known as 3', 5'-cyclic nucleotide specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The PDE superfamily includes twenty one genes that encode for eleven families of PDEs. These families are further subdivided based on catalytic domain homology and substrate specificity and include the 1) cAMP specific, PDE4A-D, 7A and 7B, and 8A and 8B, 2) cGMP specific, PDE 5A, 6A-C, and 9A, and 3) those that are dual substrate, PDE 1A-C, 2A, 3A and 3B, 10A, and 11A. The homology between the families, ranging from 20% to 45% suggests that it may be possible to develop selective inhibitors for each of these subtypes.
The identification of PDE10 was reported by three groups independently and was distinguished from other PDEs on the basis of its amino acid sequence, functional properties, and tissue distribution (Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. (1999) 274:18438-18445; Loughney et al., Gene (1999) 234: 109-117; Soderling et al., PNAS, USA (1999) 96: 7071-7076). The PDE10 subtype at present consists of a sole member, PDE10A, having alternative splice variants at both the N-terminus (three variants) and C-terminus (two variants), but that does not affect the GAF domain in the N-terminus or the catalytic site in C-terminus. The N-terminus splice variants, PDE10A1 and PDE10A2, differ in that the A2 variant has a PKA phosphorylation site that upon activation, i.e. PKA phosphorylation in response to elevated cAMP levels, results in intracellular changes to the localization of the enzyme. PDE10A is unique relative to other PDE families also having the conserved GAF domain in that its ligand is cAMP, while for the other GAF-domain PDEs the ligand is cGMP (Kehler et al., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents (2007) 17(2): 147-158). PDE10A has limited but high expression in the brain and testes. The high expression in the brain and, in particular, the neurons of the striatum, unique to PDE10, suggests that inhibitors thereto may be well suited from treating neurological and psychiatric disorders and conditions.
Inhibition of PDE10 is believed to be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia and a wide variety of conditions or disorders that would benefit from increasing levels of cAMP and/or cGMP within neurons, including a variety neurological, psychotic, anxiety and/or movement disorders. Accordingly, agents that inhibit PDE10 and especially PDE10A would be desirable as therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Substituted pyrimidine compounds useful as PDE10 inhibitors are disclosed in WO 2010/027097 and WO 2010/030027.

"Cycloalkyl" means a mono-, bi- or tri-cyclic structure, optionally combined with linear or branched structures, having the indicated number of carbon atoms, such as cyclopropyl, cyclopentyl, cycloheptyl, adamantyl, cyclododecylmethyl, 2-ethyl-1- bicyclo[4.4.0]decyl, and the like. "Alkoxy" means an alkoxy group of a straight or branched chain having the indicated number of carbon atoms. C1-6alkoxy, for example, includes methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, and the like. The term "heterocyclyl" as used herein includes both unsaturated heterocyclic moieties comprising a mono- or bicyclic aromatic rings with at least one ring containing a heteroatom selected from N, O and S, and each ring containing 5 or 6 atoms (i.e. "heteroaryl") and saturated heterocyclic moieties comprising mono- or bicyclic saturated rings with at least one ring containing a heteroatom selected from N, O and S, and each ring containing 3, 5 or 6 atoms.

The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more stereogenic centers and can thus occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. Any formulas, structures or names of compounds described in this specification that do not specify a particular stereochemistry are meant to encompass any and all existing isomers as described above and mixtures thereof in any proportion. When stereochemistry is specified, the invention is meant to encompass that particular isomer in pure form or as part of a mixture with other isomers in any proportion.
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.
The present invention also includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopic variations of a compound of the Formula I in which one or more atoms is replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen such as 2H and 3H, carbon such as 11C, 13C and 14C, nitrogen such as 13N and 15N, oxygen such as 150, 170 and 18O, phosphorus such as 32P, sulfur such as 35S, fluorine such as 18F, iodine such as 23I and 125I, and chlorine such as 36Cl. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I, for example those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.

Exemplifying the invention are the specific compounds disclosed in the Examples and herein. The subject compounds are useful in a method of treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE10 dysfunction in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention. The subject compounds are useful in a method of inhibiting PDE10 activity in a patient such as a mammal in need of such inhibition comprising the administration of an effective amount of the compound. The subject compounds are also useful for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. In addition to primates, especially humans, a variety of other mammals can be treated according to the method of the present invention.
The present invention is directed to a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for use in medicine. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with PDE10 dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof. The present invention is further directed to a use of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for the manufacture of a medicament for treating a neurological or psychiatric disorder associated with striatal hypofunction or basal ganglia dysfunction in a mammalian patient in need thereof.
"Treating" or "treatment of" a disease state includes: 1) preventing the disease state, i.e. causing the clinical symptoms of the disease state not to develop in a subject that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease state, but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease state; 2) inhibiting the disease state, i.e., arresting the development of the disease state or its clinical symptoms; 3) or relieving the disease state, i.e., causing temporary or permanent regression of the disease state or its clinical symptoms.
The subject treated in the present methods is generally a mammal, in particular, a human being, male or female, in whom therapy is desired. The term "therapeutically effective amount" means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. It is recognized that one skilled in the art may affect the neurological and psychiatric disorders by treating a patient presently afflicted with the disorders or by prophylactically treating a patient afflicted with such disorders with an effective amount of the compound of the present invention. As used herein, the terms "treatment" and "treating" refer to all processes wherein there may be a slowing, interrupting, arresting, controlling, or stopping of the progression of the neurological and psychiatric disorders described herein, but does not necessarily indicate a total elimination of all disorder symptoms, as well as the prophylactic therapy to retard the progression or reduce the risk of the noted conditions, particularly in a patient who is predisposed to such disease or disorder.
Applicants propose that inhibitors of PDE10 and, in particular inhibitors of PDE10A, will provide therapeutic benefit to those individuals suffering from psychiatric and cognitive disorders. The unique and exclusive distribution of PDE10A in the medium spiny projection neurons of the striatum, which form the principle site for cortical and dopaminergic input within basal ganglia, suggests that it may be possible and desirable to identify inhibitors of PDE10 to ameliorate or eliminate unwanted cellular signaling within this site. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, Applicants believe that inhibition of PDE10A in the striatum will result in increased cAMP/cGMP signaling and striatal output, which has the potential to restore behavioral inhibition that is impaired in cognitive disease such as schizophrenia. Regulation and integration of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs will enhance cognitive behavior, while suppressing or reducing unwanted behavior. Thus, in one embodiment, compounds of the invention provide a method for treating or ameliorating diseases or conditions in which striatal hypofunction is a prominent feature or ones in which basal ganglia dysfunction plays a role, such as, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders, addiction and psychosis. Other conditions for which the inhibitors described herein may have a desirable and useful effect include those requiring a reduction in activity and reduced response to psychomotor stimulants or where it would be desirable to reduce conditional avoidance responses, which is often predictive of clinical antipsychotic activity.
As used herein, the term "'selective PDE10 inhibitor" refers to an organic molecule that effectively inhibits an enzyme from the PDE10 family to a greater extent than enzymes from the PDE 1-9 or PDE11 families. In one embodiment, a selective PDE10 inhibitor is an organic molecule having a Ki for inhibition of PDE10 that is less than or about one-tenth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE10 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-tenth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. Preferably, a selective PDE10 inhibitor is an organic molecule, having a Ki for inhibition of PDE10 that is less than or about one-hundredth that for a substance that is an inhibitor for another PDE enzyme. In other words, the organic molecule inhibits PDE10 activity to the same degree at a concentration of about one-hundredth or less than the concentration required for any other PDE enzyme. A "selective PDE10 inhibitor" can be identified, for example, by comparing the ability of an organic molecule to inhibit PDE10 activity to its ability to inhibit PDE enzymes from the other PDE families. For example, an organic molecule may be assayed for its ability to inhibit PDE10 activity, as well as PDE1A, PDE1B, PDE1C, PDE2A, PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE4D, PDE5A, PDE6A, PDE6B, PDE6C, PDE7A, PDE7B, PDE8A, PDE8B, PDE9A, and/or PDE11A.
Phosphodiesterase enzymes including PDE10 have been implicated in a wide range of biological functions. This has suggested a potential role for these enzymes in a variety of disease processes in humans or other species. The compounds of the present invention have utility in treating a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

The activity of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as PDE10 inhibitors may be readily determined without undue experimentation using a fluorescence polarization (FP) methodology that is well known in the art (Huang, W., et al., J. Biomol Screen, 2002, 7: 215). In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in reference assays by exhibiting the ability to inhibit the hydrolysis of the phosphosphate ester bond of a cyclic nucleotide. Any compound exhibiting a Ki (inhibitory constant) below 1 µM would be considered a PDE10 inhibitor as defined herein.
In a typical experiment the PDE10 inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental method. PDE10A2 was amplified from human fetal brain cDNA (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) using a forward primer corresponding to nucleotides 56-77 of human PDE10A2 (Accession No. AF127480, Genbank Identifier 4894716), containing a Kozak consensus sequence, and a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 2406-2413 of human PDE10A2 (Accession No. AF127480, Genbank Identifier 4894716). Amplification with Easy-A polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was 95°C for 2 minutes followed by thirty three cycles of 95°C for 40 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 2 minutes 48 seconds. Final extension was 72°C for 7 minutes. The PCR product was TA cloned into pcDNA3.2-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to standard protocol. AD293 cells with 70-80% confluency were transiently transfected with human PDE10A2/pcDNA3.2-TOPO using Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer specifications (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Cells were harvested 48 hours post-transfection and lysed by sonication (setting 3,10 X 5 sec pulses) in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Lysate was collected by centrifugation at 75,000 xg for 20 minutes. Supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was used for evaluation of PDE10A2 activity. The fluorescence polarization assay for cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases was performed using an IMAP® FP kit supplied by Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA (product # R8139). IMAP® technology has been applied previously to phosphodiesterase assays (Huang, W., et al., J. Biomol Screen, 2002, 7: 215). Assays were performed at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 µL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 8 µL of each of 10 solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition is determined using a known PDE10 inhibitor, which can be any compound that is present at 5,000 times its Ki value in the assay described as follows, such as papaverine (see Siuciak, et al. Neuropharmacology (2006) 51:386-396; Becker, et al. Behav Brain Res (2008) 186(2):155-60; Threlfell, et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther (2009) 328(3):785-795), 2-{4-[pyridin-4-yl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenoxymethyl}quinoline succinic acid or 2-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenoxymethyl]quinoline succinic acid (see Schmidt, et al. J Pharmacol Exp Ther (2008) 325:681-690; Threlfell, et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther (2009) 328(3): 785-795). 0% of inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations).
A Labcyte Echo 555 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) is used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to the 384 well assay plate. A solution of enzyme (1/1600 dilution from aliquots; sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) and a separate solution of FAM-labeled cAMP PDE from Molecular Devices (product # R7506), at a final concentration of 50 nM are made in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NaN3 0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT). The enzyme and the substrate are then added to the assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 µL, and then shaken to mix. The reaction is allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 minutes. A binding solution is then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction is stopped by addition of 60 µL of the binding solution to each well of the assay plates and the plates are sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plate was incubated at room temperature for at least one hour prior to determining the fluorescence polarization (FP). The parallel and perpendicular fluorescence of each well of the plate was measured using a Perkin Elmer EnVision™ plate reader (Waltham, MA). Fluorescence polarization (mP) was calculated from the parallel (S) and perpendicular (P) fluorescence of each sample well and the analogous values for the median control well, containing only substrate (So and Po), using the following equation:<img> id-imgb0019.tif </img>Polarization mP=1000*S/So−P/Po/S/So+P/Po.
Dose-inhibition profiles for each compound were characterized by fitting the mP data to a four-parameter equation given below. The apparent inhibition constant (KI), the maximum inhibition at the low plateau relative to "100% Inhibition Control" (Imax; e.g. 1=> same as this control), the minimum inhibition at the high plateau relative to the "0% Inhibition Control" (Imin, e.g. 0=> same as the no drug control) and the Hill slope (nH) are determined by a non-linear least squares fitting of the mP values as a function of dose of the compound using an in-house software based on the procedures described byMosser et al., JALA, 2003, 8: 54-63, using the following equation:<img> id-imgb0020.tif </img>mP=0%mP−100%mPImax−Imin1+Drug(10−pKI1+SubstrateKMnH+100%mP+0%mP−100%mP1−Imax
The median signal of the "0% inhibition controls" (0%mP) and the median signal of the "100% inhibition controls" (100%mP) are constants determined from the controls located in columns 1-2 and 23-24 of each assay plate. An apparent (Km) for FAM-labeled cAMP of 150 nM was determined in separate experiments through simultaneous variation of substrate and selected drug concentrations.
Selectivity for PDE10, as compared to other PDE families, was assessed using the IMAP® technology. Rhesus PDE2A3 and Human PDE10A2 enzyme was prepared from cytosolic fractions of transiently transfected HEK cells. All other PDE's were GST Tag human enzyme expressed in insect cells and were obtained from BPS Bioscience (San Diego, CA): PDE1A (Cat# 60010), PDE3A (Cat# 60030), PDE4A1A (Cat# 60040), PDE5A1 (Cat# 60050), PDE6C (Cat# 60060), PDE7A (Cat# 60070), PDE8A1 (Cat# 60080), PDE9A2 (Cat# 60090), PDE11A4 (Cat# 60110).
Assays for PDE 1 through 11 were performed in parallel at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates with an incubation volume of 20.2 µL. Solutions of test compounds were prepared in DMSO and serially diluted with DMSO to yield 30 µL of each of ten solutions differing by 3-fold in concentration, at 32 serial dilutions per plate. 100% inhibition was determined by adding buffer in place of the enzyme and 0% inhibition is determined by using DMSO (1% final concentrations). A Labcyte POD 810 (Labcyte, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to dispense 200 nL from each well of the titration plate to make eleven copies of the assay plate for each titration, one copy for each PDE enzyme. A solution of each enzyme (dilution from aliquots, sufficient to produce 20% substrate conversion) and a separate solution of FAM-labeled cAMP or FAM-labeled cGMP from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, CA, product # R7506 or cGMP#R7508), at a final concentration of 50 nM were made in the assay buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% NaN3 0.01% Tween-20, and 1 mM DTT). Note that the substrate for PDE2 is 50 nM FAM cAMP containing 1000 nM of cGMP. The enzyme and the substrate were then added to the assay plates in two consecutive additions of 10 µL and then shaken to mix. The reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 60 minutes. A binding solution was then made from the kit components, comprised of 80% Solution A, 20% Solution B and binding reagent at a volume of 1/600 the total binding solution. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by addition of 60 µL of the binding solution to each well of the assay plate. The plates were sealed and shaken for 10 seconds. The plates were incubated at room temperature for one hour, then the parallel and perpendicular fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Genios Pro plate reader (Tecan, Switzerland). The apparent inhibition constants for the compounds against all 11 PDE's was determined from the parallel and perpendicular fluorescent readings as described for PDE10 FP assay using the following apparent KM values for each enzyme and substrate combination: PDE1A (FAM cGMP) 70 nM, rhesus PD2A3 (FAM cAMP) 10,000 nM, PDE3A (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE4A1A (FAM cAMP) 1500 nM, PDE5A1 (FAM cGMP) 400 nM, PDE6C (FAM cGMP) 700 nM, PDE7A (FAM cAMP) 150 nM, PDE8A1 (FAM cAMP) 50 nM, PDE9A2 (FAM cGMP) 60 nM, PDE10A2 (FAM cAMP) 150nM, PDE11A4 (FAM cAMP) 1000 nM. The intrinsic PDE10 inhibitory activity of a compound which may be used in accordance with the present invention may be determined by these assays.
All of the final compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the human PDE10 enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally with an Ki of less than about 1 µM. In particular, all of the final compounds of the following examples had activity in inhibiting the human PDE10 enzyme in the aforementioned assays, generally with an Ki of less than about 0.1 µM. Additional data is provided in the following Examples. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as inhibitors of the PDE10 enzyme. In general, one of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that a substance is considered to effectively inhibit PDE10 activity if it has a Ki of less than or about 1 µM, preferably less than or about 0.1 µM. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as inhibitors of other phosphodiesterase enzymes.

The following examples are provided so that the invention might be more fully understood.<img> id-imgb0021.tif </img>
According to Scheme A, thiourea can be condensed with dimethylmalonates to produce dihydroxypyrimidines A1 (Koroniak, H., et al., Org. Prep. Proc. Int. 1993, 25, 563-568;Ji, L., et al., J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 1778-1786). Reaction with iodomethane followed by reflux in phosphoryl bromide yields the dichloropyrimidines F3, which react with primary and secondary amines to give compounds F4 of the invention. Oxidation with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid produces sulfones F5, which can be further derivatized with amines or alkoxides provides subject compounds F6.<img> id-imgb0022.tif </img>
According to Scheme B, ethylene glycol is added to sulfones A5 under strong basic conditions, providing alcohols B1. The alcohols B1 can then undergo substitution with aryl halides under the same conditions to produce compounds B2 of the invention.<img> id-imgb0023.tif </img>
According to Scheme D (wherein R2s is -C1-6alkyl), alkoxides can be added directly to the final products from Scheme A or B in an SNAr fashion to provide alkoxy-substituted derivatives of the formula C2.
