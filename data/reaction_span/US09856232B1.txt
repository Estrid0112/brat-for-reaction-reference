BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present subject matter relates to dihydropyrimidinone derivatives, and particularly to 4-(substituted phenyl)-5-[4-(piperidin-1-yl) benzoyl]-3, 4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one derivatives.
2. Description of the Related Art
Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) is a gastrointestinal disease prevalent in a large population of the world. Complex gastric mucosal damage associated with PUD occurs from an imbalance between the gastro protective factors e.g., (prostaglandin, mucin, bicarbonate, blood supply, nitric oxide, etc.) and the aggressive factors (pepsin, gastric acid, etc.) present in the gastric mucosa. Risk factors of getting PUD include Helicobacter pylori infection, frequent use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and stress-induced mucosal damage.
Many anti-ulcer drugs mainly focus on decreasing the gastric acid secretion and/or increasing the mucosal defense system. Examples of anti-secretory drugs include Ranitidine (and other histamine H2 receptor antagonists), Omeprazole (and other irreversible proton pump inhibitors), and antacids. These drugs treat PUD by reducing or neutralizing the gastric acid, but have serious side effects when used for long times, such as hypergastrinemia, osteoporosis, development a carcinoids, and increased risk of bacterial infection.
Sucralfate may also be used for the treatment of gastric ulceration. However, sucralfate does not exhibit positive results for ulceration caused by non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Ulcers associated with NSAIDs may be prevented by Misoprostol (analogue of prostaglandin E1), which has a limited application due to abnormal side effects. Therefore, a need for potent anti-ulcer agents with improved safety profiles exists.
Pyrimidines have played an important role in medicinal chemistry and are important in the field of medicinal chemistry because of their potential biological activities, such as anti-tumor, anti-virus, and anti-bacterial activities. Some pyrimidines have been used as potential anti-hypertensive agents. 4-Aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines, like Nifedipine, was first introduced into clinical medicine in 1975 as an anti-hypertensive.
Moreover, dihydropyridines are the most potent calcium channel modulators available for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Anti-ulcer activities have been reported for several calcium channel blockers, including Nifedipine.
Compounds containing dihydropyrimidinone and piperidine may have significant potential for the treatment of ulcers, according to a literature study. Dihydropyrimidines, also known as Biginelli compounds, are associated with a broad spectrum of biological activities, and some derivatives of dihydropyrimidine have been reported to possess potent anti-ulcer and anti-secretory activity.
Thus, providing a dihydropyrimidinone derivative as an anti-ulcer agent to solve the aforementioned problems is desired.

The dihydropyrimidinone derivatives can be administered to a patient in need thereof. For example, the dihydropyrimidinone derivatives can be used to treat a patient suffering from a gastrointestinal disease. The gastrointestinal disease can include gastric ulcer, gastroesophagal reflux, Zollinger-Elisson syndrome, and/or other diseases associated with hyper secretion of gastric acid. Therefore, compounds according to Formula 1 may be used as anti-ulcer agents. The present subject matter is also directed to pharmaceutical formulations of the compounds according to Formula 1 in dosage units.
The dihydropyrimidinone derivatives or pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to a subject by any suitable route. For example, the compositions can be administered orally (including bucally and sublingually), nasally, rectally, intracisternally, intra vaginally, intraperitoneally, topically, transdermally (as by powders, ointments, or drops), and/or parenterally. As used herein, “parenteral” administration refers to modes of administration other than through the gastrointestinal tract, which include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, intramammary, intraocular, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary, intrathecal, subcutaneous and intraarticular injection and infusion. Surgical implantation may also be contemplated, including, for example, embedding a composition of the disclosure in the body such as, for example, in a tissue, in the abdominal cavity, under the splenic capsule, brain, or in the cornea.
Accordingly, the route of administration can include intranasal administration, oral administration, inhalation administration, subcutaneous administration, transdermal administration, intradermal administration, intra-arterial administration with or without occlusion, intracranial administration, intraventricular administration, intravenous administration, buccal administration, intraperitoneal administration, intraocular administration, intramuscular administration, implantation administration, topical administration, intratumor administration, and/or central venous administration.
An embodiment of the present subject matter is directed to a pharmaceutical composition including one or more of the dihydropyrimidinone derivatives. To prepare the pharmaceutical composition, one or more of the dihydropyrimidinone derivatives or a salt thereof, as the active ingredient, is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Carriers are inert pharmaceutical excipients, including, but not limited to, binders, suspending agents, lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners, preservatives, dyes, and coatings. In preparing compositions in oral dosage form, any of the pharmaceutical carriers known in the art may be employed. For example, for liquid oral preparations, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like. Further, for solid oral preparations, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents, and the like.
For parenteral use, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents, and the like may be employed. Accordingly, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can include alcohol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a physiological saline, a lipid based formulation, a liposomal formulation, a nanoparticle formulation, a micellar formulation, a water soluble formulation, a biodegradable polymer, an aqueous preparation, a hydrophobic preparation, a lipid based vehicle, or a polymer formulation.
The dihydropyrimidinone derivatives of the present disclosure also can be administered in the form of liposomes. Liposomes generally are derived from phospholipids or other lipid substances and are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid crystals dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any nontoxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present compositions in liposome form can include, in addition to a compound of the present disclosure, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, and the like. The preferred lipids are the phospholipids and the phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic.
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection can include pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or non-aqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions just prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water ethanol, polyols (such as, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such, as olive oil), and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
The present compositions can include adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by the inclusion of various anti-bacterial and anti-fungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It also may be desirable to include isotonic agents such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption, such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin. In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This result can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous materials with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.
The present compositions can be in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, ointments, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampules, auto-injector devices or suppositories, for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. The active compound can be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, if required, any needed preservatives, buffers, or propellants. The composition can be presented in a form suitable for daily, weekly, or monthly administration. The pharmaceutical compositions herein will contain, per dosage unit, e.g., tablet, capsule, powder, injection, teaspoonful, suppository and the like, an amount of the active ingredient necessary to deliver an effective dose. A therapeutically effective amount of the dihydropyrimidinone derivative or an amount effective to treat a gastrointestinal disease, such as a disease associated with hyper secretion of gastric acid, may be determined initially from the Examples described herein and adjusted for specific desired dihydropyrimidinone derivatives using routine methods.
The following examples illustrate the present teachings.
EXAMPLE 1
Synthesis of the Dihydropyrimidinone Derivatives
As shown in FIG. 1, enaminone (III), (2E)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-[4-(piperidin-1-yl) phenyl] prop-2-en-1-one was synthesized by refluxing 1-[4-(piperidin-1-yl) phenyl] ethan-1-one (I) with dimethylforamide dimethylacetal (DMF-DMA) (II) under solvent free conditions for 10 hours.
The structure of the isolated product was confirmed by elemental analysis and spectral data. 1H NMR spectrum displayed two singles at δ 2.89, 3.17 ppm due to the N, N-dimethyl protons and two doublets at δ 5.77 and 7.65 ppm (J=12 Hz) due to the ethylenic protons, in addition to the multiplet at the region δ 6.89-7.78 ppm (4H, aromatic). The value of coupling constant (J=12.5 Hz) for the ethylenic protons indicated, that the enaminone (III) exist in the E-configuration. A single crystal X-ray structure also confirmed the three dimensional structure of enaminone (III). Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) number 1532826 contains crystallographic data for the structure (III).
To prepare the final dihydropyrimidinone derivatives, a solution of enaminone (III) (0.01 mol), substituted benzaldehyde (0.01 mol), urea (0.01 mol), and Glacial acetic acid (10 mL) was heated under reflux for 3 hours. The precipitates (Compounds N-1 to N-18) thus formed were collected by filtration, washed with water and recrystallized from Glacial acetic acid and ethanol mixture. In the 1H-NMR spectra, the signals of the individual protons of the compounds were verified on the basis of multiplicity, chemical shifts and the coupling constant. All of the compounds showed the D2O exchangeable broad singlet at δ 6.97-7.31 ppm and δ 9.07-9.67 ppm corresponding to the two NH protons. Analytical and spectral data for the compounds were in good agreement with the expected structures of the compounds. The single crystal X-ray structure confirms the three dimensional structure of dihydropyrimidinone derivative N-13 (FIG. 2). Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC) number 1532825 contains crystallographic data for the structure N-13.
The spectral data for compounds N-1 to N-18 are provided below.

EXAMPLE 2
Evaluation of Anti-Ulcer Activity and Gastric Secretion in Rats
Albino Wistar rats of either sex, approximately the same age, weighing 150 to 200 g and fed on a diet of standard chow were used in this study. They were randomly divided into experimental groups of six rats each. Compounds (N-1 to N-18) 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg were given orally in the anti-ulcer studies and intraperitoneally for gastric secretion evaluation. The rats were sacrificed, and the stomachs removed and opened along the greater curvature, After washing with saline, the gastric lesions were quantified by a person unaware of the treatments. The animal study protocol was approved by the Research and Ethics Committee of the Experimental Animal Care Society, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Gastric lesions induced by ethanol: Albino rats of either sex weighing between (150-200 g) are divided into groups. The animals were fasted for 24 hours with free access to water. Animals were given test drugs or standard drug. One hour later 1 mL/200 gm of 80% ethanol is administered orally to each animal. The animals were anaesthetized 1 hour latter with anesthetic ether and stomach was incised along the greater curvature and ulceration was scored. The number of ulcers and the length of each ulcer were measured. Ulcer index was calculated using severity scores. The mucosal damage was examined by means of a magnifying glass. For each stomach the mucosal damage was assessed according to the following scoring system: 0.5 redness; 1.0 spot ulcers; 1.5 hemorrhagic streaks; 2.0 ulcers<3, but≦5; 3.0 ulcers>5. Table 1 provides the effect of compounds on gastric lesions induced by 80% ethanol (mean±SE).

Gastric lesions induced by necrotizing agents (cytoprotection): Each rat was administered 1 ml of a necrotizing agent (80% ethanol, 0.2 mol/L NaOH or 25% NaCl). Compounds (N-3, N-8, N-11, and N-15) were given 30 minutes before the administration of necrotizing agents. One hour after the administration of ethanol and the alkalis, the rats were sacrificed and examined for stomach lesions.
The scoring of stomach lesions was as follows: patchy lesions of the stomach induced by ethanol were scored according to the method described using the following scale: 0=normal mucosa; 1=hyperemic mucosa or up to 3 small patches; 2=from 4 to 10 small patches; 3=more than 10 small or up to 3 medium-sized patches; 4=from 4 to 6 medium-sized patches; 5=more than 6 medium-sized or up to 3 large patches; 6=from 4 to 6 large patches; 7=from 7 to 10 large patches; 8=more than 10 large patches or extensive necrotic zones. “small” was defined as up to 2 mm across (max. diameter), “medium-sized” between 2 and 4 mm across and “large” more than 4 mm across. Table 2 provides the effect of compounds on gastric lesions induced by necrotizing agents (mean±SE).

Hypothermic restraint stress-induced ulcers: Animals were fasted for 36 hours but had access to water ad libitum. Thirty minutes after the oral administration of compounds (N-3, N-8, N-11, and N-15) 12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg, the rats were immobilized in restraint cages and placed inside a ventilated refrigerator maintained at 3±1° C. for 3 hours. The animals were then sacrificed and the stomachs were excised. They were examined for ulceration and the severity of intraluminal bleeding according to the following arbitrary scale. 0=no blood detectable; 1=thin blood follows the rugae; 2=thick blood follows the rugae; 3=thick blood follows the rugae with blood clots in certain areas; and 4=extensive covering of the whole gastric mucosal surface with thick blood.

Pylorus-ligated rats: Rats were fasted for 36 hours with access to water ad libitum before pylorus ligation under ether anesthesia was carried out. Care was taken not to cause bleeding or to occlude blood vessels. Compounds (N-3, N-8, N-11, and N-15) were administered intraperitoneally immediately after pylorus ligation. The rats were sacrificed at 6 hours after pylorus ligation. The stomachs were removed, the contents were collected, volumes measured, centrifuged and analyzed for tritratable acidity against 0.01 mol/h, NaOH at pH 7.0.

Determination of gastric wall mucus (GWM): Gastric wall mucus was determined according to the modified procedure. The glandular segment of the stomach was separated from the rumen of the stomach, weighed, and transferred immediately to 10 mL of 0.1% w/v Alcian blue solution (in 0.16 mmol/L sucrose solution buffered with 0.05 mL sodium acetate at pH 5. Tissue was stained for 2 hours in Alcian blue, and excess dye was removed by two successive rinses with 10 mL of 0.25 mmol/L sucrose, firstly after 15 minutes and then after 45 minutes. Dye complexed with the gastric wall mucus was extracted with 10 ml of 0.5 mmol/L magnesium chloride which was intermittently shaken for 1 minute at 30 minute intervals for 2 hours. Four milliliters of blue extract were then vigorously shaken with an equal volume of diethyl ether. The resulting emulsion was centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 10 minutes and the absorbance of the aqueous layer was recorded at 580 nm. The quantity of Alcian blue extracted per gram of wet glandular tissue was then calculated. Table 6 provides the effect of compounds on the change in gastric wall mucus in stomach tissue induced by 80% ethanol (mean±SE).

Estimation of non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH): Gastric mucosal non-protein sulfhydryls were measured according to the method. The glandular part of the stomach was homogenized in ice-cold 0.02 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Aliquots of 5 mL of the homogenates were mixed in 15 mL test tubes with 4 mL of distilled water and 1 mL of 50% trichloroacetic acid (TCA). The tubes were shaken intermittently for 10 minutes and centrifuged at 3000 r/min. Two milliliters of supernatant were mixed with 4 mL of 0.4 mol/L Tris buffer at pH 8.9. Then 0.1 ML of 5, 5'-dithio-bis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was added and the sample was shaken. The absorbance was measured within 5 minutes of DTNB addition at 412 nm against a reagent blank.
Determination of malondialdehyde (MDA): The animals were sacrificed 1 hour after ethanol administration. The stomachs were removed and each was homogenized in 0.15 mol/L KCl (at 4° C.) in a Potter-Elvehjem type C homogenizer to give a 10% w/v homogenate. Aliquots of homogenate 1 mL in volume were incubated at 37° C. for 3 hours in a metabolic shaker. Then 1 mL of 10% aqueous TCA was added and mixed. The mixture was then centrifuged at 800 g for 10 minutes. One milliliter of the supernatant was removed and mixed with 1 mL of 0.67% w/v thiobarbituric acid in water and placed in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. The mixture was cooled and diluted with 1 mL distilled water. The absorbance of the solution was then read at 535 nm. The content of malondialdehyde (nmol/g wet tissue) (index of the magnitude of lipid peroxidation) was then calculated, by reference to a standard curve of malondialdehyde solution. Table 7 provides the effect of compounds on the levels of MDA, NP-SH, and total protein in stomach tissue induced by 80% ethanol (mean±SE).

LD50 determination: For each mouse, the observation was made for 24 hours and symptoms of toxicity and rate of mortality in each group were noted. At the end of the study period, expired animals were counted for the calculation of LD50. The following arithmetic method from Karber (Arch. Exptl. Pathol. Pharmakol, 1963, 162, 480-483) was used for the determination of LD50:<in-line-formulae>LD50=LD100−Σ×(a×b)/n </in-line-formulae>
wherein n=total number of animals in a group; a=the difference between two successive doses of administered extract/substance; b=the average number of dead animals in two successive doses; and LD100=lethal dose causing the 100% death of all test animals.
Table 8 provides the LD50 values of the compounds determined by the Karber method.

Histopathological evaluation: Gastric tissue samples were fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 24 hours. Sections of gastric tissue were histopathologically examined to study the ulcerogenic and/or anti-ulcerogenic activity of compounds (N-3, N-8, N-11, and N-15). The tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed using a VIP tissue processor. The processed tissues were embedded in paraffin blocks and sections about 5 mm thick were cut using an American optical rotary microtome. These sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin using routine procedures. The slides were examined microscopically for pathomorphological changes such as congestion, hemorrhage, edema, and erosions using an arbitrary scale for severity assessment of these changes (FIGS. 3-14).
Furthermore, FIG. 15A shows a gastric section of rats treated with 80% Ethanol only, showing mucosal ulceration. FIG. 15B shows a gastric section of rats treated with Ranitidine (50 mg/kg) showing normal mucosa. FIG. 15C shows a gastric section of rats treated with compound N-3 (50 mg/kg) showing intact mucosa with mild ulceration. FIG. 15D shows a gastric section of rats treated with compound N-8 (50 mg/kg) showing intact normal mucosa, FIG. 15E shows a gastric section of rats treated with compound N-11 (50 mg/kg) showing intact normal mucosa. FIG. 15F shows a gastric section of rats treated with compound N-15 (50 mg/kg) showing intact normal mucosa.
Statistical analysis: Values in tables and figures are given as mean±SE. Data were analyzed by using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Student's t-test.
Biological evaluation of the compounds of Formula 1 of the present subject matter revealed that the compounds possess remarkable anti-ulcer activity. The results clearly point to the discovery of a new group of anti-ulcer agents. Compounds of Formula 1 can be used as anti-ulcer agents to produce effects comparable to those of the anti-ulcer drug Ranitidine.
