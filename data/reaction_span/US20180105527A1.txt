2. Description of the Related Art
As indicated in the fluid mosaic model, the eukaryotic cell membrane is not even and floated or anchored to form a specialized compartment, which is called a lipid raft. This lipid raft is rich in cholesterol so as to prevent lysis of the membrane by a detergent. Some proteins prefer lipid attachment than being hydrophobic transmembrane anchored. Phosphatidyl inositol is an intracellular protein found in the lipid raft on cell membrane, which is attached on cell membrane by fatty acid or prenyl link. The lipid raft is very dynamic and can coagulate proteins to make them very active.
The protein phosphorylation mediated by kinase is an important way for a cell to regulate physiological activities. The activity of many enzymes is regulated by the phosphorylation mediated by kinase. Another important role of the kinase-mediated phosphorylation is to provide a protein binding site. That is, other proteins are gathered together in the binding site of the phosphorylated area and bound together there without changing the inherent characteristics of the phosphorylated protein. Many kinases involved in signal transduction are found in the lipid raft on the intracellular surface of cell membrane. When a membrane-associated protein is phosphorylated by the activation of a cell surface receptor, this phosphorylated area becomes the protein binding site for those proteins floating alone. These target proteins are not active when they are floating alone without being attached in cytoplasm but become phosphorylated and active when they are gathered together in the binding site to increase their concentration there.
Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase; PI3K) is the lipid kinase that is responsible for the phosphorylation of a lipid molecule instead of a protein, which plays an important role in cell survival, signal transduction, and control of membrane trafficking. Once there is a problem in any of these regulations, a disease such as cancer, inflammatory disease, and autoimmune disease is developed.
Signal transduction in the cell through 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositide is associated with various cellular processes such as malignant transformation, growth factor signaling, inflammation, and immunity. PI3 kinase playing a role in producing the phosphorylated signal transduction product was first identified in the course of investigation of the interaction between the viral oncoprotein that induced the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivative at 3-OH of inositol ring and the growth factor receptor tyrosin kinase.
Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3), the primary product of the PI3 kinase activation, is up-regulated by treating cells with various stimuli which are exemplified by growth factor and inflammatory stimuli, hormone, neurotransmitter, and antigen receptor mediated signal transduction, etc. So, the activation of PI3 kinase, even though it is not dominant, presents one of the cell surface receptor activation associated signal transductions in mammals. Therefore, the PI3 kinase activation is believed to be involved in a variety of cell responses including cell growth, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis.
PI3 kinase is the enzyme to phosphorylate the 3rd position (3-OH) of the inositol ring moiety of phosphatidylinositol by using ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Precisely, PI3 kinase phosphorylates 3'-OH of inositol ring of phosphatidylinositide to change PIP2 into PIP3. This PIP3 is then functioning as a binding site for the protein kinases containing pleckstrin homology. These protein kinases regulate important cell functions one another. Among the PIP3 binding protein kinases, the most important one is the serine/threonine kinase that is AKT or PKB (protein kinase B), which regulates cell growth, cell survival, and cell division via its downstream mTOR, GSK3β, Foxo 3a, p70S6K, and NF-κB.
It was confirmed by the primary purification and molecular cloning of PI3 kinase that PI3 kinase is a heterodimer composed of p85 and p110 subunits. Considering sequence homology and substrate specificity, it belongs to class I and class I is also classified into class IA and class IB.
Class IA includes PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kδ, and class IA is the downstream of RTK (receptor tyrosine kinase). Class IB represents PI3Kγ, and is the downstream of G protein coupled receptor. Each class is composed of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit and the control subunit.
More particularly, three catalytic subunits, p110α, p110β, and p110δ, contain ATP binding domain and interact with the control subunit p85 equally and also are activated by receptor tyrosine kinase. In the meantime, PI3Kγ interacts with another control subunit p101 and is activated by the heterotrimer G-protein. Control domain includes the domain for anchoring on the cell surface receptor.
When ATP binding is inhibited, PIP2 phosphorylation is suppressed and therefore PIP3 is not generated. As a result, an important regulatory protein such as AKT cannot be functioning for anchoring on the cell membrane. So, it is an important target of drug development to inhibit such a catalytic subunit and its ATP binding site.
As explained hereinafter, the expression pattern of each PI3K differs from each other in human cells and tissues. PI3Kα and PI3Kβ display a wide tissue distribution, while PI3Kγ is mainly found in white blood cells and also found in skeleton muscle, liver, pancreas, and heart. PI3Kδ is only expressed in spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood lymphocytes. The expression pattern above indicates that PI3Kα and PI3Kβ are deeply involved in cancer, while PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ are rather associated with adaptive immune system such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and hematological malignance.
Particularly, p110α mutation has been found in some solid tumors. For example, α amplification has been confirmed to be associated with 50% of ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer, and hyperactivation has been confirmed to be associated with at least 50% of colon cancer and at least 25% of breast cancer. p110β is confirmed to be involved in thrombopoiesis and the p110γ associated compounds have been developed as an immunosuppressant for autoimmune disease. The autoimmune disease herein includes rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.
P110δ plays a key role in B and T cell activation. Further, δ is also partly involved in neutrophil migration and sudden increase of respiration. It is also confirmed that δ can partially interrupt the antigen-IgE mediated mast cell degranulation. P110δ draws our attention as an important mediator for not only autoimmune disease and allergic reaction but also multiple major inflammatory reactions including abnormal inflammatory diseases. Target evaluation data for p110δ have been filed up from the studies using the genetic tools and pharmacological agonists, which support the confirmation above. The inhibition of δ results in the significant improvement of inflammation and the related disease, confirmed in the ovalbumin induced airway inflammation murine asthma model. Rituximab and Belimumab, the PI3Kδ monoclonal antibodies, are effective in RA and SLE.
It is also disclosed recently that PI3K is involved in the inflammation in the lung and the ear. The mechanism involved in there is not completely explained yet the over-expressed p110δ-AKT-mTOR pathway increases aerobic glycolysis but decreases the function and survival of lymphocytes, leading to the decrease of immune response.
Chronic inflammation is not unique in autoimmune disease, but PI3Kδ and phosphorylated-AKT are characteristically up-regulated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The over-expression of PI3Kδ and phosphorylated-AKT is not only associated with immune disease but also associated with inflammation.
Therefore, it is suggested that the inhibition of PI3Kδ can be effective not only in treating autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) but also in treating chronic non-autoimmune disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
It has been recently reported that a novel compound with a novel structure to inhibit selectively PI3 kinase has been developed. Precisely, patent reference 1 presents a compound useful for cancer treatment which displays the PI3K enzyme inhibiting activity. Patent reference 2 describes that 4-morpholino-substituted bicyclic heteroaryl compound has the PI3K activity inhibiting effect.
Thus, the present inventors tried to develop a novel compound with a novel structure that is effective in inhibiting PI3 kinase selectively. In the course of the study, the inventors confirmed that the heteroaryl derivative with a specific structure had the activity of inhibiting PI3K α, β, δ, and γ selectively and particularly was more excellent in inhibiting PI3K δ and γ. Therefore, the inventors confirmed that the heteroaryl derivative can be effectively used as a pharmaceutical composition for the prevention and treatment of PI3 kinase related diseases, leading to the completion of this invention.

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PI3K α)
The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase alpha (PI3K α) by those compounds prepared in Examples 1˜98 was investigated by the following experiment. The inhibition activity of each compound was measured in the following conditions: ATP=10 uM, and sample concentration=100 nM.
Step 1: Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-453) cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Hyclon, SH30243.01) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclon, USA) were distributed in a 12-well plate at the density of 1,000,000 cells/well. The cells were stabilized in a 37° C. CO2 for 24 hours and then treated with each compound for 1 and half hours. The cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor, 10 μg/mL; R&D, 2150-C5) to increase the intracellular activity of PI3K alpha. 5 minutes later, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline, Gibco, 14190-250). PBS was then eliminated completely by using a pipette. Western blotting was performed as described in step 2 to evaluate the intracellular PI3K alpha activity.
Step 2: Western Blotting
The stimulated cells were transferred in a 1.5 mL tube, followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 minute. 100 μL of RIPA buffer (radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, pH 8.0; ELPIS, Korea) was added thereto, which was stored in a 4° C. refrigerator for 12 hours. Centrifugation was performed at 4° C. at 14,000 rpm for 20 minutes. The supernatant was transferred into a new 1.5 mL tube. Protein was quantified by BCA (bicinchoninic acid) method and samples were prepared. The composition of the sample was as follows: sample buffer (ELPIS, EBA-1052) 5×, protein 10 μg, and 1× sample buffer to make the total volume 20 μL. The sample was heated at 100° C. for 5 minutes. The evaporated water vapor was condensed in a refrigerator. The liquid stained on the wall was fallen down by centrifugation for a few seconds. The sample proceeded to 10% SDS (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate) acrylamide gel for separation. The separated protein was transferred onto PVDF (poly-vinyl difluoride) membrane, followed by reaction with pAkt (phospho protein kinase B) antibody (Ser473 or Thr308; Cell signaling, 9271s or 13038s) for 12 hours at 4° C.. The membrane was washed with TBST (Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween 20, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) three times for 5 minutes each, to which the secondary antibody (rabbit antibody, Santacruz,sc-2004) was added, followed by reaction at room temperature for 2 hours. The membrane was washed with TBST three times for 10 minutes each, to which ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence, Thermo, NCI34095KR) was sprayed. Bands were investigated by using LAS-3000.
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase beta (PI3K β)
The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase beta (PI3K β) by those compounds prepared in Examples 1˜98 was investigated by the following experiment. The inhibition activity of each compound was measured in the following conditions: ATP=10 uM, and sample concentration=100 nM.
Human prostate cancer cells (PC3 cells) cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Hyclon, SH30243.01) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclon, USA) were distributed in a 12-well plate at the density of 1,000,000 cells/well. The cells were stabilized in a 37° C. CO2 for 24 hours and then treated with each compound for 1 and half hours. The cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of LPA (lysophosphatidic acid, 10 μg/mL; R&D, 2150-05) to increase the intracellular activity of PI3K beta. 5 minutes later, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline, Gibco, 14190-250). PBS was then eliminated completely by using a pipette. Western blotting was performed according to the same manner as described in step 2 of Experimental Example 1 to evaluate the intracellular PI3K beta activity.
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase gamma (PI3K γ)
The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase gamma (PI3K γ) by those compounds prepared in Examples 1˜98 was investigated by the following experiment. The inhibition activity of each compound was measured in the following conditions: ATP=10 uM, and sample concentration=100 nM.
Macrophages (RAW264.7) cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, Hyclon, SH30243.01) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclon, USA) were distributed in a 12-well plate at the density of 1,000,000 cells/well. The cells were stabilized in a 37° C. CO2 for 24 hours and then treated with each compound for 1 and half hours. The cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of C5a (complement component 5a, 10 μg/mL; R&D, 2150-C5) to increase the intracellular activity of PI3K gamma. 5 minutes later, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline, Gibco, 14190-250). PBS was then eliminated completely by using a pipette. Western blotting was performed according to the same manner as described in step 2 of Experimental Example 1 to evaluate the intracellular PI3K gamma activity.
EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 4
Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta (PI3K δ)
The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase delta (PI3K δ) by those compounds prepared in Examples 1˜98 was investigated by the following experiment. The inhibition activity of each compound was measured in the following conditions: ATP=10 uM, and sample concentration=100 nM.
Raji cells cultured in RPMI1640 (Hyclone, SH30027.02) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclon, USA) were distributed in a 12-well plate at the density of 1,000,000 cells/well. The cells were stabilized in a 37° C. CO2 for 24 hours and then treated with each compound for 1 and half hours. The cells were treated with 0.25 μg/mL of IgM (immunoglobulin M, Southern Biotech, USA) to increase the intracellular activity of PI3K delta. 30 minutes later, the medium was discarded and the cells were washed with cold PBS (phosphate buffered saline, Gibco, 14190-250). PBS was then eliminated completely by using a pipette. Western blotting was performed according to the same manner as described in step 2 of Experimental Example 1 to evaluate the intracellular PI3K delta activity.
The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha, beta, gamma, and delta (PI3K α, β, γ, and δ) by those compounds prepared in Examples 1˜98 was investigated and the results obtained in Experimental Examples 1˜4 are shown in Table 3.
