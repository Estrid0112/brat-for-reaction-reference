TECHNICAL FIELD
The description herein is directed to trinucleotide cap analogs for improved in vitro mRNA synthesis and translation of m7G(5')p3-RNA.
BACKGROUND
Eukaryotic mRNAs have a cap structure at their 5'-termini. The cap consists of 7-methyl guanosine (m7G) and a triphosphate bridge, ppp (p3), linking the 5'OH of m7G to the 5'OH of the 5'-terminal nucleotide, N, denoted m7G(5')pppN (m7G(5')p3N). In eukaryotic cells, the cap structure participates in assembly of the translation initiation complex by binding eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF-4E).
Although m7G(5')p3 can be used to initiate transcription with T7 or SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase in vitro, it has the disadvantage of having to compete with guanine nucleotide (G) as the initiating nucleophile for transcriptional elongation. As a result of this competition, less than half of mRNA produced in vitro have a cap structure at their 5' termini.
Dinucleotide m7G(5')p3(5')G, in which a guanine nucleotide (G) is linked via its 5'OH to the triphosphate bridge, has been used as an initiator of transcription. This dinucleotide has the disadvantage that the 3'-OH of either the m7G or G moiety serves as the initiating nucleophile for transcriptional elongation that results in synthesis of two isomeric RNAs of the form m7G(5')p3G(pN)n and G(5')p37G(pN)n, with one third to one half of the caps oriented in the reverse direction, depending upon the ionic conditions of the transcription reaction. Further improvement of the orientation of the cap during in vitro transcription is possible using cap analogues that replace the 3'-OH group with hydrogen or -OCH3 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,074,596; Kore, 2006, Nucleotides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids, 25: 307-14, and Kore, 2006, Nucleotides, Nucleotides, and Nucleic Acids, 25: 337-40).
Dinucleotide GG cap analogs m7G(5')p3G and 3'-OMe-m7G(5')p3G (ARCA) are sold commercially by TriLink BioTechnology, MilliporeSigma, ThermoFisher Scientific, and New England BioLabs Inc. 3'-OMe-m7G(5')p3G (ARCA) is incorporated during transcription without reversal to G(5')p3 m7G.
Trinucleotide cap analogs were disclosed by Ishikawa, 2009, Nucleic Acid Symp. Ser., 53:129-30. These arem7G(5')p3ApG, corresponding to the terminal trinucleotide of plant RNA;m7G(5')p3AmpG (Am is adenine with a 2'OMe-ribose), corresponding to the terminal trinucleotide of animal RNA;m7G(5')p3 m6AmpG (m6A is N6-methyladenine), corresponding to the terminal trinucleotide of mammal RNA; andm7G(5')p3 m6ApG, an unnatural trinucleotide.Ishikawa discloses that translational efficiency in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system is greatest with mRNA transcribed with an animal-type, followed by a mammalian-type, the unnatural, and the plant-type cap structures, respectively, and that G(5')p3Ampm7G-RNA, a result of transcribing in a reverse orientation, was not obtained. Id.
In view of the disclosure of these publications, there remains a need to identify modified cap structures that improve the efficiency of in vitro transcription.

The use of “or” herein means “and/or” unless stated otherwise or where the use of “and/or” is clearly inappropriate. The use of “a” herein means “one or more” unless stated otherwise or where the use of “one or more” is clearly inappropriate. The use of “comprise,” “comprises,” “comprising,” “include,” “includes,” and “including” are interchangeable and not intended to be limiting.
As used herein, “Me” means “CH3”, and “OCH3” or “OMe” denotes an oxygen atom bound to a methyl group, “CHO” denotes a carbon atom, C, bonded to a hydrogen atom, H, and double-bonded to an oxygen atom, O, (O═CH-) and “Et” denotes “C2H5”.
“Cap” herein means a non-extendible trinucleotide that facilitates translation or localization, and/or prevents degradation of an RNA transcript when incorporated at the 5' end of an RNA transcript. It consists in nature of the modified base 7-methylguanosine joined in the opposite orientation, 5' to 5' rather than 5' to 3', to the rest of the RNA molecule via three phosphate groups i.e., PI-guanosine-5'-yl P3-7-methylguanosine-5'-yl triphosphate (m7G5'ppp5'G).
“Hydrate” is a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H2O.
A “cap analog” means a structural derivative of an RNA cap that may differ by as little as a single element. Cap analog is used for the synthesis of 5' capped RNA molecules in in vitro transcription reactions.

mRNA Synthesis
The trinucleotide cap analogs disclosed herein are used for improving the synthesis of 5' capped RNA molecules in in vitro transcription reactions. Substitution of cap analog for a portion of the GTP in a transcription reaction results in the incorporation of the cap structure into a corresponding fraction of the transcripts.
Transcription of RNA usually starts with a nucleotide triphosphate (usually a purine, A or G). When transcription occurs in vitro, it typically includes a phage RNA polymerase such as T7, T3 or SP6, a DNA template containing a phage polymerase promoter, nucleotides (ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP) and a buffer containing magnesium salt. The synthesis of capped RNA includes the incorporation of a cap (e.g., m7GpppG) or a cap analog (such as those described herein) in the transcription reaction. Excess cap to GTP (e.g., 4:1) increases the opportunity that each transcript will have a 5' cap. The mMES SAGE mMACHINE® SP6 Transcription Kit and SP7 Ultra Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) recommends this ratio and will typically yield 80% capped RNA to 20% uncapped RNA, although total yields of total RNA are lower as GTP concentration becomes rate limiting as GTP is necessary for the elongation of the transcript.
Capped mRNAs are generally translated more efficiently in reticulocyte lysine and wheat germ in vitro translation systems. It is important that in vitro transcripts be capped for microinjection experiments because uncapped mRNAs are rapidly degraded. Cap analogs are also used as a highly specific inhibitor of the initiation step of protein synthesis.
The 5' cap structure enhances the translation of mRNA by helping to bind the eukaryotic ribosome and assuring recognition of the proper AUG initiator codon. This function may vary with the translation system and with the specific mRNA being synthesized. The consensus sequence 5'-GCCACCAUGG-3', also known as the “Kozak” sequence, is considered to be the strongest ribosomal binding signal in eukaryotic mRNA. For efficient translation initiation, the key elements are the 5' G residue at the +1 position and the A residue at the 3' position of the mRNA.
The mRNA can be transfected into a cell to be translated intracellularly. Methods of transfection are known to those of skill in the art and include microinjection, electroporation, chemical treatments and the like. Cells for use in in vivo translation include any patient cell for which it is desired to express a protein of interest. Cells include hematopoietic cells (e.g., T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, etc.), bone marrow cells, tissue culture cells, germ cells, and the like.
Compositions comprising modified capped RNA as described herein can be used for in vitro transcription, in vitro translation, and in vivo translation, for example. Current biotechnology efforts for in vitro, in situ, and in vivo protein production will also benefit from these methods and compositions. Further, compositions provided herein are useful for therapeutic purposes. For example, the present technology may be useful for generating vaccines against infectious diseases or cancers. Alkyne-derivatized capped RNA can be used to produce non-infectious particles of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus containing an RNA encoding immunogen. These non-replicating viral particles can be injected into humans where they can enter host cells. Once in the host cell, the viral particles dissociate and the mRNA encoding the immunogen is translated into protein. These proteins can induce an immune response. These types of vaccines are expected to be useful for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), feline immunodeficiency virus, human papilloma virus type 16, tumors, lassa virus, Ebola virus, Marburg virus, anthrax toxin from Bacillus anthraces, and botulinum toxin. These vaccine strategies can require large quantities of capped RNA. The present methods facilitate such synthesis and subsequent purification of capped RNA so as to make these vaccines commercially feasible. As well, strategies to increase the percentage of full length capped RNA in a transcription reaction leading to a more homogenous product will be preferred in the vaccine industry as highly pure components are usually required for human use. In addition, researchers prefer to use products that are as pure as possible to minimize the number of variables in an experiment. As well, the purer the product, the more potent it is.
Such oligomers or oligonucleotides may be prepared by solid state synthesis or by other means known to those skilled in the art. For example, 2'-O-alkyl guanosine phosphoramidites and derivatives thereof may be incorporated into oligonucleotides using standard phosphoramidite chemistry. Incorporation of 2'-O-alkyl guanosine nucleotides may confer desirable characteristics to an oligonucleotide such as enhanced resistance to nuclease.
“Oligonucleotide” or “oligomer” as used herein means a polynucleotide formed from naturally occurring bases and furanosyl groups joined by native phosphodiester bonds. Oligonucleotides of the description herein will, of course, comprise at least one 2'-O-alkyl guanosine or derivative thereof. Thus, this term effectively refers to naturally occurring species or synthetic species formed from naturally occurring subunits or their close homologs. The term “oligonucleotide” or “oligomer” may also refer to moieties which have portions similar to naturally occurring oligonucleotides but which have non-naturally occurring portions. Thus, oligonucleotides may have altered sugars, altered base moieties, or altered inter-sugar linkages. Exemplary among these are the phosphorothioate and other sulfur-containing species which are known for use in the art. In accordance with some preferred embodiments, at least some of the phosphodiester bonds of the oligonucleotide have been substituted with a structure which functions to enhance the stability of the oligonucleotide or the ability of the oligonucleotide to penetrate into the region of cells where the messenger RNA is located. It is preferred that such substitutions comprise phosphorothioate bonds, phosphotriesters, methyl phosphonate bonds, short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl structures or short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic structures. Other preferred substitutions are CH2-NH-O-CH2, CH2-N(CH3)-O-CH2, CH2-O-N(CH3)-CH2, CH2-N(CH3)-N(CH3)-CH2 and O-N(CH3)-CH2-CH2 structures where phosphodiester intersugar linkage is replaced by the substitutions. Also preferred are morpholino structures. In accordance with other preferred embodiments, the phosphodiester bonds are substituted with other structures which are, at once, substantially non-ionic and non-chiral, or with structures which are chiral and enantiomerically specific. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select other linkages for use in practice of the invention.
Oligonucleotides may also include species which include at least some modified base forms. Thus, purines and pyrimidines other than those normally found in nature may be so employed. Suitable bases include modifications on the furanosyl portion of the nucleotide subunits, in addition to 2'-O-alkyl modifications of the description herein, may also be effected, as long as the essential tenets of this invention are adhered to. Examples of such modifications are 2'-halogen-substituted nucleotides. Some specific examples of modifications at the 2' position of sugar moieties which are useful in the description herein are OH, SH, SCH3, F, OCN, O(CH2)nNH2, Cl, Br, CN, CF3, OCF3, S-, OC1-OC12, O-alkenyl, O-alkynal, or N-alkyl; S- or N-alkenyl; SOCH3, SO2CH3; ONO2; NO2; N3; NH2; heterocycloalkyl; heterocycloalkaryl; aminoalkylamino; polyalkylamino; substituted silyl; an RNA cleaving group; a conjugate; a reporter group; an intercalator; a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide; or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide and other substituents having similar properties. Sugar mimetics such as cyclobutyls may also be used in place of the pentofuranosyl group. Oligonucleotides may also comprise other modifications consistent with the spirit of this invention. Such oligonucleotides are best described as being functionally interchangeable with yet structurally distinct from natural oligonucleotides. All such oligonucleotides are comprehended by this invention so long as they effectively function as subunits in the oligonucleotide.
Preferably oligonucleotides of the description herein are from about 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length. In still more preferred embodiments of the description herein oligonucleotides are from about 12 to about 20 nucleotides in length.
Intercalators are molecules which insert themselves between neighboring bases of an oligonucleotide, e.g., acridine.
Reporter molecules are molecules which may aid in the identification of a molecule, either visually or otherwise. For example, biotin and various fluorophores are effective reporter groups.
Conjugates, or bifunctional linkers effectively join two groups. Some conjugates are commercially available such as biotin or 3' maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxy-succinimide.
Pharmacodymanic property improvement means, in this context, improved oligonucleotide uptake, enhanced oligonucleotide resistance to degradation, and/or strengthened sequence-specific hybridization with RNA. Such groups do not initiate chemical reactions. Groups that enhance the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide preferably include alkyl chains, polyamines, ethylene glycols, polyamides, alkyl chains, aminoalkyl chains and amphipathic moieties. Pharmacokinetic property improvement means improved oligonucleotide uptake, distribution, metabolism or excretion.
Antisense therapy involves the use of oligonucleotides which are specifically hybridizable to target RNA or DNA. Oligonucleotides of the description herein are preferably specifically hydridizable with a target region. “Specifically hybridizable” means capable of forming a stable duplex with a target DNA or RNA. Upon binding to, or forming a stable duplex with, the target RNA or DNA, the antisense oligonucleotide can selectively inhibit the genetic expression of these nucleic acids or can induce some other events such as destruction of a targeted RNA or DNA or activation of gene expression. Destruction of targeted RNA can be effected by RNase H activation or by linking strand cleavers to the oligonucleotide.
In some embodiments of the description herein the oligonucleotide portions of trinucleotide compounds of the description herein are at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 100% complementary to a target sequence. In preferred embodiments of the description herein the oligonucleotide portions of trinucleotide compounds of the description herein are at least 60%, 70%, or 80% complementary to a target sequence. 100% complementarity of the oligonucleotide portions of trinucleotide compounds of the description herein to a target sequence is most preferred. In preferred embodiments of the description herein, the oligonucleotide portions may be specifically hybridizable with DNA or RNA from Candida, papilloma virus, Epstein Barr virus, rhinovirus, hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus and cytomegalovirus.
2-O-alkyl guanosine containing oligonucleotides of the description herein may be used to modulate the production of protein by contacting a selected sequence of RNA or DNA coding for a selected protein with an 2'-O-alkyl guanosine containing oligonucleotide of the description herein having a sequence of nucleotide bases specifically hybridizable with said selected sequence of RNA or DNA coding for said protein.
The oligonucleotides of the description herein can be used in diagnostics, therapeutics and as research reagents. For therapeutic use, an animal having a disease characterized by the undesired production of a protein is contacted with an oligonucleotide of the description herein having a sequence of nucleotide bases specifically hybridizable with a selected sequence of RNA or DNA coding for said protein.
Pharmaceutical Use
Another use of compositions described herein involves isolating dendritic cells (DCs) from a patient and then transfecting the dendritic cells with derivatized capped RNA as described herein encoding immunogen. The dendritic cells translate the derivatized capped RNA into at least one protein that induces an immune response against this protein.
Morse, 2002, Int J Gastrointest Cancer, 32:1-6, discloses that immunotherapy with dendritic cells loaded with CEA capped RNA is safe and feasible for pancreatic cancer patients. Heiser, 2002, J Clin Invest, 109:409-17, discloses that introducing at least one single capped RNA species into immature dendritic cells induced a specific T-cell response. The cap analogs provided herein can be used for providing mRNAs for antigen delivery to DCs for the purpose of immunotherapy against cancer and infectious diseases.
Other uses include reprogramming differentiated cells to pluripotency and/or to re-program pluripotent cells using capped RNA described herein to specifically differentiate cell types by continuous transfection of specific derivatized-capped mRNAs over a time-period necessary for changing the cell differentiation.
Trinucleotide compounds of the disclosure may be in the form of compositions suitable for administration to a subject. In general, such compositions are “pharmaceutical compositions” comprising at least one trinucleotide compound and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically acceptable diluents, carriers or excipients. In certain embodiments, trinucleotide compounds of the disclosure are present in a therapeutically acceptable amount. The pharmaceutical compositions may be used in the methods of the description herein; thus, for example, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered ex vivo or in vivo to a subject in order to practice the therapeutic and prophylactic methods and uses described herein.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the description herein can be formulated to be compatible with the intended method or route of administration; exemplary routes of administration are set forth herein. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical compositions may be used in combination with other therapeutically active agents or trinucleotide compounds as described herein in order to treat or prevent the diseases, disorders and conditions as contemplated by the description herein.
The description herein contemplates the administration of trinucleotide compounds of the disclosure, and compositions thereof, in any appropriate manner. Suitable routes of administration include oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous (e.g., injection or implant), intraperitoneal, intracisternal, intraarticular, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intraparenchymal) and intracerebroventricular), nasal, vaginal, sublingual, intraocular, rectal, topical (e.g., transdermal), sublingual and inhalation.
Trinucleotide compounds of the disclosure may be administered to a subject in an amount that is dependent upon, for example, the goal of administration (e.g., the degree of resolution desired); the age, weight, sex, and health and physical condition of the subject to which the formulation is being administered; the route of administration; and the nature of the disease, disorder, condition or symptom thereof. The dosing regimen may also take into consideration the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse effects associated with the agent(s) being administered. Effective dosage amounts and dosage regimens can readily be determined from, for example, safety and dose-escalation trials, in vivo studies (e.g., animal models), and other methods known to the skilled artisan.
In general, dosing parameters dictate that the dosage amount be less than an amount that could be irreversibly toxic to the subject (the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)) and not less than an amount required to produce a measurable effect on the subject. Such amounts are determined by, for example, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters associated with ADME, taking into consideration the route of administration and other factors.
An effective dose (ED) is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in some fraction of the subjects taking it. The “median effective dose” or ED50 of an agent is the dose or amount of an agent that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50% of the population to which it is administered. Although the ED50 is commonly used as a measure of reasonable expectance of an agent's effect, it is not necessarily the dose that a clinician might deem appropriate taking into consideration all relevant factors. Thus, in some situations the effective amount is more than the calculated ED50, in other situations the effective amount is less than the calculated ED50, and in still other situations the effective amount is the same as the calculated ED50.
The amount and frequency of administration of the trinucleotide compounds of this disclosure and/or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, condition and size of the patient as well as severity of the symptoms being treated.

The DMTr guanosine compound 38 was dissolved in a stirred mixture of dioxane and water. To this mixture was added NaIO4 dissolved in water, stirred for one hour, and further dioxane is added. The suspension was filtered and the filter cake was washed with dioxane. The filtrates were combined and sodium borohydride was added and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes (FIG. 17, step ii). The mixture was neutralized by addition of pyridine:acetic acid buffer. After evaporation, DCM is added and the mixture was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The organic phase was separated and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, to yield 5'O-DMT-2',3'-secoguanine.
2'-O-benzoyl-5'-O-DMT-2',3'-secoguanine compound 39 was prepared from 5'O-DMT-2',3'-secoguanine by the method of Landkjaer 2009. The nucleotide was co-evaporated with anhydrous toluene and dried for 12 hours in vacuo. The residue was dissolved at room temperature in anhydrous mixture of DCM with pyridine and cooled to −78° C. Benzoyl chloride was added over 15 minutes with stirring for 1 hour at −78° C. The mixture was warmed to room temperature, and ethanol was added and the mixture was washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and the separated aqueous phase was back-extracted with DCE. The organic phases were combined and evaporated to dryness to yield the 2'-O-benzoylated secoguanine compound 39 (FIG. 13, step ii).
The 3'-OH group of the the 2'-O-benzoylated secoguanine was protected by TBDMSCl according to the method of Perlikova 2014, ChemBioChem, 15:146-156 (hereby incorporated by reference) (FIG. 13, step iii) to yield compound 40.
The 2'-O-benzoyl group compound 40 was removed by the method of N1shino, 1985, Tetrahedron, 41:5503-06 (hereby incorporated by reference) using a suspension of sodium methoxide in THF for 1 hour at room temperature (FIG. 13, step iv). The reaction was quenched by neutralization to yield the free 2'-OH group of compound 41.
The 2'-OH group of compound 41 was methylated by reaction with NaH and methyl iodide in THF at 0° C. (step v) to yield compound 42. The silyl group was removed from the 3'-OH group with nBu4NF by the method of Perlikova 2014 and the 3'-OH group was butyrlated (step v) to produce the secoguanine compound 43 after removal of the DMTr protecting group with acid (CF3CO2H, step vi).

First, 3'-p-2'-OMeA compound 18 was mixed with an equivalent of 2'OMe guanosine compound 43 in anhydrous acetonitrile and the mixture was dried by evaporation. A solution of 2,4,6,-triisopropylbenzenesulfonyl chloride and N-methylimidazole in acetonitrile was added and the mixture was reacted for 4 hours to produce compound 44 (FIG. 14, step i).
The protective groups of compound 44 were removed (step ii, using reactions described in Example 4, FIG. 5, step i), to produce a 2'-OMeA-2'-OMeG dinucleotide compound 45. The 5'-hydroxy group of the adenosine group was phosphorylated according to the method of Lewdorowicz 2007 (FIG. 14, step iii). Phosphorus trichloride oxide in trimethyl phosphate was cooled to 4° C. and the 5'-O-guanine-adenine dinucleotide-3'-O compound 45 was added and stirred at 4° C. for 3 hours. Tetraethylammoniuum bromide (TEAB) was added to neutralize the mixture to produce 2'-OMe-m6Ap-seco-2'-OMeG 5'-monophosphate, compound 46.

For Vaccinia mRNA, in vitro transcription was performed using the standard protocol without ARCA or ARC CAP1. All of components were mixed, and T7 RNA polymerase (E2040 from NEB) was added in the reaction mixture. The transcription reaction was incubated for 2 hrs at 37 C. After 2 hrs of reaction time, DNASEI (NEB) and buffer were added to the transcription reaction, and incubated for 15 mins at 37 C. The crude of reaction mix was purified using RNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel). The RNA was denatured at 65° C. for 5 min and then snap chilled to relieve any secondary conformations. For the total 1 mL capping reaction, 1 mg denatured RNA in 700 μL of nuclease-free water was used along with 100 μL 1 (10×) capping buffer, 50 μL (10 mM) GTP, 50 μL (4 mM) SAM, 50 μL of (10 units/μL) Vaccinia capping enzyme, and 50 μL of mRNAcap2'-O-methyltransferase at (50 units/μL) were combined and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. The mixture capped mRNA was purified using RNA purification kit (Macherey-Nagel).
m7G(5')p3-RNA were delivered 0.3 mg/kg i.v. into 12-16 weeks old male mice. Blood samples were collected at 6 hours post dose, and plasma was isolated. Protein expression was performed using ELISA (e.bioscience). Results are shown in FIG. 16.
The results show that the efficiency of transcription using trinucleotide analog ARC CAP1 is substantially improved compared to dinucleotide ARCA. This is because the amount of protein expression for ARC CAP1 is greater than ARCA, and because vaccinia-mediated capping produces m7G(5')p3-RNA that results in comparable protein expression compared to ARC CAP1. ARC CAP1-RNA is just as efficient translated as enzymatically capped RNA.
