BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Technical Field
The present invention relates to a series of novel N-cyclopropyl benzamide compounds, the synthesis of these compounds their use in the treatment of inflammatory disease and pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds
2. Background Information
RIPK2 (also known as RICK, CARDIAK, CARDS, or RIP2) is a dual specific serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase which is a key component of pro-inflammatory signaling through the NOD1 and NOD2 signaling pathways (Inohara et al. 1998; McCarthy et al. 1998; Thome et al. 1998; Tigno-Aranjuez et al. 2010). The NOD receptors are one of the mechanisms for surveillance for intracellular bacterial pathogens. Bacterial cell wall components initiate signals through the NOD1 and NOD2 pathway by the binding of NOD1 bacteria ligands, D-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid, and the NOD2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide, to the appropriate intracellular NOD receptors (Girardin et al. 2003a; Girardin et al. 2003b; Girardin et al. 2003c; Chamaillard et al. 2003; Inohara et al. 2003). This binding induces oligomerization of the NOD protein through homotypic CARD/CARD domain interactions (Inohara et al. 2000; Ogura et al. 2001). This activation of NOD receptors leads to Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of RIPK2 through activation of ubiquitin E3 ligases such as XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 (Krieg et al. 2009; Bertrand et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2007; Hasegawa et al. 2008) and recruits the linear ubiquitin system (LUBAC) (Damgaard et al. 2012; Ver Heul et al. 2013). Additionally, RIPK2 undergoes autophosphorylation of Tyrosine474 as part of its activation and assembly into the NOD signaling complex (Tigno-Aranjuez et al. 2010). Further RIPK2, dependent assembly of the signaling complex results in the activation of IKKα/β/γ and TAK1, leading to activation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (Yang et al. 2007).
Mutations in NOD2 have been linked to multiple diseases. Activating mutations have been linked to Early Onset Sarcoidosis (Kanazawa et al., 2005) and Blau syndrome (Miceli-Richard et al., 2001) which affect skin, joints, and eyes. These activating mutations result in increased basal NF-κB activity (Kanazawa et al., 2005). Loss-of-function mutations in the NOD2 LRR are linked to Crohn's Disease (Ogura et al. 2001; Hugot et al. 2001; Hampe et al. 2001; Hampe 2002; Lesange 2002). In addition, polymorphisms in NOD1 have been linked to atopy (Weidinger et al. 2005) and asthma (Hysi et al. 2005). Additional studies in cellular and in vivo mouse models have suggested a role for NOD1 and NOD2 signaling in a variety of diseases such as Graft vs. Host Disease, Arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis, and Diabetic Nephropathy (Peaneck et al. 2009; Saha et al. 2009; Vieira et al. 2012; Rosenzweig et al. 2010; Joosten et al. 2008; Shaw et al. 2011; Du et al. 2013). Small molecule inhibitors of RIP2 kinase (RIPK2) are disclosed in US2013/0023532 A1 but appear to have limited potency.
Pharmacological inhibition of RIPK2 by a potent and selective small molecule inhibitor will attenuate pro-inflammatory signaling through the bacterial sensing pathways initiated by NOD1 and NOD2 stimulation. This reduction in inflammatory signaling will provide therapeutic benefit in a variety of autoinflammatory diseases. Thus, there is a need for potent inhibitors of RIPK2 for pharmaceutical purposes.

or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
In one embodiment, the invention relates to any of the compounds depicted in Table 1 above and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
For all compounds disclosed hereinabove in this application, in the event the nomenclature is in conflict with the structure, it shall be understood that the compound is defined by the structure. For compounds with stereogenic centers, the structures show the absolute stereochemistry.
The invention also relates to pharmaceutical preparations, containing as active substance one or more compounds of the invention, or the pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, optionally combined with conventional excipients and/or carriers.
Compounds of the invention also include their isotopically-labelled forms. An isotopically-labelled form of an active agent of a combination of the present invention is identical to said active agent but for the fact that one or more atoms of said active agent have been replaced by an atom or atoms having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number of said atom which is usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes which are readily available commercially and which can be incorporated into an active agent of a combination of the present invention in accordance with well established procedures, include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine, e.g., 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively. An active agent of a combination of the present invention, a prodrug thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of either which contains one or more of the above-mentioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms is contemplated to be within the scope of the present invention.
The invention includes the use of any compounds of described above containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms may occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Isomers shall be defined as being enantiomers and diastereomers. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Each stereogenic carbon may be in the R or S configuration, or a combination of configurations.
Some of the compounds of the invention can exist in more than one tautomeric form. The invention includes methods using all such tautomers.
All terms as used herein in this specification, unless otherwise stated, shall be understood in their ordinary meaning as known in the art. For example, “C1-6 alkoxy” is a C1-6 alkyl with a terminal oxygen, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy. All alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl groups shall be understood as being branched or unbranched where structurally possible and unless otherwise specified. Other more specific definitions are as follows:
The term “alkyl” refers to both branched and unbranched alkyl groups. It should be understood that any combination term using an “alk” or “alkyl” prefix refers to analogs according to the above definition of “alkyl”. For example, terms such as “alkoxy”, “alkythio” refer to alkyl groups linked to a second group via an oxygen or sulfur atom. “Alkanoyl” refers to an alkyl group linked to a carbonyl group (C═O).
It shall be understood that if N is not substituted then it is NH. As used herein, “nitrogen” and “sulfur” include any oxidized form of nitrogen and sulfur and the quaternized form of any basic nitrogen. For example, for a -S-C1-6 alkyl radical, unless otherwise specified, shall be understood to include -S(O)-C1-6 alkyl and -S(O)2-C1-6 alkyl.

Assessment of Biological Properties
RIPK2 inhibition for compounds in Table 1 are shown in Table 3 and measured using the following method:
Materials: White, 384-well optiplates (cat.no. 6007290) were purchased from PerkinElmer. The V9103X ADP-Glo Kinase Assay Custom (including ultra-pure ATP) was purchased from Promega. 8His-RIPK2 FL was prepared in-house. All other materials were of highest grade commercially available.
Method: In a 384-well plate, test compound diluted in assay buffer (1%DMSO final) is mixed with 8His-RIPK2 FL enzyme (final concentration of 8 nM). After 15 minutes of pre-incubation at RT, ATP dissolved in assay buffer is added (final concentration 5 μM). The mixture is incubated for 60 minutes at 37° C. in a humidified incubator. Then, ADP Glo Reagent is added, followed by a 40 minute incubation at rt. Finally, Kinase Detection Reagent is added and the entire mixture is incubated for 40 min at RT. The luminescence signal is measured with an Envision reader to determine the amount of ADP produced. Assay buffer: 25 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinethanesulfonic acid), 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2, 50 mM KCl, 0.01% CHAPS (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate), 10 μM Na3VO4, 1 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), pH 7.5 All plates contain wells with vehicle controls instead of compound (1% DMSO) as reference for the high signal (100% CTL(100% of control), high signal), and wells without enzyme as reference for low signal (0% CTL, low signal). The luminescent signal generated is proportional to the ADP produced and is correlated with enzyme activity. The analysis of the data is performed by the calculation of the percentage of ADP production in the presence of the test compound and RIPK2 as compared to the ADP production in the presence of RIPK2 plus 50 μM Gefitinib. (RLU (relative luminescence units) (sample)−RLU(low control))*100/(RLU(high value)−RLU(low control)) [RLU =relative luminescence units].
