Field of the invention
The present invention relates to fluconazole derivatives and their use as antimycotics.
Background of the invention
Fungal infections are triggered by tiny parasites called fungi, present in water, soil, plants, invertebrates and mammalians. Their pathogen colonization can be superficial (cutaneous and subcutaneous level) or systemic. Local infections (e.g. athlete's foot) are contracted by 20-25% of the whole world population. Systemic parasitotis are the 4thmost common cause of bloodstream infections with a lifetime incidence rising up even to 75% (e.g. candidiasis). Even if such dizzying morbidity still does not end up in a high mortality rate, local parasitosis together with invasive fungal infections (IFI) represent nowadays a grave problem, depressing the immune system, increasing the risk of contracting other pathologies and having indeed a deep impact on the whole health system economy. Although potent drugs are involved in antifungal therapy, the infections rate is warningly increasing every year. Moreover, many cases of developed resistance against conventional antimycotics appeared recently, especially for prolonged therapies (several weeks or months). Strangely, instead of observing a strong output in antifungal research, the discovery trend is not following the increment of disease cases. During the second half of 20th century, antifungal-directed research mainly focused on an intensive derivatization of the already accepted compounds (e.g. ketoconazole → fluconazole, AmpB → Nystatin or AmpBlyposomes). Despite these efforts, just seven compounds are nowadays on the list of World Health Organization Essential Medicine (WHO-EM, data of October 2013). Moreover, the benchmark drugs were all discovered almost 20 or more years ago. Novel strategies to fight fungal infections are therefore urgently required.
The drugs Salvarsan (1909 against syphilis) and Cisplatin (1965-1978 against cancer) are undoubtedly the best examples of metal-based drugs which have reached the market. Other Platinum derivatives such as Oxaliplatin and Carboplatin are nowadays involved in chemotherapeutic treatments against several cancers including ovarian, lung and colon carcinoma. Other metal-based compounds containing technetium or gadolinium are also used in the clinics worldwide as imaging agents. Gold complexes are benchmark products against rheumatoid arthritis. An organometallic derivative of the well-known antimalarial drug Chloroquine, namely Ferroquine, has shown extremely promising results as a novel antimalarial drug candidate. These stunning examples of the use of metal complexes contrasts with the relatively low efforts made in the utilization of such compounds in the field of antifungal therapy. Sporadic reports proved the effectiveness of different metals (e.g. Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Pd(ll)) bearing a variety of ligands (e.g. azole moieties, thiosemicarbazones, carboxamides) against several fungal strains.
The two most common antifungal drugs, inscribed in the List of Essential Medicines of the WHO and commercially available, are Clotrimazole and Fluconazole. Both these therapeutics are belonging to the azole class. Fluconazole can be applied topically as well as systemically and is used predominantly for the treatment of Candidiasis. Both those azoles are specifically targeting the enzyme lanosterol-14α-demethylase which plays a central role in the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an important fungal wall component. The inhibition of this protein leads to wall instability and fungal death. Mammalian cells use cholesterol instead of ergosterol which reduces unwanted side effects by inhibition of this enzyme.
The widespread use of Clotrimazole as well as Fluconazole against skin, genital and invasive fungal infections, has given rise to fungal strains with a resistance against these substances. This limits the usability of Clotrimazole and Fluconazole especially in the treatment of Candidiasis.
Based on the above mentioned state of the art, the objective of the present invention is to provide means and methods to use organometallic compounds as antifungal agents, in particular agents able to overcome a resistance against known antifungal agent. This objective is attained by the claims of the present specification.
Summary of the invention
The inventors unexpectedly discovered that the potency of derivatives of Fluconazole comprising an organometallic compound as antifungal agent is vastly increased. Even fungal strains resistant to treatment with Fluconazole can be effectively treated by the compounds of the present invention.
The present invention discloses the organometallic derivatization of Fluconazole with a metallocenyl and in particular a ferrocenyl moiety at the C3 position. The azole group (imidazole, triazole or tetrazole), which is carrying the inhibition activity, and the mono- or disubstituted phenyl group responsible for active site interaction. Without wishing to be bound by theory the metallocenyl derivatization is supposed to play an important role for the overall biodistribution and uptake (increasing the lipophilicity of the parent drug). Moreover, the metal center, in particular the iron center, possesses redox catalytic properties that could alter the antioxidant balance of the target microorganism, enhancing the overall activity with a second additional mode of action.

Examples
Synthesis:
The synthesis of the new antifungal drug candidates was designed in order to minimize the synthetic steps, to involve cheap reagents and to be performed under mild reaction conditions. Starting from the commercially available 2,4-difluoro-a-(1H-1,2,4-triazolyl)acetophenone (CAS number 86404-63-9) a Corey-Chaykovski epoxidation was performed (see Scheme 3). In parallel the N-substituted methylferrocenes were prepared starting from ferrocenylaldheyde upon imine formation and subsequent reduction in presence of NaBH4. Finally, the epoxide ring opening via nucleophilic addition by the N-alkyl-methhylaminoferrocene yielded a series of the compounds of the present invention. Four different alkyl side chains, with R= -H, -methyl, -ethyl or -isopropyl, with increasing degree of hindrance and lipophilicity were envisaged in order to obtain a preliminary structure-activtiy relationship. All complexes were characterized by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance techniques, Mass Spectrometry, Infrared Spectroscopy and their purity assessed via elemental analysis.<img> id-imgb0017.tif </img>
Host cytotoxicity:
In both topic and systemic applications, antimycotic drugs are getting in contact with patient tissues. It is therefore of utmost importance that new drug candidates display a lack of host toxicity. Thus, the antiproliferative effect of the new complexes were investigated in vitro on human retinal pigment epithelial cell (RPE-1-hTert). As expected, fluconazole as a reference substance did not affect cell viability. The compounds of the present invention displayed all IC50 values in the mid-high micromolar range, following the order of potency isopropyl> ethyl > methyl> H (see table 1). This suggested that a decrease in the size of the N-substituent correlates with a decrease in host toxicity.

Antifungal activity:
To evaluate the antifungal acitivty of the new drug candidates, a well-plate based assay was used. The first investigation of antimycotic activity has been performed on a well-known model, namely Candida Robusta. Wild type colony of C. robusta was cultured and diluted to start the growing phase just before treatment and then seeded at different concentrations on the agar terrain poured with different concentrations of the target complexes and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. Interestingly, all complexes displayed a better antifungal activity in comparison with the parent drug (figure 2). Tertiary amines as linkers showed a better profile compared to secondary amines. A small substituent on the N resulted in higher mycotoxicity with R=-methyl resulting in the highest antimycotic activity.
In vivo screening:
In vivo studies were performed on pathological isolated strains. The inventors chose the methyl derivative since it displayed the best in vitro mycotoxicity and a low cytotoxicity against human cells. The compounds of the present invention were tested against Candida albicans, its azole-resistant type and three different pathologic fungi, namely Penicillumpaneum, Aspergillus glaucus and Trichosporonasahi (see table 2). Of utmost interest, the new antifungal drug candidate displayed a very strong activity towards almost all investigated strains (only in the case of A. glaucus was the MIC50 not in the nanomolar range). Moreover, the antimycotic potency of the complex overcomes the values of the parent drug up to a factor of 800 fold (e.g. P.paneum) and was able to overcome azole resistance (e.g. C. albicans resistant strain).

Material and methods
Materials:
All chemicals were of reagent grade quality or better, obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Solvents were used as received or dried over 4 A or 3 A molecular sieves. THF and Et2O were freshly distilled under N2 by employing standard procedures. All syntheses were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques. Instrumentation and methods: 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded in deuterated solvents on a Bruker DRX 400 or AV2 500 at 30 °C. The chemical shifts δ, are reported in ppm. The residual solvent peaks have been used as internal reference. The abbreviations for the peak multiplicities are as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet) and br (broad). Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer spectrum BX TF-IR spectrometer and KBrpresslings were used for solids. Signal intensities are abbreviated w (weak), m (medium), s (strong) and br (5 broad). ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Esquire 6000 or on a Bruker maxis QTOF-MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). LC-MS spectra were measured on an AcquityTM from Waters system equipped with a PDA detector and an auto sampler using an Agilent Zorbax 300SB-C18 analytical column (5.0 µm particle size, 100 A pore size, 150 × 3.0 mm) or an Macherey - Nagel 100 - 5 C18 (3.5 µm particle size, 300 A pore size, 150 × 3.0 mm). This LC was coupled to an Esquire HCT from Bruker (Bremen, Germany) for the MS measurements. The LC run (flow rate: 0.3 mL min-1) was performed with a linear gradient of A (distilled water containing 0.1% v/v formic acid) and B (acetonitrile, Sigma-Aldrich, HPLCgrade), t = 0 min, 5% B; t = 3 min, 5% B; t = 17 min, 100% B; t = 20 min, 100% B; t = 25 min, 15 5% B. High-resolution ESI mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker maxis QTOF-MS instrument (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany). The samples (around 0.5 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 mL of MeCN/H2O 1:1 + 0.1% HCOOH. The solution was then diluted 10:1 and analysed via continuous flow injection at 3 µl.min-1. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive electrospray ionization mode at 4000 V capillary voltage, -500 V 20 endplate offset, with a N2 nebulizer pressure of 0.4 bar and dry gas flow of 4.0 l/min at 180°C. MS acquisitions were performed in the full scan mode in the mass range from m/z 100 to 2000 at 20'000 resolution and 1 scan per second. Masses were calibrated with a 2 mmol/l solution of sodium formate over m/z 158 to 1450 mass range with an accuracy below 2 ppm.
Yeast Culture
Wild type C. robusta was freshly inoculated and cultured in autoclaved YPD buffer containing 2% bacto peptone, 1% bacto yeast extract and 2% glucose anhydrous at 30°C (Kuehner shaker Labtherm, Kuehner Switzerland).
Toxicity towards Fungi
The activity of the compounds of the present invention C. robusta was evaluated via a colony formation assay as described in R. Rubbiani, O. Blacque, G. Gasser, Dalton Trans. 2016, 45, 6619-6626. Briefly, one day before treatment, an aliquot of wild type C. robustawas inoculated in 5 mL YPD buffer solution (see above) and incubated overnight at 30°C. The fungal proliferation was then quantified at 600 nm in a Cary60 UV/Vis (Agilent Technologies). The SC was then seeded at different concentrations of the yeast (representing OD of 0.2, 0.02, 0.002 and 0.0002 for different colony growth rate) in 24-wells plates containing 2 mL growing terrain. The growing terrain was composed of YPD containing 2% of agar, autoclaved and kept at 50°C (water bath, Kotterman AG). Just before use, the growing terrain was treated with increasing concentrations of the compounds of the invention or with fluconazole (used for comparison) and poured into the different wells, before solidification. The treated plates were loaded with C. robusta and incubated for 24 h at 30 °C. The fungal colony formation was monitored with Alpha Digitec camera (Bucher Biotec) and the colony density was calculated with Alphalmager software (v1.3.0.7) with multiplex band analysis mode / single tool. A series of blanks (with the terrain not seeded with C. robusta), negative controls (with the terrain seeded with C. robusta and treated just DMSO as vehicle) and Clotrimazole as a positive control were performed.
Cell Culture
Human fibroblast (MRC-5) and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cell lines were cultured in F-10 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin or DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, respectively, at 37 °C and 6% CO2.
Cytotoxicity studies
Cytotoxicity studies of the compounds of the present invention were performed by a fluorometric cell viability assay using resazurin (Promocell GmbH). Briefly, one day before treatment the cells were plated in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 4 × 103 cells per well in 100 µL. Upon treating the cells with increasing concentrations of the compounds of the present invention, the cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C/6% CO2, the medium was removed, and 100 µL of complete medium containing resazurin (0.2 mg mL-1 final concentration) was added. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C/6% CO2, the fluorescence of the highly red fluorescent resorufin product was quantified at 590 nm emission with 540 nm excitation wavelength using a SpectraMax M5 Microplate Reader. The results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation error of independent experiments.
In vivo Antifungal Activity on Pathological Isolated Strain
Candida strains were tested for their susceptibility to the azole (7 dilution series, ranging from 1 mM to 0.01 mM) following the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing protocol (EUCAST Definitive Document EDef 7.2 Revision, 2012). Briefly, cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium supplied with 2.0% glucose, counted and inoculated at a concentration of 1-5 x 105 CFU/ml. MIC50 values were determined at 530 nm using a spectrophotometer, as the lowest concentration of the drug that resulted in ≥ 50% inhibition of growth relative to the growth control after 48 h incubation.

Examples of further modifications of the compounds of the present invention
Modification of the ligand:
Different organic groups are added to the ferrocene scaffold following standard procedures starting from commercially available ferrocenyl dibromide. The starting material is reacted with PhCH2ONH2 and subsequently alkylated (S. Dey et al., Organometallics, 2015, 34, 3039-3046) obtaining the monoaminomonobromo derivative or with CICOOEt in presence of n-butyl-lithium followed by hydrolysis to obtain the monocarboxylic acid mono bromo derivative. The final organic derivatization is obtained via Friedel-Crafts reaction with the acyl chloride of the target substituent or via nucleophilic substitution as depicted in scheme 4.<img> id-imgb0018.tif </img>
Modification of the metallocenyl moiety
Different metallocenyls are synthesized following standard procedures. Cobaltoceneandruthenocene are commercially available and are halogenated in the presence of Br2 and tert-butyl-lithium. The obtained bromo-metallocenes undergo a microwave-assisted nucleophilic substitution with NaN3 (according toY. Ju etal.,J. Org. Chem.,2006,71, 6697-6700), followed by hydrolysis, resulting in the respective metallocenylcarboxaladheyde (according toPatra et al. Chem. Commun., 2011, 47, 114444-11446). The obtained metallocenylcarboxaladheydeis then reacted with hydroxylamine or alkylamine, reduced with NaBH4 in order to obtain the N-alkyl-methylaminometallocenyl derivatives as depicted in scheme 5.<img> id-imgb0019.tif </img>
