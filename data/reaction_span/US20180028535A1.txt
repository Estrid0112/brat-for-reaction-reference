BACKGROUND
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and the human disease it causes, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), remains a significant global healthcare challenge with an estimated 34 million people living with AIDS. Due to the lack of effective vaccine and the persistence of viral reservoir, management of HIV/AIDS relies heavily on chemotherapy. Unfortunately, only about one in every five infected individuals has the access to antivirals. Therefore, there is always a need and market for novel antivirals against HIV.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The compounds of the various embodiments described herein target HIV integrase, an enzyme essential for viral replication and a validated target for antiviral development. Although there are three integrase inhibitors approved by FDA, their antiviral efficacy will be compromised by HIV's ability to develop resistance. Existing bioactive compounds believed to act as integrase inhibitors, having some efficacy against HIV, include raltegravir, elvitegravir, and dolutegravir (see FIG. 1). Reference is made herein to PCT application PCT/US2011/054916, published as WO2012/047993, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
The expression “effective amount”, when used to describe therapy to an individual suffering from AIDS, refers to the quantity or concentration of a compound of the invention that is effective to inhibit or otherwise act on HIV by means of inhibition of the HIV integrase enzyme, in the individual's tissues wherein HIV involved in the disorder, wherein such inhibition or other action occurs to an extent sufficient to produce a beneficial therapeutic effect.
All single enantiomer, diastereomeric, and racemic forms of a structure are intended, unless a particular stereochemistry or isomeric form is specifically indicated. In several instances though an individual stereoisomer is described among specifically claimed compounds, the stereochemical designation does not imply that alternate isomeric forms are less preferred, undesired, or not claimed. Compounds used in the present invention can include enriched or resolved optical isomers at any or all asymmetric atoms as are apparent from the depictions, at any degree of enrichment. Both racemic and diastereomeric mixtures, as well as the individual optical isomers can be isolated or synthesized so as to be substantially free of their enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners, and these are all within the scope of the invention.
As used herein, the terms “stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. Only stable compounds are contemplated herein.
When a number of carbon atoms in a group, e.g., an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, etc., is specified as a range, each individual integral number representing the number of carbon atoms is intended. For example, recitation of a (C1-C6)alkyl group indicates that the alkyl group can be any of methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, sec-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, etc. It is understood that a specification of a number of carbon atoms must be an integer.
The term “alkyl,” as used herein, refers to substituted or unsubstituted straight chain and branched alkyl groups and cycloalkyl groups having from 1 to 50 carbon atoms (C1-C50; e.g., C10-C30, C12-C18; C1-C20, C1-C10; C1-C8; C1-C6, and C1-C3). Examples of straight chain alkyl groups include those with from 1 to 8 carbon atoms (C1-C8) such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl groups. Examples of branched alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, isopropyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, neopentyl, isopentyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, and isostearyl groups. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl groups.
The term “aryl,” as used herein, refers to substituted or unsubstituted cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that do not contain heteroatoms in the ring. Thus aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, azulenyl, heptalenyl, biphenyl, indacenyl, fluorenyl, phenanthrenyl, triphenylenyl, pyrenyl, naphthacenyl, chrysenyl, biphenylenyl, anthracenyl, and naphthyl groups. In some embodiments, aryl groups contain about 6 to about 18 carbons (C6-C18; e.g., C6-C12; C6-C10; and C12-C18) in the ring portions of the groups. Representative substituted aryl groups can be mono-substituted or substituted more than once, such as, but not limited to, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-substituted phenyl or 2-8 substituted naphthyl groups.
The alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, etc., groups described herein can be substituted or unsubstituted. The term “substituted” as used herein refers to a group (e.g., alkyl and aryl) or molecule in which one or more hydrogen atoms contained thereon are replaced by one or more “substituents.” The term “substituent” as used herein refers to a group that can be or is substituted onto a molecule or onto a group. Examples of substituents include, but are not limited to, a halogen (e.g., F, Cl, Br, and I); an oxygen atom in groups such as hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, aralkyloxy groups, oxo(carbonyl) groups, carboxyl groups including carboxylic acids, carboxylates, and carboxylate esters; a sulfur atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl and aryl sulfide groups, sulfoxide groups, sulfone groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfonamide groups; a nitrogen atom in groups such as amines, hydroxylamines, nitriles, nitro groups, N-oxides, hydrazides, azides, and enamines; and other heteroatoms in various other groups. Non-limiting examples of substituents that can be bonded to a substituted carbon (or other) atom include F, Cl, Br, I, OR, OC(O)N(R)2, CN, NO, NO2, ONO2, azido, CF3, OCF3, R, O (oxo), S (thiono), C(O), S(O), methylenedioxy, ethylenedioxy, N(R)2, SR, SOR, SO2R, SO2N(R)2, SO3R, C(O)R, C(O)C(O)R, C(O)CH2C(O)R, C(S)R, C(O)OR, OC(O)R, C(O)N(R)2, OC(O)N(R)2, C(S)N(R)2, (CH2)0-2N(R)C(O)R, (CH2)0-2N(R)N(R)2, N(R)N(R)C(O)R, N(R)N(R)C(O)OR, N(R)N(R)CON(R)2, N(R)SO2R, N(R)SO2N(R)2, N(R)C(O)OR, N(R)C(O)R, N(R)C(S)R, N(R)C(O)N(R)2, N(R)C(S)N(R)2, N(COR)COR, N(OR)R, C(═NH)N(R)2, C(O)N(OR)R, or C(═NOR)R, wherein R can be, for example, hydrogen, alkyl, acyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, or heteroarylalkyl.
The term “acyl” as used herein refers to a group containing a carbonyl moiety wherein the group is bonded via the carbonyl carbon atom. The carbonyl carbon atom is also bonded to another carbon atom, which can be part of a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, aryl, aralkyl cycloalkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, heterocyclyl, heterocyclylalkyl, heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl group or the like. In the special case wherein the carbonyl carbon atom is bonded to a hydrogen, the group is a “formyl” group, an acyl group as the term is defined herein. An acyl group can include 0 to about 12-40, 6-10, 1-5 or 2-5 additional carbon atoms bonded to the carbonyl group. An acryloyl group is an example of an acyl group. An acyl group can also include heteroatoms within the meaning here. A nicotinoyl group (pyridyl-3-carbonyl) is an example of an acyl group within the meaning herein. Other examples include acetyl, benzoyl, phenylacetyl, pyridylacetyl, cinnamoyl, and acryloyl groups and the like. When the group containing the carbon atom that is bonded to the carbonyl carbon atom contains a halogen, the group is termed a “haloacyl” group. An example is a trifluoroacetyl group.
The term “aralkyl,” “arylalkyl,” and “aryl-alkyl” as used herein refers to alkyl groups as defined herein in which a hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to an aryl group as defined herein. Representative aralkyl groups include benzyl and phenylethyl groups.
The term “heteroaralkyl” and “heteroarylalkyl” as used herein refers to alkyl groups as defined herein in which a hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to a heteroaryl group as defined herein.
The term “heterocyclyl” as used herein refers to substituted or unsubstituted aromatic and non-aromatic ring compounds containing 3 or more ring members, of which, one or more is a heteroatom such as, but not limited to, N, O, and S. Thus, a heterocyclyl can be a cycloheteroalkyl, or a heteroaryl, or if polycyclic, any combination thereof. In some embodiments, heterocyclyl groups include 3 to about 20 ring members, whereas other such groups have 3 to about 15 ring members. In some embodiments, heterocyclyl groups include heterocyclyl groups that include 3 to 8 carbon atoms (C3-C8), 3 to 6 carbon atoms (C3-C6) or 6 to 8 carbon atoms (C6-C8). A heterocyclyl group designated as a C2-heterocyclyl can be a 5-ring with two carbon atoms and three heteroatoms, a 6-ring with two carbon atoms and four heteroatoms and so forth. Likewise a C4-heterocyclyl can be a 5-ring with one heteroatom, a 6-ring with two heteroatoms, and so forth. The number of carbon atoms plus the number of heteroatoms equals the total number of ring atoms. A heterocyclyl ring can also include one or more double bonds. A heteroaryl ring is an embodiment of a heterocyclyl group. The phrase “heterocyclyl group” includes fused ring species including those that include fused aromatic and non-aromatic groups. Representative heterocyclyl groups include, but are not limited to piperidynyl, piperazinyl, morpholinyl, furanyl, pyrrolidinyl, pyridinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, triazinyl, thiophenyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, imidazolyl, triazyolyl, tetrazolyl, benzoxazolinyl, and benzimidazolinyl groups.
Salts can be “pharmaceutically-acceptable salts.” The term “pharmaceutically-acceptable salt” refers to salts which possess toxicity profiles within a range that affords utility in pharmaceutical applications. Pharmaceutically unacceptable salts may nonetheless possess properties such as high crystallinity, which have utility in the practice of the present invention, such as for example utility in process of synthesis, purification or formulation of compounds of the invention. “Pharmaceutically or pharmacologically acceptable” include molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward reaction when administered to an animal, or a human, as appropriate. For human administration, preparations should meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and general safety and purity standards as required by FDA Office of Biologics standards.
A “hydrate” is a compound that exists in a composition with water molecules. The composition can include water in stoichiometric quantities, such as a monohydrate or a dihydrate, or can include water in random amounts. As the term is used herein a “hydrate” refers to a solid form, i.e., a compound in water solution, while it may be hydrated, is not a hydrate as the term is used herein. Compounds of the invention or compounds used for practicing a method of the invention can be in the form of a hydrate.
A “solvate” is a similar composition except that a solvent other that water replaces the water. For example, methanol or ethanol can form an “alcoholate,” which can again be stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric. As the term is used herein a “solvate” refers to a solid form, i.e., a compound in solution in a solvent, while it may be solvated, is not a solvate as the term is used herein. Compounds of the invention or compounds used for practicing a method of the invention can be in the form of a solvate, e.g., of an alcohol or the like.
HIV/AIDS remains a significant global healthcare challenge with an estimated 34 million people living with AIDS. Due to the lack of effective vaccine and the persistence of viral reservoir, management of HIV/AIDS relies heavily on chemotherapy. Currently there are numerous FDA-approved drugs of five different classes in HIV antiviral repertoire: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) that typically form the backbone of all treatment regimens; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs); protease inhibitors (PIs); Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitor (INSTIs); and entry inhibitors. As successful as HIV chemotherapies have been in transforming HIV/AIDS into a clinically manageable disease, they can also be easily plagued by the inevitable selection of resistant viral strains. Therefore, sustained success in HIV chemotherapy requires novel antivirals with structurally unique pharmacophore cores. Previously-developed chemotypes featuring a 3-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4-dione core1-3 have shown broad antiviral activities against HIV-1, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV) by targeting RT and IN (HIV), RNase H (HIV and HBV), NS5B polymerase (HCV).
Some embodiments described herein that have a 3-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4-dione scaffold with a unique C5 carboxamide moiety demonstrate extraordinary antiviral potencies against HIV-1, and that the antiviral activity could be linked to potent and specific inhibition of INST.

Compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a person of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis using the procedures provided below in the Examples in conjunction with ordinary skill and knowledge.
Compounds of formula (I) (e.g., target compounds 7) were prepared via a concise and diverse synthetic route shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis started from commercially available hydroxyurea 1 which was O-benzylated with BnBr in the presence of KOH at reflux condition to provide 1-(benzyloxy)urea 2 in high yield.4 Cyclocondensation of 1-(benzyloxy)urea 2 and diethyl malonate provided six-membered herterocycle compound 3-(benzyloxy)-6-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione 3 in moderate yield under microwave irradiation condition (150° C., 20 min) or under conventional heating (reflux, overnight).5 Compound 3 was converted to key intermediate 3-(benzyloxy)-6-chloropyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione 4 in 88% yield by reacting with POCl3 in the presence of BnEt3NCl.6 Reaction of intermediate chloride 4 with amine in the presence of N,N-dimethylaniline under microwave condition provided 6-amination product 5 in moderate to good yield.7 The key carboxamide 6 was achieved via reacting 6-amino intermediate 5 with isocyanates or acylazide under microwave irradiation condition using nitrobenzene as solvent for a short time (210° C., 20-40 min, 60-100%) (Scheme 1),8 a highly efficient method for small scale reaction. The final debenzylation of compounds 6 was achieved by treating with TFA under microwave condition9 or via catalytic hydrogenation.
Alternatively, preparation of the carboxamide intermediate 6 can be achieved via a two-step reaction sequence (scheme 2). In this case, the amino intermediate 5 was treated with phenyl chloroformate and a base, such as pyridine, to give intermediate phenyl ester 8 which was converted amide 6 upon reacting with a primary amine under conventional heating or microwave conditions. Debenzylation with the same protocol afforded the desired chemotype 7.
For compounds of chemotype 7, compound bearing a non-hydrogen substituent on the pyrimidine nitrogen atom not bearing the hydroxyl group (i.e., a compound of formula (I) or of formula (IA) wherein R3 is (C1-C6)alkyl, or (C6-C12)aryl), the sequence can be carried out in the same manner, except replacing intermediate 2 with an analogous intermediate bearing an alkyl or an aryl group on the carboxamido nitrogen atom that does not bear the O-Bn group. This can provide intermediate 5 bearing the alkyl or aryl substituent on the corresponding pyrimidine nitrogen atom. i.e., group R3 of formula (I) or of formula (IA).
Antiviral Testing.
The antiviral activity of newly synthesized analogues of chemotype 7 was evaluated against HIV-1IIIB in CEM-SS cells using an assay based on viral cytopathic effect (CPE). In this assay, the reduction of CPE was used to indicate the antiviral activity of a compound. All selected compounds were first screened under a single concentration (10 μM) and the results are summarized in Table 1. The most striking structure-activity-relationship (SAR) was that analogues with an aromatic amine at the C5 position (R1=aryl, 7-i-7-iv, Table 1) were completely inactive and severely cytotoxic, whereas a small aliphatic amine substitution at the same position (R1=alkyl, 7-v-7-xxiv, Table 1) conferred excellent antiviral activity without cytotoxicity, with the lone exception being the isopropylamino analogue (7-viii) which was inactive and cytotoxic. In addition, among all small alkyl groups for R1, the ethyl group appeared to be optimal for antiviral potency. As far as the R2 group is concerned, a mono- or disubstituted benzyl group appeared to benefit antiviral potency the most. Replacing the phenyl ring with an alkyl group in the carboxamide moiety (7-xxvii, R2═CH2CH2Cl, Table 1) completely abrogated antiviral activity. Interestingly, antiviral activity was largely retained when an extra methylene group was added between the benzyl group and the carboxamide functionality (7-xxvi, Table 1), while deleting the methylene group of the benzyl group (7-xxv, Table 1) caused a complete loss of activity, suggesting that target binding by this terminal aromatic group requires structural flexibility.

Compounds 7-xxix-7-xxxv have an INST IC50 of greater than about 100 μM.
To better gauge the antiviral potency, selected inhibitors with excellent CPE reduction and cell viability from this screening assay were further tested in a dose response fashion, from which the EC50 and CC50 were determined (Table 2). Remarkably all compounds tested showed nanomolar activity and five of the eight analogues were active in low nanomolar range (EC50=15-61 nM), clearly demonstrating an antiviral potency comparable to that of FDA-approved AZT (NRTI) and raltegravir (RAL, INSTI). Although these analogues showed mild cytotoxicity in the range of 18-58 μM, the selectivity window (Table 2), particularly that for analogues 7-xvii (TI=1500) and 7-xxiii (TI=1200), is sufficiently large to warrant their further development.

Antiviral Mechanism of Action
The structures shown below depict FDA-approved INSTIs (9-11) and one compound of the various embodiments described herein, namely, inhibitor 7-xvi. Each approved drug features a chelating triad (red) and a terminal benzyl group (blue) that constitute the pharmacophore of HIV-1 INSTIs. 7-xvi fits the pharmacophore with the same two structural features.
Chemotype 7 was rationally designed to selectively inhibit HIV-1 INST which is critical to HIV infection and the establishment of proviral latency10-12 and represent a particular attractive target due to the lack of host cellular counterpart. In addition, IN uses the same active site (DD35E motif) for both the 3' processing and the ST steps and its inhibitors could benefit from a potentially high genetic barrier to resistance development. Selective ST inhibitors (STIs) all feature a diketoacid (DKA) functionality or its heterocyclic bioisosteres13-17 along with a hydrophobic terminal benzyl moiety,18-23 as demonstrated by all three FDA-approved INSTIs (FIG. 1): raltegravir (RAL, 9)24, 25, elvitegravir (EVG, 10),26 and dolutegravir (DTG, 11)27, 28 which is a second-generation INSTI.29 Significantly, chemotype 7 has the two structural determinants essential for INST binding and inhibition (FIG. 1). The overall shape and functionalities of 7 are particularly reminiscent to DTG, suggesting that the compounds of the various embodiments described herein can be second generation INSTIs. It is also noteworthy that the compounds of the various embodiments described herein a significant smaller “size” (MW for 7xvi=322; the MW for drugs 9-11 is in the range of 419-448) while supporting antiviral activities comparable to RAL and AZT (Table 2). This will allow significant room for optimization during further development. Nevertheless, all analogues for chemotype 7 were tested in a ST assay and the results are summarized in Table 3.

The ST assay results clearly indicate a close correlation between the biochemical inhibition and antiviral activity. Amazingly all analogues that were highly active in the antiviral assay were found to inhibit INST in low nanomolar range, whereas none of the inactive compounds (7i-7iv, and 7xxvii) from the antiviral assay inhibited ST. Even for the active analogues, the most potent ones (7xxii, 7xx, 7xvii, 7xvi and 7vi) from antiviral assay (EC50=15-61 nM, Table 2) also inhibited ST the best (IC50=21-77 nM, Table 5). These observations strongly support the inhibition of INST as the mechanism of action for chemotype 7.
Mechanism of Strand Transfer Inhibition
HIV IN is a 32-kDa protein encoded by viral pol gene consisting of three functional domains30: the N-terminal domain (NTD) with a conserved “HH-CC” zinc-binding motif; the catalytic core domain (CCD) containing the key D64-D116-E152 catalytic triad; and the C-terminal domain (CTD) important for DNA binding. Although crystal structures of each single domain as well as double domains had been reported;31-33 detailed understanding on HIV INST catalysis and inhibition remained elusive until the disclosure of crystal structures of full-length IN and viral DNA complex (intasome) for a homologous prototype foamy virus (PFV).34, 35 Homologous models36, 37 constructed based on these PFV intasome crystal structures have provided valuable details into HIV INST mechanism of action and formed the basis for structure-based INSTI design. Significantly these models corroborate the minimal pharmacophore embedded in major INSTIs as shown in FIG. 1.
FIG. 2 shows molecular docking on a representative analogue 7-xvi using a homologous HIV IN model.36 Significantly, the new inhibitor 7-xvi fits perfectly into the IN binding site through two major binding domains also featured in DTG (11): the chelation of two Mg2+ ions, and the placement of the 4-F-benzyl group into the protein-DNA interfacial hydrophobic pocket (FIG. 2). The high degree of similarity shown between the binding of 7-xvi and 11 confirms that the compounds of the various embodiments described herein can effectively engage with HIV IN to inhibit ST.
Resistance.
Mutations conferring resistance to INSTIs have been generated in cell culture and emerged in clinical studies.38-40 To establish the resistance profile of chemotype 7, a representative compound 7xxiii was evaluated for antiviral potency against four RAL-resistant HIV-1 clones.41 These clones contain one or more major mutations in HIV-1 IN that are associated with raltegravir resistance,23, 24 namely a Y143C or an N155H single mutation; a G140S/Q148H double mutation and a G140S/Y143H/Q148H triple mutation. AZT and RAL were included in the study for comparison purpose. The results are summarized in Table 4. Obviously there is no cross-resistance for AZT due to a totally different mechanism of action. Interestingly compound 7-xxiii retains its potency against both single mutants (clones 1556-1 and 4736-2) while the double mutant (clone 8070-1) and the triple mutant (clone 8070-1) HIV-1 clones demonstrated moderate resistance to 7-xxiii, with a fold resistance of 13 and 6.3, respectively. These results suggest that chemotype 7 may confer antiviral activity via inhibiting INST, and that its binding mode to IN may be much similar to that of DTG (11), a second generation INSTI active against RAL-resistant HIV-1 strains.42

In Vitro Pharmacokinetics (PK)/ADME
To assess drug-like properties of chemotype 7, selected analogues were tested in various in vitro ADME studies (Table 5). Aqueous stability and solubility were evaluated in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS). No degradation was observed with selected compounds in DPBS (37° C.) over a 24 h period with the exception of 7-xxii, which degraded slightly (86% remaining). In addition, all compounds were found to have good thermodynamic solubility in DPBS. Assessment of plasma and microsomal stability as well as plasma protein binding was done in two species, human and mouse. All compounds were found to be stable in both human and mouse plasma over 24 h at 37° C. However, these compounds showed a very high protein binding in human plasma (˜99%). In mouse plasma, the protein binding was lower (70.9˜95.9%). Microsomal stability of the compounds were evaluated in liver microsomes using either NADPH (phase I) or UDPGA (phase II) as cofactor. All the compounds were found to be stable against phase I NADPH-dependent metabolism but were subjected to fast phase II metabolic glucuronidation (Table 5).

Biology
INST Assay.
HIV integrase was expressed and purified as previously reported.43 Inhibition assays were performed using a modified protocol of a reported method.43 Briefly, 2.1 μL of compound suspended in DMSO was placed in duplicate into a Black 96 well non-binding plate (coming 3991). Compounds were plated in duplicate to a final concentration of 0.13-100 μM. To each well of the plate 186.9 μL of reaction mixture without DNA substrate was added (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% glycerol w/v, 10 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 μM integrase). The enzyme was incubated with inhibitor for 10 min at 25° C. after which the reaction was initiated by the addition of 21 μL of 500 nM oligo (5' biotin ATGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA annealed with ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAT 3' Cy5). Reactions were incubated at 37° C. for 30 min and then quenched by the addition of 5.2 μL 500 mM EDTA. Each reaction was moved (200 μL) to a MultiScreen HTS PCR plate (Millipore MSSLBPC10) containing 20 μL streptavidin agarose beads (Life Technologies S951) and incubated with shaking for 30 min. A vacuum manifold was used to remove the reaction mixture and the beads were similarly washed 3 times with wash buffer (0.05% SDS, 1 mM EDTA in PBS). The plates were further washed 3 times with 200 μL 50 mM NaOH to denature DNA not covalently linked to the biotin modification. For each denaturation step the plate was incubated with shaking at 25° C. for 5 min and the NaOH was removed by centrifugation at 1000 g for 1 min. The reaction products were eluted from the beads by the addition of 150 μL formamide. The plate was incubated at 25° C. for 10 min and read directly at 635/675 in a SpectraMax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Expression and purification of the recombinant IN in Escherichia coli were performed as previously reported39, 44 with addition of 10% glycerol to all buffers. Preparation of oligonucleotide substrates has been described.45 Integrase reactions were performed in 10 μL with 400 nM of recombinant IN, 20 nM of 5'-end [32P]-labeled oligonucleotide substrate and inhibitors at various concentrations. Solutions of 10% DMSO without inhibitors were used as controls. Reactions were incubated at 37° C. (60 minutes) in buffer containing 50 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 7.5 mM MgCl2, and 14.3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μL of loading dye (10 mM EDTA, 98% deionized formamide, 0.025% xylene cyanol and 0.025% bromophenol blue). Reactions were then subjected to electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gels. Gels were dried and reaction products were visualized and quantitated with a Typhoon 8600 (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK). Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageQuant from Molecular Dynamics Inc. The concentrations at which enzyme activity was reduced by 50% (IC50) were determined using “Prism” software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, Calif.) for nonlinear regression to fit dose-response data to logistic curve models.
HIV-1 Antiviral Assay.
The HIV Cytoprotection assay used CEM-SS cells and the IIIB strain of HIV-1. Briefly virus and cells were mixed in the presence of test compound and incubated for 6 days. The virus was pre-titered such that control wells exhibit 70 to 95% loss of cell viability due to virus replication. Therefore, antiviral effect or cytoprotection was observed when compounds prevent virus replication. Each assay plate contained cell control wells (cells only), virus control wells (cells plus virus), compound toxicity control wells (cells plus compound only), compound colorimetric control wells (compound only) as well as experimental wells (compound plus cells plus virus). Cytoprotection and compound cytotoxicity were assessed by MTS (CellTiter® 96 Reagent, Promega, Madison Wis.) and the EC50 (concentration inhibiting virus replication by 50%), CC50 (concentration resulting in 50% cell death) and a calculated TI (therapeutic index CC50/EC50) were provided. Each assay included AZT as a positive control.
Modeling and Docking.
All modeling study was carried out using schrodinger modeling suite46 based on a homology model36 of HIV-1 IN CCD-DNA complex using Glide with standard precision protocol.47 The Mg2+ ions and the interfacial hydrophobic pocket between the HIV-1 IN and DNA were defined as required constraints. The van der Waals radii of non-polar atoms for each of the ligands were scaled by a factor of 0.8 to account for structure variability to specific ligand binding.
