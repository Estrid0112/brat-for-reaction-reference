Technical Field
The invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound inhibiting the activity of a cyclin-dependent kinase(CDK) and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same as an effective ingredient.
Background Art
A cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) is a serine/threonine kinase and binds to a cyclin to form a complex which has kinase activity and substrate specificity. A CDK is known as a kinase regulating the cell cycle through an interaction with various cyclins. Further, a CDK is also involved in transcription regulation, epigenetic regulation, metabolism regulation, stem cell self-renewal, neuronal function, etc. (Lim S, et al., Development, 2013, 140(15): 3079-93).
There are 16 CDK isotypes and they play an important role in the cell cycle regulation or transcription regulation depending on the isotype. In particular, CDK1 and CDK2 among CDKs regulating the cell cycle play an important role in a mitosis. CDK2 induces DNA synthesis in S phase and the progression through the cell cycle. CDK1 is involved in the formation of many factors to drive M phase. Accordingly, abnormality of a CDK may cause various cancers. An anticancer agent targeted to CDK abnormality will be effective in treating blood cancers including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin's lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and solid cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, pancreas cancer, glioma, colon cancer, breast cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, liver cancer, melanoma, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, biliary tract cancer, gallbladder cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, esophageal cancer, etc. (Pitts TM, et al., Pharmacol Ther., 2014, 142(2): 58-69).
CDK5, which is not involved in the regulation of the cell cycle or a transcription, is mostly distributed in a brain, and is activated by binding to p25 which is stable in a cell, resulting in continuous activity and thus various degenerative brain diseases. A substance inhibiting CDK5 activity will be useful for treating Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's chorea. In particular, Alzheimer's disease is caused by the neurodegeneration which is the result of the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and amyloid plaques, and CDK5 is important for their formation. CDK5 phosphorylates the serin or threonine residues at Thr181, Ser199, Ser202, Thr212, Ser214, Thr231, Ser235, Ser396, and Ser404 of tau protein and tau protein hyperphosphorylated by CDK5 forms a neurofibrillary tangle (NFT). Amyloid plaque is formed by accumulation of Aβ(amyloid beta protein) which is produced by degradation of Amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the aspartic proteases, β-secretase and γ-secretase, in a brain. In this regard, CDK5 phosphorylates Thr668 residue of APP so that APP can be degraded by β-secretase. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a compound which can inhibit CDK5 activity and thus prevent and treat degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease cuased by excessive action of CDK5 (Cruz JC, et al., Trends Mol Med., 2004, 10(9): 452-8).

Experimental Example 1 : Analysis for inhibition of CDK enzyme activity
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention inhibit the activities of CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, CDK5, and CDK6 which are isotypes of a CDK.
Test compounds were prepared by dissolving the compounds obtained in the above Examples in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 10 mM. The test compounds were diluted to 200 nM, 50 nM, 1.5 nM, 3.13 nM, 0.78 nM, and 0.2 nM and used in an enzyme reaction.
CDK enzyme reaction was conducted in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM DTT. CDK1/cyclinB, CDK2/cylcinE, CDK5/p25, and CDK6/cyclinD3 enzymes commercially available from Merck Millipore were used for CDK1, CDK2, CDK5, and CDK6 enzymes, respectively, and CDK4/cyclinD1 enzyme commercially available from Signalchem (US) was used for CDK4. For CDK1, a reaction proceeded by adding 10 nM CDK1/cyclinB and 0.125 mg/ml histone H1 (Merck Millipore) substrate to the buffer and then adding 10 µM ATP thereto. For CDK2, a reaction was proceeded by adding 10 nM CDK2/cyclinE and 0.125 mg/ml histone H1 substrate to the buffer and then adding 10 µM ATP thereto. For CDK5, a reaction was proceeded by adding 10 nM CDK5/p25 and 0.125 mg/ml histone H1 substrate to the buffer and then adding 10 µM ATP thereto. For CDK4, a reaction was proceeded by adding 20 nM CDK4/cyclinD1 and 0.125 mg/ml Rb protein (Merck Millipore) to the buffer and then adding 10 µM ATP thereto. For CDK6, a reaction was proceeded by adding 50 nM CDK6/cyclinD3 and 0.125 mg/ml histone H1 substrate to the buffer and then adding 10 µM ATP thereto. Each enzyme reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Then, the amount of ADP produced was measured using Victor X4 instrument (Perkin Elmer) after generating luminescence using ADP-Glo kinase assay kit (Promega, US). An inhibition effect on each enzyme was represented as a percentage of the luminescence value in the presence of the test compounds relative to the luminescence value without the test compounds. IC50 (nM) is the concentration of the compound to inhibit 50% of the enzyme activity. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

Experimental Example 2 : Analysis for inhibition of cancer cell proliferation
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention inhibit a cancer cell proliferation and thus exhibit anticancer effect. A test was conducted to confirm whether the compounds obtained in the above Examples can inhibit proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116, glioblastoma cell lines U-87MG and T98G, neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y and SK-N-SH, and lung cancer cell lines A549 and NCI-H23.
HCT116, U-87MG, SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH and A549 cells were culured in DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS. T98G cells were cultured in MEM medium containing 10 % FBS and NCI-H23 cells were cultured in RPMI1664 medium containing 10 % FBS. In order to analyze an inhibition of proliferation, HCT116 cells were dispensed in 2000 cells/well into 96 well plate, and SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, U-87MG, T98G, A549, and NCI-H23 cells were dispensed in 3000 cells/well into 96 well plate. And then, the cells were cultured at 5 % CO2 and 37 °C for 16 hrs to allow the cells to attach to the wells. The compounds of the above Examples were added to each well at a concentration of 0.004, 0.013, 0.04, 0.12, 0.37, 1.1, 3.3, and 10 µM, and the culture volume was adjusted to 100 µl. A control group was treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at the same concentration, 0.08 %, as used to treat the test compounds. Afterwards, cells were cultured at 5 % CO2 and 37 °C for 72 hrs. And then, 10 µl of the solution of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) dissolved in PBS at 5 mg/ml was added to each well to identify viable cells and the cells were cultured for further 2 hrs. The culture solution was removed, 100 µl of DMSO was added to dissolve the formed formazan and then an absorbance was measured at 535 nm. Based on the absorbance of the control cells not treated with the compounds, the amounts of the viable cells according to the concentration of the compounds were calculated. GI50 (growth inhibition 50) value which is the concentration of the compound to inhibit cancer cell proliferation by 50 % was calculated using Graphpad Prism 5.0 program. The results are shown in Table 2 below.

As shown in Table 2 above, the compounds according to the present invention can effectively inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Since the compounds effectively inhibit neuroblastoma and glioblastoma as well as colon cancer cells and lung cancer cells, the compounds may be effectively used to treat brain tumor.
Experimental Example 3 : Analysis for the cell cycle change
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention arrest the cell cycle of a cancer cell in G2/M phase.
A human colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 and a human normal lung cell line MRC5 were cultured in DMEM medium containing 10 % FBS. Each cultured cells were harvested, placed in 6 well plate at 1 × 106 cells/well, and cultured at 5 % CO2 and 37 °C for 16 hrs. The compounds of the above Examples at 75 nM and 150 nM in DMEM containing 5 % FBS were added to the cells in each well, and after 24 hrs a change in the cell cycle was analyzed using a flow cytometry. Media of treatment groups and a control group were removed, trypsin was added to isolate cells from the plates and the cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 3 min. The isolated cells were washed with a cold phosphate buffer (PBS) two times. Afterwards, 1 ml of 70 % ethanol was added to the cells and the cells were maintained at 4 °C for 30 min or more to fix the cells. The fixed cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 3 min to remove ethanol, and washed with phosphate buffer (PBS) two times to remove ethanol completely. The washed cells were suspended in 250 µl of PBS, 6.25 µl of 10 mg/ml RNaseA was added to the suspension and reacted for 15 min at room temperature to degrade all RNA. 12.5 µl of 1 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI, sigma) was added to stain intracellular DNA. The cell cycles of 10 000 stained cells were measured using FACS calibur (Becton-Dickinson, USA) and cell numbers present in G1, S and G2/M phases were calculated as percentage using a cell cycle analysis program. Tables 3 and 4 show the results of cell cycle analysis for the compound obtained in Example 1 in cancer cells and normal cells, respectively.

The above Tables 3 and 4 and Fig. 1 show that the compounds according to the present invention effectively arrest the cell cycle of a cancer cell in G2/M phase. In particular, while the compound at low concentration of 75 nM arrested the cell cycle of the colon carcinoma cell line HCT116 in G2/M phase, the normal cell line MRC5 showed the cell cycle similar to the control group even at 150 nM of the compound. Therefore, it is expected that the compounds according to the present invention may kill a cancer cell by arresting the cell cycle of the cancer cells in G2/M phase, but may not affect the cell cycle of a normal cell and thus be safe.
Experimental Example 4 : Analysis for tumor growth inhibition in an animal model
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention inhibit a tumor growth in an animal model injected with cancer cells. Human colon carcinoma HCT116 cell line of 5 × 106 cells/0.1 ml (Matrigel: PBS = 6:4) was injected subcutaneously into the right flank of a Balb/c nude mouse. When a tumor grew to 220 mm3, 5 mice were assigned for each group so that tumor sizes of all groups are consistent and a test compound was orally administered daily for 12 days. Tumor size was measured twice a week using Caliper. The test compound was the one obtained in Example 61 at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg. A vehicle control was 20 % propylene glycol (PG) and a positive control was Xeloda at 100 mg/kg. Tumor size (volume) was calculated from the tumor length measured in each animal using the following Equation 1.<img> id-imgb0139.tif </img>Tumor volume=length of major axis×length of minor axis2/2
Table 5 below andFig. 2 show the actual tumor sizes measured over time and the tumor growth inhibition, TGI (%) based on the tumor size for each group compared to the vehicle control group.

</table>
As shown in the above Table 5 and Fig. 2, after the end of administration, Xeloda at 100 mg/kg used as a positive control exhibited 46 % tumor growth inhibition compared to the tumor size of the vehicle control. However, the compound of Example 61 at 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, and 30 mg/k exhibited 41.3 %, 58.0 %, 64.9 %, and 78.1 % tumor growth inhibition, respectively, and therefore showed a superior tumor growth inhibition effect compared to Xeloda used as a positive control.
Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds according to the present invention may exhibit a superior anticancer effect against various cancers including colon cancer.
Experimental Example 5 : Analysis for tumor growth inhibition by combined administration in an animal model
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention exhibit synergistic anticancer effect by combined administration in an animal model injected with a tumor cell.
Human glioblastoma U-87MG cell line of 5 × 106 cells/0.1 ml PBS was injected subcutaneously into the right flank of a Balb/c nude mouse. When a tumor grew to 150 mm3, 5 mice were assigned for each group so that tumor sizes of all groups are consistent and a test compound was orally administered daily. Tumor size was measured three times a week using Caliper. The test compound was the one obtained in Example 61 at 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg. Temozolomide (TMZ) at 2.5 mg/kg as a positive control was orally administered daily for the first 5 days. Further, in order to analyze the effect of combined administration of TMZ and the compound of Example 61, a tumor growth inhibition test was conducted with the group of TMZ at 2.5 mg/kg combined with the compound of Example 61 at 15 mg/kg and the group of TMZ at 2.5 mg/kg combined with the compound of Example 61 at 30 mg/kg. For the combined administration, TMZ was orally administered daily for the first 5 days. For the single administration, the compound of Example 61 was orally administered daily for 30 days. For the combined administration, the compound of Example 61 was administered orally daily for 34 days. 20 % propylene glycol (PG) was used as a vehicle control. Tumor size (volume) was calculated from the tumor length measured in each animal using the following Equation 1.<img> id-imgb0140.tif </img>Tumor volume=length of major axis×length of minor axis2/2
Table 6 below andFig. 3 show the actual tumor sizes measured over time and the tumor growth inhibition, TGI (%) based on the tumor size for each group compared to the vehicle control group.

6 & TMZ 2.5 mpk + Example 61 - 30 mpk & 5.0 ± 5.0 & 99.9
</table>
As shown in the above Table 6 and Fig. 3, the compound of Example 61 administered alone at 15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg exhibited 16.8 % and 52.2 % tumor growth inhibition, respectively, compared to the tumor size of the vehicle control administered for 30 days. Further, TMZ administered alone at 2.5 mg/kg appeared to diminish the tumor, but the tumor started to grow again after 23 days. The compound of Example 61 administered at 15 mg/kg in combination with TMZ diminished a tumor, but the tumor started to grow again after 32 days. However, the compound of Example 61 administered at 30 mg/kg in combination with TMZ diminished the tumor and there was no tumor growth until 34 days. Thus, it is confirmed that the compound of Example 61 has an anticancer effect to inhibit tumor growth of glioblastoma. Further, while temozolomide (TMZ) is used as a medication for treating glioblastoma, it is administered for 5 days only in 28 day cycle administration since its efficacy is weak and it exhibits severe side effects due to cytotoxicity. It is confirmed that the compound of Example 61 combined with TMZ has a synergistic tumor growth inhibitory effect and delays recurrence of cancer cells.
Accordingly, the compounds according to the present invention may be used in combination with various anticancer agents including a molecular targeted agent, a cytotoxic agent or a hormonal agent as well as in a single therapy. Also, it is expected that the compound will exhibit a superior anticancer effect in brain tumor treatment.
Experimental Example 6 : Analysis for blood brain barrier permeation
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention penetrate the blood brain barrier and migrate into a brain.
Using 9-week-old male ICR mice, the compounds obtained in the above Examples were orally administered once at a dose of 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg, and after 1 hr and 4 hrs, the concentrations of the compounds in the blood and brain of the mice were determined. 3 ICR mice were assigned in each group. Plasma was separated from the blood obtained after sacrificing the mice at each time, the brain of the mice was extracted, and the blood was washed with PBS, followed by pulverizing the brain tissue. The blood was placed in a test tube containing heparin to prevent coagulation and then was centrifuged at 12 000 rpm at 4 °C for 3 min to give a supernatant from which plasma was collected. Brain tissue was weighed, and the brain was pulverized using Dounce's homogenizer after adding 3 times as much volume of PBS as the brain weight. Each of the obtained analytical samples was quantitatively analyzed using a tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometer (Tandem LC/MS/MS, API3000 & Agilent 1100 series). Brain permeability of a compound is expressed as a value obtained by dividing the concentration of the compound in the brain by the concentration of the compound in the plasma (B/P ratio), and when the B/P ratio is greater than 1, it means that the concentration in the brain is higher than the one in the blood.
Table 7 below shows B/P ratios for the representative compounds obtained in Examples.

</table>
As shown in Table 7, the compounds according to the present invention exhibit B/P ratio greater than 1. Accordingly, it is confirmed that the compounds according to the present invention may penetrate into a brain through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after orally adminstrated. Further, in consideration of that the concentrations of the compound in the brain decreases after 4 hrs, it is confirmed that the compounds in a brain do not accumulate but have clearance similar to that in blood.
Accordingly, it is expected that the compounds according to the present invention may penetrate into a brain through the BBB and thus exhibit superior effect in the treatment of brain tumor and degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.
Experimental Example 7 : Analysis for inhibition of Tau phosphorylation
Western blot experiments were carried out as follows to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention can inhibit phosphorylation of tau protein.
SH-SY5Y cells expressing Tau protein were cultured in DMEM containing 10 % FBS. 2.5 X 106 cells were placed in a 6-well plate and incubated at 5 % CO2 and 37 °C for 16 hrs. The compounds obtained in the above Examples serially diluted 1/3 from 3 µM to 0.5 nM or the compounds in a concentration of 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.003 µM were treated for 4 hrs in DMEM containing 5 % FBS. After 4 hrs, the culture solution was removed, washed with PBS, and cells were lysed by adding 100 µl of lysis buffer. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDT, 1 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM Na3VO4, 2.5 mM DTT, 1 % Triton X-100, and Protease inhibitor (Pierce). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 10 000 rpm and 4 °C for 10 min and the proteins in the supernatant were quantified. 25 µg of the proteins were electrophoresed on a SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF (Amersharm) membrane. The PVDF membrane was immersed in T-PBS containing 10 % skim milk and shaken for 1 hr at room temperature. The primary antibody, Phosph-Tau[pSer202] (Abcam), diluted 1:1500 in T-PBS solution containing 5 % skim milk was reacted with the membrane at room temperature for 2 hrs. The membrane was washed with T-PBS. The secondary antibody, Anti-rabbit IgG HRP, diluted 1:5000 was added to the membrane, reacted at room temperature for 1 hr, and washed.

Experimental Example 8 : Analysis for inhibition of APP phosphorylation and Aβ generation
The following experiment was conducted to confirm whether the compounds according to the present invention inhibit the phosphorylation of APP (amyloid precursor protein) to prevent Aβ (amyloid β protein) generation.
The APP gene was inserted into B103 cells so that APP could be stably expressed and the resulting B103/APP cells were used to confirm inhibition of APP phosphorylation and Aβ generation.
To confirm the effect of APP phosphorylation inhibition by the compounds obtained in the above Examples, 8 × 105 B103/APP cells were cultured in a 6-well plate for 16 hrs in DMEM containing 500 µg/ml of G418 and 5 % FBS.
