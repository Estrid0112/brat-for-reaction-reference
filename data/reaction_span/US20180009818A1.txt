CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS
The present application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-031919 filed on Feb. 23, 2016 and Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-140801 filed on Jul. 15, 2016, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The present invention relates to a novel fused pyrimidine compound having RET inhibitory activity or a salt thereof, and to a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound or salt.
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel fused pyrimidine compound having RET inhibitory activity or a salt thereof, and to a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound or salt.
BACKGROUND ART
Various protein kinases are present in vivo, and are known to be involved in a wide range of functional regulations. RET is a receptor tyrosine kinase identified as one of the proto-oncogenes. RET binds to the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and GDNF receptor to form a complex, which enables RET to perform physiological functions through intracellular phosphorylation signaling (Non-patent Literature 1). A study reports that in normal tissues, RET contributes to kidney development and neurogenesis during fetal life (Non-patent Literature 2). Some studies indicate that in cancers, such as lung cancer, thyroid cancer, breast cancer, pancreas cancer, and prostate cancer, the translocation, mutation, and overexpression of RET enhances its activation to thereby contribute to cell growth, tumor formation, or tissue infiltration (Non-patent Literature 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). In addition, RET is known to be a poor prognostic factor of cancer, as indicated in some reports that the translocation of RET and its enhanced activation level are also inversely correlated with prognosis in cancer (Non-patent Literature 9, 10, 11, and 12).
Therefore, an inhibitor capable of inhibiting RET activity is thought to be useful as a therapeutic agent for diseases associated with abnormally enhanced RET signaling pathways.
It is expected, for example, that in cancers involving translocated, mutated, and overexpressed RET, the administration of a medicament capable of specifically inhibiting RET will selectively and intensively suppress the proliferation of cancer cells and contribute to the treatment, life prolongation, and improvement in quality of life of cancer patients.
As such compounds having RET inhibitory activity, PP1 is known (Non-patent Literature 13). In PP1, a p-tolyl group is bonded to a fused ring pyrimidine skeleton. PP1 is known to exhibit high inhibitory activity against not only RET but also Src (Non-patent Literature 14), c-Kit, Bcr-Abl (Non-patent Literature 15 and 16), and others. For example, as side effects, the inhibition of Src may lead to abnormally enhanced bone formation, and the inhibition of Lck may suppress T cells (Non-patent Literature 17 and 18). Since multikinase inhibitors inhibit not only RET but also various signaling pathways to inhibit cell growth and other functions, the inhibitors raise concerns about possible various side effects, which may require dose reduction and/or drug holidays, thus leading to insufficient RET inhibitory activity. From the standpoint of side-effect reduction, RET inhibitors that have high inhibitory activity against RET with low inhibitory activity against other kinases have been desired.
Non-patent Literature 19 and Patent Literature 1 disclose a substance with a fused pyrimidine skeleton to which a ring structure is attached through an amide bond. This compound is described as having Aurora kinase inhibitory activity.
Patent Literature 2 discloses a pyrrolopyrimidine derivative that selectively inhibits Tie-2, TrkA, and its family member TrkB.
Patent Literature 3 discloses a pyrrolopyrimidine derivative that selectively inhibits Tie-2 and its family members.
Patent Literature 4 discloses a pyrrolopyrimidine derivative that is a potassium channel modulator.
Patent Literature 5 discloses a pyrrolopyrimidine derivative that has a therapeutic effect on diabetes.
Patent Literature 6 and 7 disclose a heterocyclic substituted cyclopentane compound that inhibits adenosine kinase.
Patent Literature 8 discloses a pyrrolopyrimidine derivative that has a vinyl group or an ethynyl group.
Patent Literature 9 discloses a fused pyrimidine derivative that has a BTK inhibitory activity.
However, none of Patent Literature above specifically discloses or even suggests an RET inhibitory compound with a fused pyrimidine skeleton that contains an amino group at the 4-position and a ring attached through an amide bond.

Moreover, the RET of the present invention may have translocations and mutations (including point mutations, deletion mutations, and insertion mutations), as long as it has RET kinase activity.
Translocations of RET in the present invention include a case where the whole or part of the RET protein having RET kinase activity is fused with the whole or part of another protein (e.g., KIF5B protein, CCDC6 protein, NCOA4 protein, or TRIM33 protein) to form a fused protein, and preferably CCDC6-RET and KIF5B-RET (CCDC6-RET means that part of the CCDC6 protein and part of the RET protein are fused in this order; hereinafter the same) (Drilon A, Cancer Discov., 3 (6), pp. 630-635 (2013)).
Mutations of RET in the present invention may be point mutations, deletion mutations, or insertion mutations, as long as the RET has RET kinase activity. Mutations of RET include polypeptides having RET kinase activity and comprising an amino acid sequence mutated by substitution, deletion, or addition of one or several amino acids, or by a combination thereof, in the amino acid sequence of RET, e.g., the amino acid sequence encoded by GenBank Accession number: NM_020975 or the amino acid sequence encoded by GenBank Accession number: NM_020630.
Regions to be mutated are not limited, as long as the RET has RET kinase activity. The ATP-binding region or the gatekeeper region may be mutated. The region of the residue adjacent to the hinge region to which ATP of protein kinase is bonded is called the gatekeeper region. The amino acid residue of this region greatly affects the spatial configuration of the ATP-binding pocket. The amino acid of the gatekeeper region in RET is 804th valine of the amino acid sequence encoded by GenBank accession number: NM_020975 or GenBank accession number: NM_020630. RET V804L mutation and RET V804M mutation have been clinically reported in thyroid cancer patients (Bolino A, Oncogene, 10, pp. 2415-2419, (1995), etc.).
It is also known that continuous administration of a protein kinase inhibitor often leads to spontaneous mutations in amino acid residues of the gatekeeper region (Kobayashi S, N Engl J Med., 352(8): pp. 786-792, (2005), etc.). Therefore, continuous administration of a RET inhibitor may lead to a mutation in the 804th valine in the gatekeeper region (Cranston A N, Cancer Res., 66 (20): pp. 10179-10187, (2006)). Mutations in the gatekeeper 5 region acquire inhibitor resistance, and can therefore cause serious therapeutic problems. Actually, basic research have reported that cells obtained by introducing V804L mutation or V804M mutation into RET show resistance to Vandetanib, which is a drug having RET inhibitory activity (Carlomagno F, Oncogene, 23, pp. 6056-6063, (2004)).
These resistant mutant RETs are preferably RETs having V804L, V804M, V804E, Y806C, Y806E, Y806S, Y806H, or Y806N in which the 804th valine, which is the gatekeeper region, or its neighboring the 806th tyrosine, is substituted with another amino acid; and more preferably RET having V804L or V804M in which the 804th valine is substituted with leucine or methionine.
Moreover, the RET of the present invention may have mutations in regions other than the gatekeeper region, as long as it has RET kinase activity. Examples include, but are not limited to, RET having C618S, C620R, C630R, C634R, C634W, C634Y, C691S, E768D, A883F, A883S, E884V, S891A, S891L, or M918T (for example, C618S represents RET in which the 618th cysteine is substituted with serine; hereinafter the same) in the amino acid sequence encoded by GenBank accession number: NM_020975 or GenBank accession number: NM_020630. Preferred is C634W.
The presence of mutations of RET can be examined by analyzing the gene sequence of RET or the sequence of mRNA, which is a RET gene transcript. Examples of the sequence analysis method include the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (Sanger et al. (1977) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 74:5463) and the like. The sequence can also be analyzed by using a suitable DNA sequencer.
The presence of mutations of RET can also be analyzed by, for example, in situ hybridization, northern blot analysis, DNA microarray, RT-PCR, SSCP-PCR (Single-Strand Conformation Polymorphism-PCR), or the like. These methods can be performed in a standard manner (Clinical Cancer Research, 8, 457-463, 2002).
Further, the presence of mutations of RET can be analyzed by, for example, an immunochemical method (e.g., immunohistochemical technique, immunoprecipitation method, western blotting, flow cytometry, ELISA, RIA, or the like). These methods can be performed in a standard manner.
In order to analyze the presence of RET mutations by PCR, the sequence of the primer can be designed in a standard manner. The sequence of the primer can be designed by using, for example, Primer Expression (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems).
Due to their excellent RET inhibitory activity, the compounds or salts thereof of the present invention are useful as pharmaceutical preparations for preventing and treating RET-related diseases. Examples of the “RET-related diseases” include diseases whose incidence can be reduced, and whose symptoms can be remitted, relieved, and/or completely cured by eliminating, suppressing, and/or inhibiting RET function. Examples of such diseases include, but are not limited to, malignant tumors, etc. Preferred examples of malignant tumors include malignant tumors with enhanced activation of RET, more preferably non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, or thyroid cancer with overactivated RET.
The phrase “enhanced activation of RET” indicates that the activated state of RET is enhanced due to, for example, translocations and mutations (including point mutations, deletion mutations, and insertion mutations) of the RET gene, and overexpression (including an increased copy numbers of the RET gene, overexpression of messenger RNA of RET, increased RET proteins, and constitutively activated RET proteins).
The type of cancer and tumor to be treated by the compounds or salts thereof of the present invention is not particularly limited. Examples include epithelial cancers (respiratory organ cancers, digestive organ cancers, reproductive organ cancers, secretion organ cancers, etc.), sarcomas, hematopoietic tumors, central nervous system tumors, and peripheral nerve tumors.

Examples of the dosage form include oral preparations, injections, suppositories, ointments, patches, and the like; preferably oral preparations. Such dosage forms can be formed by methods conventionally known to persons skilled in the art.
As the pharmaceutical carrier, various conventional organic or inorganic carrier materials used as preparation materials may be blended as an excipient, binder, disintegrant, lubricant, or coating agent in solid preparations; or as a solvent, solubilizing agent, suspending agent, isotonizing agent, pH adjuster/buffer, or soothing agent in liquid preparations. Moreover, pharmaceutical preparation additives, such as antiseptics, antioxidants, colorants, sweeteners, and stabilizers, may also be used, if required.
When a solid preparation for oral administration is prepared, optionally an excipient, a binder, a disintegrator, a lubricant, a colorant, a sweetener, and the like may be added to the compound of the present invention; and the resulting mixture may be formulated into tablets, coated tablets, granules, powders, capsules, etc., according to an ordinary method.
When an injection is prepared, a pH adjuster, a buffer, a stabilizer, an isotonizing agent, a local anesthetic, and the like may be added, as necessary, to the compound of the present invention; and the resulting mixture may be formulated into subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous injections according to an ordinary method.
The amount of the compound of the present invention to be incorporated in each of such dosage unit forms depends on the condition of the patient to whom the compound is administered, the dosage form, etc. In general, in the case of an oral agent, an injection, and a suppository, the amount of the compound of the present invention is preferably 0.05 to 1000 mg, 0.01 to 500 mg, and 1 to 1000 mg, respectively, per dosage unit form.
The daily dose of the medicine in such a dosage form depends on the condition, body weight, age, gender, etc., of the patient, and cannot be generalized. For example, the daily dose of the compound of the present invention for an adult (body weight: 50 kg) may be generally 0.05 to 5000 mg, and preferably 0.1 to 1000 mg; and is preferably administered in one dose, or in two to three divided doses, per day.
The compounds or salts thereof of the present invention have excellent RET inhibitory activity, and are useful as antitumor agents.

Test Example 1: Measurement of Inhibitory Activity Against RET (In Vitro)
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against RET kinase activity, the website of AnaSpec states that Srctide (GEEPLYWSFPAKKK) corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure RET kinase activity. Thus, the amino acid sequence was partly modified and biotinylated to prepare biotinylated peptides (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK). The purified recombinant human RET protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the compounds of the present invention were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, RET protein, the substrate peptide (the final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 10 μM), and a solution of the compound of the present invention in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 2.5%) were added to a buffer for kinase reaction (13.5 mM Tris, pH of 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.009% Tween-20). Each of the mixtures was incubated at 25° C. for 100 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 24 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under the excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
Tables 35 and 36 show IC50 (nM) of the RET inhibitory activity of Vandetanib, the compounds of the Examples, and compounds 2 to 5 of the Comparative Examples.
Vandetanib is known to have a high inhibitory activity against RET (Carlomagno F. Cancer Res. 2002 Dec. 15; 62(24): 7284-90). The compounds of the present invention or salts thereof represented by the compounds of the Examples were found to exhibit in vitro RET inhibitory activity at a level equivalent to or higher than that of Vandetanib. In contrast, compounds 2 to 5 of the Comparative Examples exhibited a significantly lower inhibitory activity against RET.

Test Example 2: Selectivity for RET Over Other Kinases (In Vitro)
Since multikinase inhibitors inhibit not only RET but also various signaling pathways to suppress cell growth and other functions, the inhibitors raise concerns about possible various side effects, which may require dose reduction or drug holidays, leading to insufficient RET inhibitory activity. The following discusses selectivity for RET over other kinases of the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof.
1) RET Inhibitory Activity Measurement
Inhibitory activity against RET was measured in the same manner as in Test Example 1.
2) SRC Inhibitory Activity Measurement
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against SRC kinase activity, the price list of LabChip-series consumable reagents of PerkinElmer shows that FL-Peptide 4 corresponds to the substrate peptide for measurement of SRC kinase activity. Thus, FL-Peptide 4 was used as a substrate. The purified recombinant human SRC protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the test compounds were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, SRC protein, FL-Peptide 4 (the final concentration: 1.5 μM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 15 μM), and a solution of a test compound in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a reaction buffer (100 mM HEPES, pH of 7.0, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.003% Brij35, 0.04% Tween-20) containing a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (PhosSTOP, Roche) and a protease inhibitor cocktail (cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free, Roche) at recommended concentrations. Each mixture was incubated at 30° C. for 90 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. EDTA diluted with a separation buffer available from PerkinElmer (the final concentration: 30 mM) was then added thereto to terminate the kinase reaction. Finally, non-phosphorylated substrate peptides (S) and phosphorylated peptides (P) were separated and detected by microchannel capillary electrophoresis using a LabChip EZ Reader II (PerkinElmer). The phosphorylation level was calculated from the height of the peaks of S and P, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the ICso value (nM).
3) LCK Inhibitory Activity Measurement
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against LCK kinase activity, the website of AnaSpec states that Srctide (GEEPLYWSFPAKKK) corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure LCK kinase activity. Thus, the amino acid sequence was partly modified and biotinylated to prepare biotinylated peptides (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK). The purified recombinant human LCK protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the test compounds were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, LCK protein, the substrate peptides (the final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 50 μM), and a solution of a test compound in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a buffer for kinase reaction (13.5 mM Tris, pH of 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.009% Tween-20). Each mixture was incubated at 25° C. for 60 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 40 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
4) AURB (Aurora B) Inhibitory Activity Measurement
The in vitro inhibitory activity of the compounds against AURB kinase was measured with reference to the procedure described in JP2008-81492A. The purified recombinant human AURB protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the test compounds were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, AURB protein, FL-Peptide 21 (caliper Life Sciences, the final concentration: 100 nM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 1 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 40 μM), and a solution of a test compound in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a buffer solution for kinase reaction (20 mM HEPES, pH of 7.4, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.01% Tween-20), and each mixture was incubated at 25° C. for 60 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. An IMAP Progressive Binding Reagent diluted with IMAP Progressive Binding Buffer A (1:500 dilution, Molecular Devices, LLC.) was added thereto to terminate the kinase reaction. The reaction solution was allowed to stand in a dark place at room temperature for 120 minutes, and the phosphorylation level was calculated from the fluorescence polarization degree measured with PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH, the excitation wavelength: 485 nm, the detection wavelength: 520 nm). The compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
5) Measurement of Inhibitory Activity Against EGFR
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against EGFR kinase activity, the price list of LabChip (trademark) series consumable reagents of PerkinElmer shows that FL-Peptide 22 corresponds to the substrate peptide for measurement of EGFR kinase activity. Thus, with reference to the amino acid sequence, a biotinylated peptide (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK) was prepared. The purified recombinant human EGFR protein used in the test was purchased from Carna Biosciences, Inc.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the test compounds were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, EGFR protein, the substrate peptide (the final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), manganese chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 1.5 μM), and a solution of a test compound in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 2.5%) were added to a buffer solution for kinase reaction (Carna Biosciences, Inc.). Each mixture was incubated at 25° C. for 120 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 24 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
6) Selectivity for RET Inhibition
From the values obtained in sections 1) to 5) above, SRC inhibitory activity IC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM), LCK inhibitory activity IC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM), AURB inhibitory activity IC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM), and EGFR inhibitory activity IC50 (nM)/RET inhibitory activity IC50 (nM) were calculated, and the selectivity for RET inhibition of the test compounds was examined.
Tables 37 to 44 show the results. Tables 37 to 44 reveal that the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof represented by the compounds of the Examples exhibited higher selectivity for RET inhibition over SRC, LCK, Aurora B, and EGFR, as compared with compound 1 of the Comparative Examples. The compounds of the present invention or salts thereof also exhibited excellent selectivity for RET inhibition over other kinases (PI3K, TrkB). Thus, the results suggest that the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof have a low potential for causing side effects attributed to inhibition of kinases other than RET.

Test Example 3: Inhibitory Activity Against Resistance Mutation of RET (In Vitro)
1) Measurement of Inhibitory Activity Against RET (V804L)
Regarding the conditions for measurement of in vitro inhibitory activity of compounds against RET (V804L) (i.e., RET with V804L mutation) kinase activity, the website of AnaSpec states that Srctide (GEEPLYWSFPAKKK) corresponds to the substrate peptide for reaction to measure RET kinase activity. Thus, the amino acid sequence was partly modified and biotinylated to prepare biotinylated peptides (biotin-EEPLYWSFPAKKK). The purified recombinant human RET (V804L) protein used in the test was purchased from Eurofins.
To measure the inhibitory activity, first, the test compounds were individually diluted with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) stepwise. Subsequently, RET (V804L) protein, the substrate peptides (the final concentration: 250 nM), magnesium chloride (the final concentration: 10 mM), ATP (the final concentration: 10 μM), and a solution of a test compound in DMSO (the final concentration of DMSO: 5%) were added to a buffer for kinase reaction (13.5 mM Tris, pH of 7.5, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.009% Tween-20). Each of the mixtures was incubated at 25° C. for 120 minutes to perform a kinase reaction. EDTA was then added thereto to give a final concentration of 40 mM so that the reaction was terminated. A detection solution containing Eu-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody PT66 (PerkinElmer) and SureLight APC-SA (PerkinElmer) was added thereto, and each mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours or more. Finally, the intensity of fluorescence under excitation light with a wavelength of 337 nm was measured with a PHERAstar FS (BMG Labtech) at the two wavelengths of 620 nm and 665 nm. The phosphorylation level was calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at the two wavelengths, and the compound concentration at which phosphorylation was inhibited by 50% was defined as the IC50 value (nM).
2) Measurement of Inhibitory Activity Against RET (V804M)
RET (V804M) (i.e., RET with V804M mutation) kinase activity was measured using purified recombinant human RET (V804M) protein purchased from Eurofins with the final concentration of ATP being 13 μM in the kinase reaction system, following procedure 1) for the other part.
Tables 45 to 48 show the IC50 (nM) of the inhibitory activity against RET with resistance mutantation of the compounds of the Examples, Vandetanib, and compounds 1 to 4 of the Comparative Examples.
Vandetanib is known to have a high inhibitory activity against RET (Carlomagno F. Cancer Res. 2002 Dec. 15; 62(24): 7284-90). However, Vandetanib exhibited a significantly low inhibitory activity against RET (V804L) and RET (V804M).
Compounds 1 to 4 of the Comparative Examples also exhibited a significantly low inhibitory activity against RET (V804L) and RET (V804M).
Alectinib is reported to exhibit an inhibitory effect on RET (V804L), and has an IC50 (nM) of 32 in vitro (Mol Cancer Ther. 2014 December; 13 (12): 2910-8). The compounds of the present invention or salts thereof represented by the compounds of the Examples exhibited an excellent inhibitory activity against RET (V804L) at a level equivalent to or higher than that of Alectinib. The compounds of the present invention or salts thereof represented by the compounds of the Examples also exhibited a high inhibitory activity against RET (V804M). The results suggest that the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof have an antitumor effect on cancers and tumors expressing RET with mutation in its gatekeeper site (e.g., V804L and V804M).

Solutions of the test compounds in DMSO/acetonitrile (the final concentration of each test compound was 1 μM, the final concentration of DMSO was 0.01%, and the final concentration of acetonitrile was 1%) were individually added to a liver microsome mixture solution (mouse liver microsome with a final concentration of 0.25 mg/mL, a potassium phosphate buffer with a final concentration of 100 mM, and magnesium chloride with a final concentration of 3 mM), and each mixture was pre-incubated at 37° C. for 5 minutes. A NADPH-generating system (glucose-6-phosphate with a final concentration of 10 mM, oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate with a final concentration of 1 mM, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase with a final concentration of 1 unit/mL) was added to a portion of each mixture solution, and a metabolic reaction was started. After incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes, a double amount of ethanol was added thereto to terminate the reaction, thereby obtaining post-reaction samples. A double amount of ethanol was added to each of the remaining mixture solutions, and a NADPH-generating system was further added thereto, thereby obtaining pre-reaction samples. The pre-reaction samples and post-reaction samples were centrifuged at 2000×g, and their supernatant was filtered through a glass filter. Each filtrate was then introduced into LC-MS/MS, and MS/MS peaks of the test compounds were detected. From the ratio of the post-reaction MS/MS peak to the pre-reaction MS/MS peak of the test compounds, the percentage of the remaining test compounds (remaining %) was calculated.
Table 49 shows the results. Whereas compounds 1 and 2 of the Comparative Examples had a remaining percentage of 0% in either case, the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof represented by the compounds of the Examples had a high remaining percentage. This indicates that the compounds of the present invention or salts thereof are significantly more stable in mouse liver microsome than the compounds of the Comparative Examples.

Test Example 6: Evaluation of Cell Growth Inhibitory Effect (1)
An in vitro cytotoxicity test was performed on TT cells (a human thyroid cancer cell line with RET activating mutation (C634W)).
A TT cell suspension prepared with Ham's F12K (kaighn's) medium (Life Technologies Japan) containing 10% FBS was inoculated into each well of a 96-well flat-bottomed microplate in an amount of 5×103 cells/well (0.15 mL), and cultured in an incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. overnight (day 0). The compounds of the present invention were individually dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to give a concentration of 10 mM, and further diluted with a 10% FBS-containing RPMI1640 medium (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) so that the compounds of the present invention respectively had a final concentration of 40, 12, 4, 1.2, 0.4, 0.12, 0.04, and 0.012 μM. The compounds of different concentrations were individually added to wells of the TT cell-containing culture plate described above in an amount of 0.05 mL/well (day 1), and cultured in an incubator containing 5% carbon dioxide at 37° C. for 7 days. After culture (day 8), 0.1 mL of the medium was removed from each well, and 0.1 mL of a CellTiter Glo 2.0 reagent (Promega Corporation), which is an intracellular ATP luminescence detection reagent, was added thereto, followed by shaking for 1 minute. After shaking, each culture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes, and the chemiluminescence was measured with a luminometer to use it as an index of the number of viable cells.

Test Example 10: Evaluation of In Vivo Antitumor Effect Using Mice Model Subcutaneously Implanted TT Cells (Human Thyroid Cancer Cell Line with RET Activating Mutation)
Human thyroid cancer cell lines (TT) were subcutaneously implanted into the right frank of 6- to 7-week-old BALB/cA Jcl-nu/nu male mice. After about 2 to 3 weeks from the cell implantation, the length (nm) and the width (mm) of tumors found in mouse bodies were measured. After their tumor volume (tumor volume: TV) was calculated, the mice were divided into groups (n=5 or 6) so that the groups had a substantially equal mean TV. The day on which the mice were divided into groups was determined to be the “grouping day” (day 0 or 1).
Test solutions containing the compounds of the present invention were prepared at a dose of 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg/day, and orally administered to the mice for consecutive 14 days (the first administration day is day 1). A control group was administered a solvent (0.5% HPMC/0.1N HCl).
To determine the index of the antitumor effect, TV of each drug-administrated group was measured on day 15, and the tumor volume on day 15 relative to the tumor volume on the grouping day (day 0 or 1) (relative tumor volume: RTV) and T/C (%) were calculated from the following equations, and the antitumor effect was evaluated. When a group administered any of the compounds of the present invention (test compound treatment group) exhibited a statistically significantly smaller mean RTV (Dunnett's test, p<0.05) than the mean RTV of the control group, an antitumor effect was determined to be present. FIGS. 1 and 2 and Tables 54 and 55 show the results. In the figures, the symbol “*” indicates a statistically significant difference.
<in-line-formulae>TV (mm3)=(length×width2)/2</in-line-formulae>
<in-line-formulae>RTV=(TV on day 15)/(TV on day 0 or day 1)</in-line-formulae>
<in-line-formulae>T/C(%)=(the mean RTV of a test compound treatment group)/(the mean RTV of the control group)×100</in-line-formulae>
To determine the index of the toxicity, the body weight (body weight: BW (g)) of the mice was measured over time, and the mean body weight change (body weight change: BWC (%)) from the grouping day (day 0 or day 1) to day 15 was calculated from the following equation (n: the day on which the body weight was measured at 2 times/week, and the final measurement day was day 15 on which the final evaluation was performed). FIGS. 3 and 4 show the results.
<in-line-formulae>BWC (%)=[(BW on day n)−(BW on day 0 or day 1)]/(BW on day 0 or day 1)×100</in-line-formulae>
The compounds of the present invention exhibited a remarkable antitumor effect on the human thyroid cancer line TT with RET-activating mutation, which was subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. Toxicity, such as weight loss, was not observed.
