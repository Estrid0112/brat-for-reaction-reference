Technical Field
The present invention belongs to the field of medicinal chemistry, and specifically relates to a novel tenofovir monobenzyl ester phosphamide compound, or the hydrate, solvate, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or single chiral isomer thereof, as well as the preparation method thereof and use thereof in the medicine.
Background Art
Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF) is a water soluble anti-HIV and anti-HBV oral drug, stable in the stomach, enters the body with the blood after the intestinal absorption, and uniformly distributed within human tissues; less than 20% is metabolized and activated into the Tenofovir parent drug under the action of esterase, and then diphosphorylated into Tenofovir diphosphate to take effect, and about the remaining 80% is excreted out of the body in original form. To improve the bio-availability, currently, the strategy of introducing the masking group onto the phosphate group of the Tenofovir to form the lipid soluble pro-drug is usually adopted. Structurally, one masking group is linked with the phosphate group to form a phosphoramide structure, another group linked with the phosphate group to form a phospholipid structure. The compound with this structure is proven to have the lymph and liver tissue targeting effect. Ester-forming groups include various aromatic rings and heteroaromatic rings, especially the substituted or unsubstituted phenyl (CN201310041647.4, WO02082841). The patent (CN01813161) disclosed a compound GS-7340 obtained by using such pro-drug strategy, which enhanced the liver-targeting properties compared with Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate (TDF), while the efficacy enhanced and the toxicity reduced. However, due to the unstability of the phenol group acting as the masking group, metabolism may still occur in the blood to produce the active parent drug Tenofovir, and therefore brings certain systemic toxicity. The phenol produced by the metabolism also has relatively high toxicity itself. The benzyl type Tenofovir pro-drug compound with substitution(s) on the benzene ring has been proven to have liver-targeting activities. Patents US20130210757 and CN201380030061.6 disclosed that one masking group was phosphoramide formed by the amino acid ester and the phosphate group; another masking group was benzyl ester with substitution(s) on the benzene ring formed by benzyl with the electron-donating groups such as methyl on the benzene ring at the ortho or para position, and the phosphate group. However, there's no report of the synthesis and bio-activity researches for the Tenofovir pro-drug compound by using the unsubstituted benzyl as an ester-forming group, in part because the benzyl group without substitution(s) on the benzene ring can not be metabolized during the use of the 5-fluorouracil nucleotide pro-drug, causing it to be not active (WO02082841).
The masking group of o-methyl benzyl of the compound structure disclosed in CN201380030061.6  has a high group-leaving activity and low stability during the blood esterase metabolism, the targeting group is relatively easier to be detached, therefore leading to the relative increase of the active parent drug in the blood and relative decrease of the active parent drug in the liver, and affecting the activity and systemic toxicity.
To enhance the bio-activity of Tenofovir and upgrade its anti-virus activity, the present invention provides a class of tenofovir monobenzyl ester phosphamide compounds without substitution(s) on the benzene ring of the benzyl group, and the preparation method thereof, as well as their use in the lymph-targeting anti-AIDS infection and the liver-targeting anti-hepatitis B treatment; compared with GS-7340 and compound 7, such pro-drugs are more stable against esterase, and further enhance the systemic stability and liver-targeting anti-virus effect of the Tenofovir analogues.
Summary of the Invention
The inventors of the present invention invented a class of tenofovir monobenzyl ester phosphamide compounds, and accidentally found that the compounds of the present invention can be metabolized into the active parent drug of Tenofovir (TFV) in the cell test, and therefore have anti-virus activities. In the in vivo animal test, after gastric gavage to the mice, the compounds can be enriched in the liver, where they are metabolized into the active product of Tenofovir. Compared with the prior art, the compounds of the present invention have a higher anti-HBV activity, or are more stable in the plasma, their metabolic segments are safer, and therefore the systemic toxic and side effects caused by the plasma metabolism are reduced.
In particular, the present invention provides a tenofovir monobenzyl ester phosphamide compound of the general formula X, and the hydrate, solvate, pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or the resolved single isomer thereof.wherein Z is selected from O, S, Se, NH- or CH2-,R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are each independently selected from H, substituted or unsubstituted C1-C10 linear alkyl, C3-C10 branched alkyl, C3-C10 cycloalkyl, and C6-C10 aryl or heteroaryl, wherein the substitution is one to three hetero atoms independently selected from O, S, N and Se, or a substituted or unsubstituted 3-8 membered ring formed by R1 and R2, R1 and R3, or R2 and R3 with the moiety they are attached to.

We found that the stereochemistry of the pro-drug can affect its metabolic ability and anti-virus activity in the targeting tissues, and the chiral moiety is on the phosphorus atom, and is also found to be on its masking group of amino acid. For example, amino acids with natural configurations have better metabolic activities, and the S isomer of compound 3 with the configuration of the P atom has a higher activity. If the chiral sites are not pure, these diastereomers or racemates need be chirally enriched so that the screened result makes more sense. The isomer with a single configuration at the chiral center described above is obtained through purification by chiral resolution so that each test compound is essentially a compound with the single chirality. Formation of the essentially single compound or chiral enrichment means that the stereoisomer in need accounts for more than about 60%, usually more than 80%, and preferably more than 95% of the compound by weight.

The most crucial profile of a prodrug is that it is apt to metabolite to the active parent drug meanwhile maintain unattached in other systems, that is, the more stable in systems (gastrointestinal tract, blood, etc.), and more active in the target organs (lymph, liver), then it will be more effective and less toxic as a drug candidate. In the test examples, all the prodrugs, including compounds in the present invention and in the reference, will play their anti-virus effect after being metabolized into Tenofovir (TFV), the active parent drug.
Currently, compounds with similar structures are the compounds listed in the claims of patent CN201380030061.6 (abbreviation: compound 7 and its single chiral isomer 7a and 7b thereof), and the drug TAF (GS-7340) for treating hepatitis B, that approved by FDA and launched by Gilead very recently. These compounds share the same parent drug motif as the compounds of the present invention, but the liver-targeting segments are different.
Compounds of the present invention are either more efficient or less toxic due to the higher stability of the structures. Moreover, the metabolites of the compounds of the present invention, benzoic acids, are much safer than their counterpart of GS-7340, the toxic phenol, and bring the advantage of being less toxic while having the superior activity. Furthermore, compared with the compounds in the claims of CN201380030061.6, because the liver-targeting group of the compounds of the present invention is benzyl, which is more stable than o-methyl benzyl, and the activity of benzyl to be detached during the esterase metabolism in blood is comparatively low, the active parent drug in the blood is relatively reduced, the active parent drug in the liver is relatively increased, and therefore exhibit the better activity. The toxicity is lower after benzyl is detached from the compound of the present invention, leading to better systemic stability and lower toxicity. They are specifically present as follow:

The test data of the preliminary stability study showed that, for compounds 3a and 3b, GS-7340 and 7b, the stabilities in the human liver S9 were comparative, also the rates of metabolizing to the active parent drug were comparative, implying that the activities of the compounds of the same concentration in the liver cells were comparative.
In the simulated gastric fluid, the stabilities of 3a and 3b were comparative to GS-7340 but higher than 7b; the stabilities of 3a and 3b in the simulated intestinal fluid were significantly higher than those of 7b and GS-7340. The stabilities of 3a and 3b in the human blood were also better than those of the comparative compounds 7b and GS-7340. Generally, compounds 3a and 3b had higher stabilities in the gastrointestinal tract and blood system compared to GS-7340 and 7b, so that the drug concentration would be lower in the non-target system while higher in the target tissues, implying that compounds 3a and 3b would have better liver-targeting properties and lower systemic toxicities compared to GS-7340 and 7b.

The results showed that after 3 h, the concentrations of compound 3 and its metabolic product of Tenofovir TFV in the liver were both higher than those in the blood, and the overall concentration of both in the liver is 377 times of that in the blood, demonstrating that compound 3 could be effectively enriched in the liver. Meanwhile, the concentration of TFV in the blood was only 0.72 times of that of the parent drug compound 3, while the concentration of the parent drug TFV in the liver was 166 times of that of the prodrug compound 3, demonstrating that compound 3 was relatively stable in the mouse blood, and effectively metabolized into the active parent drug Tenofovir in the liver.
Therefore, compound 3 had blood stability and liver-targeting anti-HBV activity in the animal test in vivo.
