TECHNICAL FIELD
This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2015-0129920 and 10-2016-0104935 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Sep. 14, 2015 and Aug. 18, 2016, respectively, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
The present specification relates to a hetero-cyclic compound and an organic light emitting device including the same.
BACKGROUND ART
In general, an organic light emitting phenomenon refers to a phenomenon in which electric energy is converted into light energy by using an organic material. An organic light emitting device using the organic light emitting phenomenon usually has a structure including a positive electrode, a negative electrode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. Here, the organic material layer may have a multi-layered structure composed of different materials in order to improve the efficiency and stability of an organic light emitting device in many cases, and for example, may be composed of a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transport layer, an electron injection layer, and the like. In the structure of the organic light emitting device, if a voltage is applied between two electrodes, holes are injected from a positive electrode into the organic material layer and electrons are injected from a negative electrode into the organic material layer, and when the injected holes and electrons meet each other, an exciton is formed, and light is emitted when the exciton falls down again to a ground state.
There is a continuous need for developing a new material for the aforementioned organic light emitting device.

When the organic light emitting device includes a plurality of organic material layers, the organic material layers may be formed of the same material or different materials.
For example, the organic light emitting device of the present specification may be manufactured by sequentially stacking a first electrode, an organic material layer, and a second electrode on a substrate. In this case, the organic light emitting device may be manufactured by depositing a metal or a metal oxide having conductivity, or an alloy thereof on a substrate to form a first electrode, forming an organic material layer including a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light emitting layer, and an electron transport layer thereon, and then depositing a material, which may be used as a second electrode, thereon, by using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method such as sputtering or e-beam evaporation. In addition to the method as described above, an organic light emitting device may be made by sequentially depositing a negative electrode material, an organic material layer, and a first electrode material on a substrate. Further, the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 may be formed as an organic material layer by not only a vacuum deposition method, but also a solution application method when an organic light emitting device is manufactured.

The substrate was mounted on a vacuum chamber, and then the base pressure was allowed to be 1×10−6 torr, and then for the organic material, DNTPD (700 Å), a-NPB (300 Å), and Compound 29 were used as hosts (90 wt %) on the ITO, the following (piq)2Ir(acac) (10 wt %) was co-deposited as a dopant, films were formed in the order of Alq3 (350 Å), LiF (5 Å), and Al (1,000 Å), and measurements were made at 0.4 mA.
The structures of DNTPD, α-NPB, (piq)2Ir(acac), and Alq3 are as follows.

For the organic light emitting devices manufactured according to Experimental Examples 4-1 to 4-6 and Comparative Example 4-1, the voltages, current densities, luminances, color coordinates, and lifetimes were measured, and the results are shown in the following Table 4. T95 means the time taken for the luminance to be reduced to 95% of the initial luminance (5,000 nit).
