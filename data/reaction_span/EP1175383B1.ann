T1	REACTION_SPAN 108131 108217;108218 109246	Preparation 2 1(R)-Benzyl-6-methoxy-1(S)-(3-oxo-butyl)-3,4-dihydro-1H-naphthelen-2-one A solution of 62 g (0.23 mol) of the title product of Preparation 1 and 28 mL, (0.23 mol) of freshly distilled (S)-(-)-alpha-methyl benzylamine in 100 mL of toluene was heated to reflux, over a Dean-Stark trap, overnight. After removal of the azeotroped water, the imine solution was cooled to 0 째C and 21 mL (0.26 mol) of freshly distilled methylvinylketone was added dropwise to the solution. The solution was stirred at 0 째C for 30 min then heated to 40 째C overnight. The reaction solution was cooled to 0째 C and 17 mL of acetic acid and 14 mL of H2O were added and the resultant solution was allow to warm to RT for 2 h. The solution was poured into H2O and extracted three times with EtOAc. The combined organic layers were washed with 1 N HCl, H2O, saturated NaHCO3, then dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated to dryness. The crude product was purified by chromatography over SiO2 using 15% EtOAc to 35% EtOAc in hexanes as the gradient eluant to give 48 g of the title product of this preparation as a yellow solid.

Starting with 4.64 g 1-benzyl-6-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-naphthalen-2-one produced 3.58 g of the title product of this preparation as a yellow solid.
