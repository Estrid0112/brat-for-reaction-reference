TECHNICAL FIELD
This disclosure relates to a cyclic amine derivative and pharmaceutical use thereof.
BACKGROUND
Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage. Pain is classified according to cause into nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain and psychogenic pain.
Neuropathic pain is pathological pain caused by peripheral or central nervous system dysfunction, more specifically, pain caused by e.g., direct damage and oppression of the nerve tissue despite of no nociceptive stimulus to a nociceptor. As the therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, an anxiolytic drug or an antiepileptic drug (gabapentin, pregabalin or the like) is used.
In the meantime, compounds having the structure of a derivative analogous to our compounds as a partial structure are known in Japanese Patent No. 4563675. The possibility that the compounds may have drug efficacy to excessive overweight or obesity is suggested. International Publication WO 2006/137465 discloses that some nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivatives exert an antagonistic action specific to one of NMDA receptors, i.e., NR1/NR2B receptor. International Publication WO 2013/147160 discloses that imidazole derivatives exert an analgesic action.
However, therapy with a conventional therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain is highly frequently associated with central nervous system adverse effects (e.g., dizziness, nausea or vomiting). Since it is difficult to administer such a therapeutic agent for a long term, development of a novel therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain has been desired.
Whether or not the substituted piperidines described in JP '675 have analgesic action including action against neuropathic pain is not known. Usefulness of the substituted piperidines described in JP '675 as a lead compound for an analgesic agent, particularly a therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain, has not yet been reported. It has been suggested that the nitrogen-containing heterocyclic derivatives described in WO '465 may have usefulness as an analgesic agent. It is disclosed that the imidazole derivatives described in WO '160 have an analgesic action.
It could therefore be helpful to provide a compound having a strong analgesic action for pain, in particular, neuropathic pain.

We thus provide a cyclic amine derivative having a strong analgesic effect against pain, in particular, neuropathic pain.
More specifically, we provide a cyclic amine derivative represented by general formula (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof.

The dose per day of a medicine containing a cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient varies depending upon e.g., the state or body weight of the patient or the type or administration route of a compound. For example, in the case of oral administration to an adult (weight: about 60 kg), the amount of the cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof serving as an active ingredient falls within the range of 1 to 1000 mg and administration is preferably made in 1 to 3 divided doses. In the case of parenteral administration to an adult (weight: about 60 kg) by an injectable solution, the amount of the cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof serving as an active ingredient in e.g., an injection, falls within the range of 0.01 to 100 mg per body weight (1 kg). The injectable solution is preferably intravenously administered.
A cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof may be used in combination with other medicinal agents in an appropriate blending ratio to supplement or enhance a therapeutic or prophylactic effect or reduce the dose. In this case, as the other medicinal agents, for example, an antidepressant such as amitriptyline, milnacipran or duloxetine; an anxiolytic such as alprazolam; an anticonvulsant such as carbamazepine; a local anesthetic such as lidocaine; a sympathetic agonist such as adrenaline; an NMDA receptor antagonist such as ketamine; a GABA transaminase inhibitor such as sodium valproate; a calcium channel blocker such as pregabalin; a serotonin receptor antagonist such as risperidone; a GABA receptor function enhancer such as diazepam; or an anti-inflammatory drug such as diclofenac can be mentioned.

Effect on Mouse Partial Sciatic Nerve Ligation Model
Using a partial sciatic nerve ligation model (Seltzer model) in mice by which neuropathic pain can be evaluated, the analgesic action of a cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof was investigated.
1. Experimental Method
The mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model was prepared in accordance with the method of Seltzer et al. (Malmberg et al., Pain, vol. 76, p. 215-222, 1998).
Slc: ICR mice (5 weeks old, male; from Japan SLC, Inc.) was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (70 mg/kg, intraperitoneal administration). The sciatic nerve at the femoral region of the right hind paw of each mouse was exposed and triply ligated tightly with silk suture of 8-0 (from NATSUME SEISAKUSHO CO., LTD.) under a stereomicroscope so that only half thickness of the nerve was trapped in the ligature. A group of mice thus treated was designated as a partial sciatic nerve ligation group. A group of mice whose sciatic nerve was just exposed and not ligated was designated as a sham surgery group.
Evaluation of neuropathic pain (hereinafter referred to as von Frey test) was performed as follows. Mice were conditioned for at least one hour in an acrylic cage for measurement (from NATSUME SEISAKUSHO CO. LTD.) placed on a wire net. Thereafter, using a filament (from North Coast Medical) which exerted a pressure of 0.16 g, the mice were subjected to mechanical tactile stimulus by applying the filament to the plantar surface of the right hind paw 3 times, each for 3 seconds, with an interval of 3 seconds. The withdrawal response observed during each mechanical tactile stimulus was scored (0, no response; 1, showed slow and/or slight withdrawal response in response to the stimulation; 2, showed quick withdrawal response without flinching (shaking paws quickly and continuously) nor licking (licking paws) in response to the stimulation; 3, showed quick withdrawal response with flinching and/or licking), and the sum of the scores obtained in the triplicate trials (hereinafter referred to as the total score) were used as a pain index.
Seven days after the sciatic nerve ligation surgery, the compounds of Examples 13 to 24 (0.3 to 10 mg/kg for the compounds of Examples 13 to 15 and 22 to 24 and 10 mg/kg for the compounds of Examples 16 to 21) or pregabalin as a positive control (10 mg/kg; Bosche Scientific) was dissolved in distilled water and orally administered to mice of the partial sciatic nerve ligation group. The partial sciatic nerve ligation mouse groups to which the compounds of Examples 13 to 24 were separately administered, were designated as a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 13” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 14” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 15” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 16” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 17” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 18” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 19” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 20” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 21” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 22” group; a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 23” group; and a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 24” group, respectively. The partial sciatic nerve ligation mouse group to which pregabalin was administered, was designated as a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+pregabalin” group. A group wherein distilled water was orally administered to the mice of the partial sciatic nerve ligation group was designated as a “partial sciatic nerve ligation+distilled water” group. A group wherein distilled water was orally administered to the mice of the sham surgery group was designated as a “sham surgery +distilled water” group.
The von Frey test was carried out before oral administration of a test compound (pre-value), one hour, two hours, and three hours after the oral administration of a test compound.
2. Results
The results are shown in FIGS. 1 to 12. In the figures, the vertical axis represents the total score (mean value±standard error; n=4 to 6 in FIGS. 1 to 12) in the von Frey test. The higher numerical value indicates stronger pain. The horizontal axis represents time (hr) after administration of a test compound. Efficacy was statistically evaluated by a multi-sample unpaired t-test (corrected by Dunnett)(FIGS. 1 to 3 and 10 to 12) or a two-sample unpaired t-test (FIGS. 4 to 9) using the “partial sciatic nerve ligation+distilled water” group (“partial sciatic nerve ligation+distilled water” in the figures) of every measurement time as a control. In the figures, mark “*” indicates that the value is statistically significant (p<0.05) compared to the “partial sciatic nerve ligation+distilled water” group.
According to the results of the von Frey test, oral administration of the compound of Example 13 to 24 (“partial sciatic nerve ligation+the compound of Example 13 to 24” in the figures) showed a statistically significant analgesic action similarly to the positive control, pregabalin (“partial sciatic nerve ligation+pregabalin” in the figures).
From these results, it was clearly demonstrated that a cyclic amine derivative (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof has a strong analgesic effect on neuropathic pain.
Industrial Applicability
Our cyclic amine derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof can be used as medicines for pain symptoms since it can exhibit an analgesic action against pain, in particular, neuropathic pain.
