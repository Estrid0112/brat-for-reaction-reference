FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention provides heterocyclic compounds that modulate the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases-gamma (PI3Kγ) and are useful in the treatment of diseases related to the activity of PI3Kγ including, for example, autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative diseases.
BACKGROUND
The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) belong to a large family of lipid signaling kinases that phosphorylate phosphoinositides at the D3 position of the inositol ring (Cantley, Science, 2002, 296(5573):1655-7). PI3Ks are divided into three classes (class I, II, and III) according to their structure, regulation and substrate specificity. Class I PI3Ks, which include PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ, are a family of dual specificity lipid and protein kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinosito-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) giving rise to phosphatidylinosito-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 functions as a second messenger that controls a number of cellular processes, including growth, survival, adhesion and migration. All four class I PI3K isoforms exist as heterodimers composed of a catalytic subunit (p110) and a tightly associated regulatory subunit that controls their expression, activation, and subcellular localization. PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, and PI3Kδ associate with a regulatory subunit known as p85 and are activated by growth factors and cytokines through a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism (Jimenez, et al., J Biol Chem., 2002, 277(44):41556-62) whereas PI3Kγ associates with two regulatory subunits (p101 and p84) and its activation is driven by the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (Brock, et al., J Cell Biol., 2003, 160(1):89-99). PI3Kα and PI3Kβ are ubiquitously expressed. In contrast, PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ are predominantly expressed in leukocytes (Vanhaesebroeck, et al., Trends Biochem Sci., 2005, 30(4):194-204).
Expression of PI3Kγ is mainly restricted to hematopoietic system, although it can be also detected at lower level in endothelium, heart and brain. PI3Kγ knock-out or kinase dead knock in mice are normal and fertile and do not present any overt adverse phenotypes. Analysis at the cellular level indicates that PI3Kγ is required for GPCR ligand-induced PtdINs (3,4,5)P3 production, chemotaxis and respiratory burst in neutrophils. PI3Kγ-null macrophages and dendritic cell exhibit reduced migration towards various chemoattractants. T-cells deficient in PI3Kγ show impaired cytokine production in response to anti-CD3 or Con A stimulation. PI3Kγ working downstream of adenosine A3A receptor is critical for sustained degranulation of mast cells induced by FCεR1 cross-linking with IgE. PI3Kγ is also essential for survival of eosinophils (Ruckle et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery, 2006, 5, 903-918)
Given its unique expression pattern and cellular functions, the potential role of PI3Kγ in various autoimmune and inflammatory disease models has been investigated with genetic and pharmacological tools. In asthma and allergy models, PI3Kγ−/− mice or mice treated with PI3Kγ inhibitor showed a defective capacity to mount contact hypersensitivity and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions. In these models, PI3Kγ was shown to be important for recruitment of neutrophils and eosinopohils to airways and degranulation of mast cells (see e.g. Laffargue et al., Immunity, 2002, 16, 441-451; Prete et al., The EMBO Journal, 2004, 23, 3505-3515; Pinho et al., L. Leukocyte Biology, 2005, 77, 800-810; Thomas et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 2005, 35, 1283-1291; Doukas et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp Ther. 2009, 328, 758-765).
In two different acute pancreatitis models, genetic ablation of PI3Kγ significantly reduced the extent of acinar cell injury/necrosis and neutrophil infiltration without any impact on secretive function of isolated pancreatic acini (Lupia et al., Am. J. Pathology, 2004, 165, 2003-2011). PI3Kγ−/− mice were largely protected in four different models of rheumatoid arthritis (CIA, α-CII-IA, K/B×N serum transfer and TNF transgenic) and PI3Kγ inhibition suppressed the progression of joint inflammation and damage in the CIA and α-CII-IA models (see e.g., Camps et al., Nat. Medicine, 2005, 11, 939-943; Randis et al., Eur. J. Immunol, 2008, 38, 1215-1224; Hayer et al., FASB J, 2009, 4288-4298). In the MRL-lpr mouse model of human systemic lupus erythematous, inhibition of PI3Kγ reduced glomerulonephritis and prolonged life span (Barber et al., Nat. Medicine, 2005, 9, 933-935).
There is evidence suggesting that chronic inflammation due to infiltration by myeloid-derived cells is a key component in the progression of neurodegeneration diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Giri et al., Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol., 2005, 289, C264-C276; El Khoury et al., Nat. Med., 2007, 13, 432-438). In line with this suggestion, PI3Kγ inhibition was shown to attenuate Aβ(1-40)-induced accumulation of activated astrocytes and microglia in the hippocampus and prevent the peptide-induced congnitive deficits and synaptic dysfunction in a mouse model of AD (Passos et al., Brain Behav. Immun. 2010, 24, 493-501). PI3Kγ deficiency or inhibition also was shown to delay onset and alleviate symptoms in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice, a mouse model of human multiple sclerosis, which is another form of neurodegeneration disease (see e.g., Rodrigues et al., J. Neuroimmunol. 2010, 222, 90-94; Berod et al., Euro. J. Immunol. 2011, 41, 833-844; Comerford et al., PLOS one, 2012, 7, e45095; Li et al., Neuroscience, 2013, 253, 89-99).
Chronic inflammation has been formally recognized as one of the hallmarks for many different types of cancers. Accordingly, selective anti-inflammatory drugs represent a novel class of anti-cancer therapies (Hanahan and Weinberg, Cell, 2011, 144, 646-674). Since PI3Kγ is reported to mediate various inflammatory processes, its role as an immune oncology target has also been investigated. A recent study reported that PI3Kγ deficiency suppressed tumor growth in the syngeneic models of lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and melanoma (LLC, PAN02 and B16). PI3Kγ deficiency or inhibition also inhibited tumor growth in a spontaneous breast cancer model (Schmid et al., Cancer Cell, 2011, 19, 715-727). A further study reported that PI3Kγ deficiency could ameliorate inflammation and tumor growth in mice having colitis-associated colon cancer, (Gonzalez-Garcia et al., Gastroenterology, 2010, 138, 1373-1384). Detailed mechanistic analysis indicates that tumor infiltration by CD11b+ myeloid cells can cause protumorigenic inflammation at tumor sites and PI3Kγ in the myeloid cells is critical in mediating signaling of various chemoattractants in bring the cells to the tumor (Schmid et al., Cancer Cell, 2011, 19, 715-727). Other studies suggest that PI3Kγ is also required for differentiation of naïve myeloid cells into M2 macrophages at tumor sites. M2 macrophages promote tumor growth and progression by secreting immunosuppressive factors such arginase 1, which depletes the tumor microenvironment of arginine, thereby promoting T-cell death and NK cell inhibition (Schmidt et al., Cancer Res. 2012, 72 (Suppl 1: Abstract, 411; Kaneda et al., Cancer Res., 74 (Suppl 19: Abstact 3650)).
In addition to its potential role in promoting protumorigenic microenvironment, PI3Kγ may play a direct role in cancer cells. PI3Kγ is reported to be required for signaling from the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpevirus encoded vGPCR oncogene and tumor growth in a mouse model of sarcoma (Martin et al., Cancer Cell, 2011, 19, 805-813). PI3Kγ was also suggested to be required for growth of T-ALL (Subramanjam et al., Cancer Cell, 2012, 21, 459-472), PDAC and HCC cells (Falasca and Maffucci, Frontiers in Physiology, 2014, 5, 1-10). Moreover, in a survey of driver mutations in pancreatic cancer, PI3Kγ gene was found to contain second highest scoring predicted driven mutation (R839C) among the set of genes not previously identified as a driver in pancreatic cancer (Carter et al., Cancer Biol. Ther. 2010, 10, 582-587).
Finally, PI3Kγ deficiency also has been reported to offer protection to experimental animals in different cardiovascular disease models. For examples, lack of PI3Kγ would reduce angiotension-evoked smooth muscle contraction and, therefore, protect mice from angiotension-induced hypertension (Vecchione et al., J. Exp. Med. 2005, 201, 1217-1228). In rigorous animal myocardial infarction models, PI3Kγ inhibition provided potent cardioprotection, reducing infarct development and preserving myocardial function (Doukas et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2006, 103, 19866-19871).
For these reasons, there is a need to develop new PI3Kγ inhibitors that can be used for the treatment of diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory and cardiac diseases. This application is directed to this need and others.

In some embodiments, the compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of Formula (I) provided herein is crystalline. As used herein, “crystalline” or “crystalline form” is meant to refer to a certain lattice configuration of a crystalline substance. Different crystalline forms of the same substance typically have different crystalline lattices (e.g., unit cells) which are attributed to different physical properties that are characteristic of each of the crystalline forms. In some instances, different lattice configurations have different water or solvent content.
Different crystalline forms of the same compound or salt can have different bulk properties relating to, for example, hygroscopicity, solubility, stability, and the like. Forms with high melting points often have good thermodynamic stability which is advantageous in prolonging shelf-life drug formulations containing the solid form. Forms with lower melting points often are less thermodynamically stable, but are advantageous in that they have increased water solubility, translating to increased drug bioavailability. Forms that are weakly hygroscopic are desirable for their stability to heat and humidity and are resistant to degradation during long storage.
The different crystalline forms can be identified by solid state characterization methods such as by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Other characterization methods such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), dynamic vapor sorption (DVS), and the like further help identify the form as well as help determine stability and solvent/water content.
An XRPD pattern of reflections (peaks) is typically considered a fingerprint of a particular crystalline form. It is well known that the relative intensities of the XRPD peaks can widely vary depending on, inter alia, the sample preparation technique, crystal size distribution, various filters used, the sample mounting procedure, and the particular instrument employed. In some instances, new peaks may be observed or existing peaks may disappear, depending on the type of the instrument or the settings. As used herein, the term “peak” refers to a reflection having a relative height/intensity of at least about 5% of the maximum peak height/intensity. Moreover, instrument variation and other factors can affect the 2-theta values. Thus, peak assignments, such as those reported herein, can vary by plus or minus about 0.2° (2-theta), and the term “substantially” and “about” as used in the context of XRPD herein is meant to encompass the above-mentioned variations.
In the same way, temperature readings in connection with DSC, TGA, or other thermal experiments can vary about ±3° C. depending on the instrument, particular settings, sample preparation, etc. Accordingly, a crystalline form reported herein having a DSC thermogram “substantially” as shown in any of the Figures or the term “about” is understood to accommodate such variation.

Compounds of the invention can be synthesized from intermediates 3-4 using the methods described in Scheme I.
Intermediates for making compounds of the invention can be prepared as shown in Scheme IV. For example, an aryl halide 4-1 can be converted to organometallic reagent 4-2 where M3 is a metal (e.g., MgYa where Ya is a halide) under standard conditions (e.g., in the presence of magnesium and optionally an additive such as 1,2-dibromoethane or lithium chloride). The resulting organometallic reagent 4-2 can be converted to the sulfinate 4-3 under standard conditions (e.g., quenching with sulfur dioxide or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane bis(sulfur dioxide) adduct) and then alkylated with reagent 4-4 where Y9 is a halo group (e.g., Cl, Br, or I) or other leaving group (e.g., OMs or OTs) to give the sulfone 4-5. Halogenation with suitable reagents, such as N-chlorosuccinimide, N-bromosuccinimide, Br2, or N-iodosuccinimide can give halide 4-6 where Y2 is a halo group (e.g., Cl, Br, or I). The Y2 halo can be converted to an appropriate substituted metal (e.g., M2 is B(OH)2, Bpin, BF3K, Sn(Bu)3, or Zn) under standard conditions (e.g., in the presence of a diboron reagent such as bis(pinacolato)diboron, a palladium catalyst, such as dichloro[bis(triphenylphosphoranyl)]palladium or bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), complex with dichloromethane, and a base, such as potassium acetate) to give 4-7.
Alternatively, an aryl halide 4-1 can be directly converted to the sulfonate 4-3 under standard metal-catalyzed conditions (e.g., in the presence of a sulfur dioxide donor, such as potassium metabisulfite, a palladium catalyst such as palladium acetate, ligands such as triphenylphosphine and 1,10-phenathroline, and a base (e.g., sodium formate)) and then alkylated with reagent 4-4 where Y9 is a halo group (e.g., Cl, Br, or I) or other leaving group (e.g., OMs or OTs) to give the sulfone 4-5. The sulfone 4-5 can be halogenated and then metalated to give 4-7. Compounds of the invention can be synthesized from intermediates 4-4 using the methods described in Scheme I.

For example, heteroaromatic amine 5-1, where Y4 is a halogen (e.g., Cl, Br, or I), can be reacted with alpha-halo carbonyl derivative 5-2 where Y5 is a halogen (e.g., Cl or Br), to give heterocycle 5-3. The amino group of 5-3 can be optionally protected with a suitable protecting group P, (e.g., acetyl), under standard conditions (e.g., in the presence of acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride, a base (e.g., triethylamine), and optionally a catalyst (e.g., 4-dimethylaminopyridine)) to give the protected amine 5-4. Compound 5-4 can be halogenated with suitable reagents, such as N-chlorosuccinimide, N-bromosuccinimide, or N-iodosuccinimide, to give halide 5-5 where Y1 is a halo group (e.g., Cl, Br, or I).

Carboxylic acid YY-1 can be converted to a primary amide YY-2 by activation using an alkyl chloroformate (e.g., ethyl chloroformate) in the presence of a base (e.g., Hunig's base or triethylamine) followed by reaction with an ammonia source (e.g., aq. NH4OH solution) to afford primary amide intermediate YY-2. Alternative activating agents can be used in this transformation (e.g., thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride or peptide coupling reagents such as DCC, or HATU).

Alternatively, the carboxylic acid of XX-3 can be converted into carboxylic amides, XX-5, by treatment with an amine in the presence of a coupling reagent and base. The carboxylic acid can also give rise to alcohol XX-6 via reduction. Alcohol XX-6 can be used to afford fluorinated products such as XX-7 by deoxofluorination or oxidation to XX-8, followed by deoxofluorination to afford XX-9. Derivatives such as XX-10 and XX-11 can be prepared by activation of the alcohol to displacement by conversion to a leaving group (e.g., Cl, Br, I, OMs or OTs) and carrying out the displacement with cyanide, amines or heterocycles. Alternatively, optionally protected amines XX-11 can be prepared by reductive amination of aldehyde XX-8.

For example, the administration of many of the chemotherapeutic agents is described in the “Physicians' Desk Reference” (PDR, e.g., 1996 edition, Medical Economics Company, Montvale, N.J.), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference as if set forth in its entirety.
Pharmaceutical Formulations and Dosage Forms
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the invention can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, the compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (excipients). In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, for example, up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g. about 40 mesh.
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art, e.g., see International App. No. WO 2002/000196.
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup, and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate, and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.
In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 5 to about 50 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies compositions containing about 5 to about 10, about 10 to about 15, about 15 to about 20, about 20 to about 25, about 25 to about 30, about 30 to about 35, about 35 to about 40, about 40 to about 45, or about 45 to about 50 mg of the active ingredient.
In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 50 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies compositions containing about 50 to about 100, about 100 to about 150, about 150 to about 200, about 200 to about 250, about 250 to about 300, about 350 to about 400, or about 450 to about 500 mg of the active ingredient.
In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention contain from about 500 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies compositions containing about 500 to about 550, about 550 to about 600, about 600 to about 650, about 650 to about 700, about 700 to about 750, about 750 to about 800, about 800 to about 850, about 850 to about 900, about 900 to about 950, or about 950 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient.
Similar dosages may be used of the compounds described herein in the methods and uses of the invention.
The active compound can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, for example, about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol, and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask, tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, for example, liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white Vaseline, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g. glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, for example, glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2, or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, for example, 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration, and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient, and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers, or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, for example, the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 rig/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
The compositions of the invention can further include one or more additional pharmaceutical agents such as a chemotherapeutic, steroid, anti-inflammatory compound, or immunosuppressant, examples of which are listed herein.
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
Another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating PI3K in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying PI3K ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes PI3K assays that contain such labeled compounds.
The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention. An “isotopically” or “radio-labeled” compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to 2H (also written as D for deuterium), 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. For example, one or more hydrogen atoms in a compound of the present disclosure can be replaced by deuterium atoms (e.g., one or more hydrogen atoms of a C1-6 alkyl group of Formula (I) can be optionally substituted with deuterium atoms, such as-CD3 being substituted for -CH3). The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro PI3K labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I, 131I, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.
It is understood that a “radio-labeled” or “labeled compound” is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S and 82Br.
The present invention can further include synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into compounds of the invention. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are well known in the art, and an ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize the methods applicable for the compounds of invention.
A labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify/evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a PI3K by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the PI3K, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a PI3K (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the PI3K directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.
Kits
The present invention also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, for example, in the treatment or prevention of PI3K-associated diseases or disorders, such as cancer, which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Such kits can further include, if desired, one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, for example, containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the Examples have been found to be PI3Kγ inhibitors according to at least one assay described herein.

The title compound was synthesized according to an experimental procedure analogous to the synthesis of Example 1, Step 2 substituting 2-bromo-1-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzene (Combi-Blocks, OT-1007) for 3-bromo-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.31 (d, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.86 (dd, J=8.1, 2.2 Hz, 1H), 7.34 (d, J=8.1 Hz, 1H), 3.04 (s, 3H), 2.62 (s, 3H), 1.35 (s, 12H). LCMS for C14H22BO4S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=297.1; found 297.1.
Step 2. 6-(2-Fluorophenyl)-3-[2-methyl-5-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine trifluoroacetate
A mixture of 6-bromo-3-iodoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine (Example 16, Step 2, 10. mg, 0.030 mmol), 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-[2-methyl-5-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (10. mg, 0.035 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (2 mg, 0.002 mmol), ethanol (0.52 mL), and 2.0 M Na2CO3 in water (30. μL, 0.059 mmol) was degassed for 5 min with N2. The reaction mixture was then heated in a microwave reactor at 130° C. for 30 min. The reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH and filtered through a plug of Na2SO4 and Celite. The filtrate was concentrated to afford the crude intermediate.
A 1-dram vial was charged with the crude intermediate, (2-fluorophenyl)boronic acid (12 mg, 0.090 mmol), and [1,1']-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II), complex with dichloromethane (5 mg, 0.006 mmol). THF (0.5 mL) and then 1.0 M K2CO3 in water (75 μL, 0.075 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was degassed with N2 for 15 min and then heated at 80° C. for 16 h. Heating was discontinued, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 3 days. The reaction mixture was diluted with MeOH and filtered through a plug of Na2SO4 and Celite. Purification via preparative HPLC on a C-18 column (pH 10, 29-52% MeCN/0.1% NH4OH (aq) over 5 min, 60 mL/min) and then subsequent purification via preparative HPLC on a C-18 column (pH 2, 24-39% MeCN/0.1% TFA (aq) over 5 min, 60 mL/min) afforded the title compound as a white solid (3.3 mg, 22%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, d6-DMSO) δ 8.06-7.91 (m, 3H), 7.81 (s, 1H), 7.75 (d, J=8.0 Hz, 1H), 7.65 (s, 1H), 7.45-7.37 (m, 1H), 7.35-7.20 (m, 2H), 3.26 (s, 3H), 2.31 (s, 3H). LCMS for C20H18FN4O2S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=397.1; found 397.2.
Examples listed in Table 3 were synthesized according to procedures analogous to the synthesis of Example 1, Steps 1 and 2, and Example 13.

Compounds in the following tables were prepared by Method A (default method) or Method B as indicated (See footnote or separate column). Method A: Sulfonamide formation precedes Suzuki coupling (e.g., Example 1, Steps 1 and 2; Example 13); Method B: Sulfonamide formation subsequent to Suzuki coupling (e.g., Example 250). The sulfonamide formation can be executed via Schotten-Baumann conditions (e.g., Example 251, Step 4) and/or using base (e.g. triethylamine or Hunig's base) in polar aprotic solvent (e.g. DMF or DMA) (as in Example 250, Step 5). For instance, Examples listed in Table 4 were synthesized according to procedures analogous to the synthesis of Example 1, Step 1 and 2, and Example 13. The data are listed in Table 4
