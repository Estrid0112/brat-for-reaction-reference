Description of Related Technology
ABC transporters are a family of homologous membrane transporter proteins regulating the transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents (for example drugs, xenobiotics, anions, etc.) that bind and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of these transporters were found to defend malignant cancer cells against chemotherapeutic agents, acting as multidrug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P glycoprotein, or the multidrug resistance protein, MRP 1). So far, 48 ABC transporters, grouped into 7 families based on their sequence identity and function, have been identified.
ABC transporters provide protection against harmful environmental compounds by regulating a variety of important physiological roles within the body, and therefore represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with transporter defects, outwards cell drug transport, and other diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial.
The cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR, is one member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with diseases, which is expressed in a variety of cell types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. The activity of CFTR in epithelial cells is essential for the maintenance of electrolyte transport throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue (Quinton, P. M., 1990. Cystic fibrosis: a disease in electrolyte transport. FASEB J. 4, 2709-2717).
The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (Kerem, B., Rommens, J. M., Buchanan, J. A., Markiewicz, D., Cox, T. K., Chakravarti, A., Buchwald, M., Tsui, L. C., 1989. Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: genetic analysis. Science 245, 1073-1080). CFTR comprises about 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding domain. The pair of transmembrane domains is linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a defect in this gene which induces mutations in CFTR. Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease in humans, and affects ˜0.04% of white individuals (Bobadilla, J. L., Macek, M., Jr, Fine, J. P., Farrell, P. M., 2002. Cystic fibrosis: a worldwide analysis of CFTR mutations--correlation with incidence data and application to screening. Hum. Mutat. 19, 575-606. doi: 10.1002/humu.10041), for example, in the United States, about one in every 2,500 infants is affected, and up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the defective gene without apparent ill effects; moreover subjects bearing a single copy of the gene exhibit increased resistance to cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea. This effect might explain the relatively high frequency of the CF gene within the population.
In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung infections.
In cystic fibrosis patients, mutations in endogenous respiratory epithelial CFTR fails to confer chloride and bicarbonate permeability to epithelial cells in lung and other tissues, thus leading to reduced apical anion secretion and disruptions of the ion and fluid transport. This decrease in anion transport causes an enhanced mucus and pathogenic agent accumulation in the lung triggering microbial infections that ultimately cause death in CF patients.
Beyond respiratory disease, CF patients also suffer from gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that result in death if left untreated. Furthermore, female subjects with cystic fibrosis suffer from decreased fertility, whilst males with cystic fibrosis are infertile.
A variety of disease causing mutations has been identified through sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes (Kerem, B., Rommens, J. M., Buchanan, J. A., Markiewicz, D., Cox, T. K., Chakravarti, A., Buchwald, M., Tsui, L. C., 1989. Identification of the cystic fibrosis gene: genetic analysis. Science 245, 1073-1080). F508delCFTR, the most common CF mutation (present in at least 1 allele in ˜90% of CF patients) and occurring in approximately 70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis, contains a single amino acid deletion of phenylalanine 508. This deletion prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, which protein in turn cannot exit the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and traffic to the plasma membrane, and then is rapidly degraded. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is far less than in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking, the mutation results in defective channel gating. Indeed, even if F508delCFTR is allowed to reach the cell plasma membrane by low-temperature (27° C.) rescue where it can function as a cAMP-activated chloride channel, its activity is decreased significantly compared with WT-CFTR (Pasyk, E. A., Foskett, J. K., 1995. Mutant (F508delCFTR) Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator Cl− channel is functional when retained in Endoplasmic Reticulum of mammalian cells. J. Biol. Chem. 270, 12347-12350).
Other mutations with lower incidence have also been identified that alter the channel regulation or the channel conductance. In case of the channel regulation mutants, the mutated protein is properly trafficked and localized to the plasma membrane but either cannot be activated or cannot function as a chloride channel (e.g. missense mutations located within the nucleotide binding domains), examples of these mutations are G551D, G178R, and G1349D. Mutations affecting chloride conductance have a CFTR protein that is correctly trafficked to the cell membrane but that generates reduced chloride flow (e.g. missense mutations located within the membrane-spanning domain), examples of these mutations are R117H and R334W.
In addition to cystic fibrosis, CFTR activity modulation may be beneficial for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as, for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjögren's syndrome.
COPD is characterized by a progressive and non-reversible airflow limitation, which is due to mucus hypersecretion, bronchiolitis, and emphysema. A potential treatment of mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD could consist in using activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR. In particular, the anion secretion increase across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimize periciliary fluid viscosity. The resulting enhanced mucociliary clearance would help in reducing the symptoms associated with COPD.
Dry eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear production and abnormal tear film lipid, protein and mucin profiles. Many factors may cause dry eye disease, some of which include age, arthritis, Lasik eye surgery, chemical/thermal burns, medications, allergies, and diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Sjögren's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via CFTR could enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands surrounding the eye, and eventually improve corneal hydration, thus helping to alleviate dry eye disease associated symptoms. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease where the immune system harms moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye, mouth, skin, respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. The ensuing symptoms, include, dry eye, mouth, and vagina, as well as lung disease. Sjögren's syndrome is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis/dermatomyositis. The cause of the disease is believed to lie in defective protein trafficking, for which treatment options are limited. As a consequence, modulation of CFTR activity may help hydrating the various organs and help to elevate the associated symptoms.
In addition to CF, the defective protein trafficking induced by the F508delCFTR has been shown to be the underlying basis for a wide range of other diseases, in particular diseases where the defective functioning of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) may either prevent the CFTR protein to exit the cell, and/or the misfolded protein is degraded (Morello, J.-P., Bouvier, M., Petaja-Repo, U. E., Bichet, D. G., 2000. Pharmacological chaperones: a new twist on receptor folding. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 21, 466-469. doi: 10.1016/S0165-6147(00)01575-3; Shastry, B. S., 2003. Neurodegenerative disorders of protein aggregation. Neurochem. Int. 43, 1-7. doi:10.1016/S0197-0186(02)10196-1; Zhang, W., Fujii, N., Naren, A. P., 2012. Recent advances and new perspectives in targeting CFTR for therapy of cystic fibrosis and enterotoxin-induced secretory diarrheas. (Future Med. Chem. 4, 329-345. doi: 10.4155/fmc.12.1).
A number of genetic diseases are associated with a defective ER processing equivalent to the defect observed with CFTR in CF such as glycanosis CDG type 1, hereditary emphysema (α-1-antitrypsin (PiZ variant)), congenital hyperthyroidism, osteogenesis imperfecta (Type I, II, or IV procollagen), hereditary hypofibrinogenemia (fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (α-1-antichymotrypsin), diabetes insipidus (DI), neurohypophyseal DI (vasopressin hormone N2-receptor), nephrogenic DI (aquaporin II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (peripheral myelin protein 22), Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (APP and presenilins), Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive supranuclear palsy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders such as Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type I, spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral pallidoluysian, and myotonic dystrophy, as well as spongiform encephalopathies, such as hereditary Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (lysosomal α-galactosidase A), Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjögren's syndrome.
In addition to up-regulation of the activity of CFTR, anion secretion reduction by CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which epithelial water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR.
Regardless of the cause, excessive chloride transport is seen in all diarrheas, and results in dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death. Acute and chronic diarrheas remain a major medical problem worldwide, and are a significant factor in malnutrition, leading to death in children of less than five years old (5,000,000 deaths/year). Furthermore, in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and/or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), diarrhea is a dangerous condition.
Accordingly, there is a need for novel compounds able to modulate CFTR. In particular, the present invention discloses compounds that may act as CFTR modulators for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. The present invention also provides methods for the preparation of these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by administering the compounds of the invention.

Thus, for example, if a moiety is described as a heteroaryl optionally substituted with up to 3 non-hydrogen radicals, then any heteroaryl with less than 3 substitutable positions would be optionally substituted by up to only as many non-hydrogen radicals as the heteroaryl has substitutable positions. To illustrate, tetrazolyl (which has only one substitutable position) would be optionally substituted with up to one non-hydrogen radical. To illustrate further, if an amino nitrogen is described as being optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, then a primary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to 2 non-hydrogen radicals, whereas a secondary amino nitrogen will be optionally substituted with up to only 1 non-hydrogen radical.

As used herein, “Class I mutation(s)” refers to mutations which interfere with protein synthesis. They result in the introduction of a premature signal of termination of translation (stop codon) in the mRNA. The truncated CFTR proteins are unstable and rapidly degraded, so, the net effect is that there is no protein at the apical membrane. In particular, Class I mutation(s) refers to p.Gly542X (G542X), W1282X, c.489+1G>T (621+1G>T), or c.579+1G>T (711+1G>T) mutation. More particularly, Class I mutation(s) refers to G542X; or W1282X mutations.
As used herein, “Class II mutation(s)” refers to mutations which affect protein maturation. These lead to the production of a CFTR protein that cannot be correctly folded and/or trafficked to its site of function on the apical membrane. In particular, Class II mutation(s) refers to Phe508del (F508del), Ile507del, or Asn1303Lys (N1303K) mutations. More particularly, Class II mutation(s) refers to F508del or N1303K mutations.
As used herein, “Class III mutation(s)” refers to mutations which alter the regulation of the CFTR channel. The mutated CFTR protein is properly trafficked and localized to the plasma membrane but cannot be activated, or it cannot function as a chloride channel. In particular, Class III mutation(s) refers to p.Gly551Asp (G551D), G551S, R553G, G1349D, S1251N, G178R S549N mutations. More particularly, Class III mutation(s) refers to G551D, R553G, G1349D, S1251N, G178R, or S549N mutations.
As used herein, “Class IV mutation(s)” refers to mutations which affect chloride conductance. The CFTR protein is correctly trafficked to the cell membrane but generates reduced chloride flow or a “gating defect” (most are missense mutations located within the membrane-spanning domain). In particular, Class IV mutation(s) refers to p.Arg117His (R117H), R347P, or p.Arg334Trp (R334W) mutations.
As used herein, “Class V mutation(s)” refers to mutations which reduce the level of normally functioning CFTR at the apical membrane or result in a “conductance defect” (for example partially aberrant splicing mutations or inefficient trafficking missense mutations). In particular, Class V mutation(s) refers to c.1210-12T[5] (5T allele), c.S3140-26A>G (3272-26A>G), c.3850-2477C>T (3849+10kbC>T) mutations.
As used herein, “Class VI mutation(s)” refers to mutations which decrease the stability of the CFTR which is present or which affect the regulation of other channels, resulting in inherent instability of the CFTR protein. In effect, although functional, the CFTR protein is unstable at the cell surface and it is rapidly removed and degraded by cell machinery. In particular, Class VI mutation(s) refers to Rescued F508del, 120del23, N287Y, 4326dellTC, or 4279insA mutations. More particularly, Class VI mutation(s) refers to Rescued F508del mutations.

Compounds of the invention are named by using Name 2015 Pack 2 naming algorithm by Advanced Chemical Development or Struct=Name naming algorithm as part of CHEMDRAW® ULTRA v. 12.0.2.1076 or Professional Version 15.0.0.106.
Compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers wherein asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are “R” or “S” depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms “R” and “S” used herein are configurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, in Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30. The invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and these are specifically included within the scope of this invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by methods of resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by precipitation or chromatography and optional liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary as described in Furniss, Hannaford, Smith, and Tatchell, “Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry”, 5th edition (1989), Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex CM20 2JE, England, or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns or (3) fractional recrystallization methods.
Compounds of the invention may exist as cis or trans isomers, wherein substituents on a ring may attached in such a manner that they are on the same side of the ring (cis) relative to each other, or on opposite sides of the ring relative to each other (trans). For example, cyclobutane may be present in the cis or trans configuration, and may be present as a single isomer or a mixture of the cis and trans isomers. Individual cis or trans isomers of compounds of the invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials using selective organic transformations, or prepared in single isomeric form by purification of mixtures of the cis and trans isomers. Such methods are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and may include separation of isomers by precipitation or chromatography.
It should be understood that the compounds of the invention may possess tautomeric forms, as well as geometric isomers, and that these also constitute an aspect of the invention.
The present disclosure includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the disclosure include isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 36Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 15N, oxygen, such as 15O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 18F, 15O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula (I) may generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using an appropriate isotopically-labelled reagents in place of the non-labelled reagent previously employed.
Thus, the formula drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric form, and mixtures thereof, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric, geometric, or stereoisomeric form utilized within the formula drawings.

The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts have been described in S. M. Berge et al. J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66: 1-19.
Compounds of Formula (I) may contain either a basic or an acidic functionality, or both, and can be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, when desired, by using a suitable acid or base. The salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention.
Examples of acid addition salts include, but are not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, malate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl sulfates; long chain halides such as, but not limited to, decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which may be employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid and such organic acids as acetic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, 4-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and citric acid.
Basic addition salts may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety with a suitable base such as, but not limited to, the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali metals or alkaline earth metals such as, but not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine and the like. Other examples of organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine and the like.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” or “prodrug” as used herein, refers to derivatives of the compounds of the invention which have cleavable groups. Such derivatives become, by solvolysis or under physiological conditions, the compounds of the invention which are pharmaceutically active in vivo. Prodrugs of the compounds of the invention are, within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use.
The invention contemplates compounds of Formula (I) formed by synthetic means or formed by in vivo biotransformation of a prodrug.
Compounds described herein may exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.

Chemical Synthetic Procedures
General
The compounds of the invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e. reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) were given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis Third Edition; Greene, T W and Wuts, P G M, Eds.; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 1991).
The following methods are presented with details as to the preparation of a compound of the invention as defined hereinabove and the comparative examples. A compound of the invention may be prepared from known or commercially available starting materials and reagents by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis.
All reagents were of commercial grade and were used as received without further purification, unless otherwise stated. Commercially available anhydrous solvents were used for reactions conducted under inert atmosphere. Reagent grade solvents were used in all other cases, unless otherwise specified. Column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 (35-70 μm). Thin layer chromatography was carried out using pre-coated silica gel F-254 plates (thickness 0.25 mm). Microwave heating was performed with a Biotage® Initiator.
NMR Spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 300 or 400 NMR spectrometer (300 MHz). Chemical shifts (δ ppm) for 1H NMR spectra were reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane (δ ppm 0.00) or the appropriate residual solvent peak, i.e. CHCl3 (δ ppm 7.27), as internal reference. Multiplicities were given as singlet (s), doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), quintuplet (quin), multiplet (m) and broad (br).
Electrospray MS spectra were obtained on Waters Acquity UPLC systems coupled to Waters SQD or SQD2 mass spectrometers. Columns used: Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm ID×50 mm L or Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm ID×30 mm L. The methods used acetonitrile/H2O gradients (both acetonitrile and H2O contained either 0.1% formic acid or 0.05% NH4OH).
For the compounds purified by preparative chromatography, an XBridge™ Prep Guard Column, C18 19×10 mm 5 μm (Waters) with a XBridge™ Prep OBD Column, C18 30×100 mm 5 μm (Waters) and a gradient of 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 50 mL/minute were used.

Determination of Biological Activity
Cell Surface Expression-Horse Radish Peroxidase (CSE-HRP) Assay
A cellular assay for measuring the F508delCFTR cell surface expression after correction with test compounds either without or with a co-corrector (2 μM of 3-[(2R,4R)-4-({[1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl}amino)-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-2-yl]benzoic acid), was developed in human lung derived epithelial cell line (CFBE4lo−) (Veit G et al, (2012) Mol Biol Cell. 23(21): 4188-4202). The development was achieved by expressing the F508delCFTR mutation along with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in the fourth exofacial loop, and then measuring the HRP activity using luminescence readout from these cells, CFBE4lo-F508delCFTR-HRP, that were incubated overnight with the test corrector compounds, either without or with the co-corrector. For this primary assay, the CFBE4lo-F508delCFTR-HRP cells were plated in 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-one; Cat 781080) at 4,000 cells/well along with 0.5 μg/mL doxycycline to induce the F508delCFTR-HRP expression and further incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 72 hours. The test compounds were then added either without or with a co-corrector at the required concentrations and further incubated for 18-24 hours at 33° C. The highest concentration tested was 20 μM with an 8-point concentration response curve using a 3-fold dilution in both the test compound without or with the co-corrector. Three replicate plates were run to determine one EC50. All plates contained negative controls (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) and positive control (2 μM of 3-[(2R,4R)-4-({[1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl}amino)-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-2-yl]benzoic acid) as well as on-plate concentration response of the positive control. Post incubation, the plates were washed 5×times with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), followed by the addition of the HRP substrate, luminol (50 μL), and measuring the HRP activity using luminescence readout on EnVision® Multilabel Plate Reader (Perkin Elmer; product number 2104-0010). The raw counts from the experiment were analyzed using Accelrys® Assay Explorer v3.3.
Z' greater than 0.5 was used as passing quality control criteria for the plates.
The Z' is defined as:
<in-line-formulae>1−[3*SDPositive Control+3*SDNegative Control/Absolute(MeanPositive Control−MeanNegative Control)]</in-line-formulae>
wherein “SD” is standard deviation.
The % activity measured at each of the 8 test concentrations of the test compound added either without or with a co-corrector (2 μM of 3-[(2R,4R)-4-({[1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl}amino)-7-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-2-yl]benzoic acid) was normalized to the on-plate positive control using the following formulae:
<in-line-formulae>% activity(Test compound without co-corrector)=[(test compound without co-corrector response−DMSO response)/(positive control response−DMSO response)]*100</in-line-formulae>
<in-line-formulae>% activity(Test compound with co-corrector)=[(test compound with co-corrector response−DMSO response)/(positive control response−DMSO response)]*100</in-line-formulae>
The maximum % activity achieved for the test compound either without or with a co-corrector at any tested concentration is presented in Table 4 along with the respective EC50's calculated using the following general sigmoidal curve with variable Hill slope equation (described as Model 42 in the Accelrys® Assay Explorer v3.3 software):
<in-line-formulae>y=(a−d)/(1+(x/c)̂B)+d </in-line-formulae>
General sigmoidal curve with concentration, response, top, bottom, EC50 and Hill slope. This model describes a sigmoidal curve with an adjustable baseline, a. The equation can be used to fit curves where response is either increasing or decreasing with respect to the independent variable, “x”.
“x” is a concentration of drug under test.“y” is the response.“a” is the maximum response, and “d” is the minimum response“c” is the inflection point (EC50) for the curve. That is, “y” is halfway between the lower and upper asymptotes when x=c.“b” is the slope-factor or Hill coefficient. The sign of b is positive when the response increases with increasing dose and is negative when the response decreases with increasing dose (inhibition).The data is presented with the qualifiers shown below:
