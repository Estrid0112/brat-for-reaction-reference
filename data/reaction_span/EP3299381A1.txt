FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to technical fields of organic chemistry and pharmaceutical chemistry, specifically to the preparation of water-soluble rapamycin derivatives, and the use thereof in inducing immunosuppression and in the treatment of transplant rejection, solid tumor, fungal infection and vascular disease. More specifically, the present invention relates to a class of water-soluble rapamycin derivatives modified with glutathione, the preparation method thereof, and the use thereof in inducing immunosuppression and in the treatment of transplant rejection, solid tumor, fungal infection and vascular disease.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Rapamycins are novel triene macrolide compounds produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus (Vezina C, et al, J. Antibiot, 1975, 10: 721-726.) or Actinoplane sp. (Nakao K, et al, EP022446, November 11, 1993). Typical rapamycin compounds mainly include Sirolimus, Everolimus, Temsirolimus and the like, which have the structures as follows:
Rapamycin compounds were initially found to have antifungal activities, particularly a relative high inhibitory activity against Candida albicans.
Lately, it was found that rapamycin compounds are inhibitors for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and can act as immunodepressants. The immunosuppressive effect and the effect for preventing immune rejection after organ transplantation of the rapamycin compounds are first disclosed in the FASEB Journal (3, 3411, 1989). The action mechanism is to block the signal transduction via different cytokine receptors, so as to block the progression of Gl-S phase transition of T leukomonocytes and other cells, thereby exerting an immunosuppressive effect.
Rapamycin compounds have been approved to be used in the treatment of multiple indications of tumors on clinic. For example, everolimus has been approved by FDA for the treatment of solid tumors such as advanced breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, angiomyolipoma and the like. Rapamycin compounds were also proved to be effective in the treatment models of diseases such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, anemia and other diseases (Can J. Physiol. Pharmcol. 1997, 55, 48-52). And rapamycin was also reported to have a certain potential effect on prolonging the life cycle of mammals (Harrison DE, et al, Nature, 2009, 460, 392-395).
Rapamycin compounds can be used in multiple indications and have great application value in the clinical treatment. However, owing to the poor water-solubility as well as the poor stability in vivo, the absorption of the rapamycin compounds in vivo is low and so is the bioavailability, which is only 15%-30% (Guy Jerusalem, et al, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 2010, 125:2447-2455). And the administration of rapamycin compounds in a relatively large dosage would bring about more side effects.
In view of the above situation, enhancing the water-solubility of the rapamycin compounds can enhance their bioavailability and improve their therapeutic effect on related diseases to a great extent.
Polypeptide is an endogenous substance in human body. It consists of several amino acids and has a relatively good water solubility and an extensive bioactivity. Combination of polypeptide with a small molecule drug can enhance the solubility of the small molecule drug in one aspect, and can achieve in vivo targeted release and sustained release or improve the bioactivity with the help of the polypeptide in another aspect. For example, glutathione is a common endogenous polypeptide. It consists of glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine. Glutamic acid contains mercapto groups and has antioxidative and integrated antidotal effects. Glutathione is also a nutriment for cell growth. It can be easily taken in by cells, especially by tumor cells which propagate rapidly. A complex which prepared by the coupling of glutathione and a small molecule drug very likely has a selectivity for tumor cells which propagate rapidly and can reduce the toxicity of the anti-tumor drugs to normal cells in human body to some extent and achieve the targeted release of the small molecule drug simultaneously. In addition, glutathione is a water-soluble tripeptide. When it forms a complex with a small molecule drug, the water solubility of the small molecule drug can be improved to a great extent.

The following experiments include the methods and results of studying the water solubility and the in vivo and in vitro activity of the specific compounds according to the present invention. Compounds not listed in the following experiments can also be studied using the same method and idea as those used in the following experiments. The following experiments are merely used to illustrate the methods and results of studying the specific compounds according to the present invention, but not to be limited to the compounds used.
Example 11: Test for solubility in water
Solubility of the compounds according to the present invention can be confirmed through standard experimental procedure. The experiments herein can measure the dissolution profile in water of the compounds according to the present invention.
The operational procedure used for the solubility test is briefly described by taking compounds I-1 and I-2 as examples.
To a 25 ml volumetric flask, 25 mg everolimus was added, and diluted with acetonitrile to volume. The mixture was shaken till all the solid dissolved, obtaining 1 mg/mL everolimus solution in acetonitrile.
1 mg/mL everolimus solution in acetonitrile was added to a 10 ml volumetric flask, and was diluted with acetonitrile by 2 times, 10 times, 100 times and 1000 times, so as to obtain everolimus solutions in acetonitrile with a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL and 0.001 mg/mL, respectively.
Standard curve was plotted using peak areas of the main peaks of HPLC with regard to the everolimus solutions with a concentration of 1 mg/mL, 0.5 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL, 0.001 mg/mL (as shown in Figure 1), obtaining a linear equation as follow: y = 26010x + 18.338 (R2= 1).
10 mg everolimus, 10 mg compound I-1 and 10 mg compound I-2 were added to three 10 mL volumetric flasks, respectively, and diluted with pure water to volume. Each of the three mixtures was shaken till the solid in the volumetric flask stopped to dissolve. Before analyzed by HPLC, 1 mL of each solution was filtrated via a 0.22 µm filter. The solubility of the compounds was calculated from the standard curve using the peak area of the main peak obtained. Results are shown in Table 1.

Compound I-1 & 14138 & 0.54 mg/mL & converted to everolimus
Compound I-2 & 20896 & 0.80 mg/mL & converted to everolimus
</table>
As shown in table 1, the solubility of compound I-1 in water increases at least 540 times as compared with that of everolimus; and the solubility of compound I-2 in water increases at least 800 times as compared with that of everolimus. Accordingly, the water solubility of compounds modified by glutathione is much higher than that of everolimus.
Based on the same study method, comparisons of the solubility between sirolimus/ temsirolimus and the compounds modified by glutathione are carried out, respectively. Results are shown in Table 2 below.

</table>
As shown in table 2, the solubility of compound I-3 and I-4 in water increases at least 470 times and 610 times, respectively, as compared with that of sirolimus; and the solubility of compound I-5, compound I-6 and I-7 in water increases at least 580 times, 710 times and 830 times, respectively, as compared with that of temsirolimus.
Conclusion: the water solubility of the compounds modified by glutathione according to the present invention is greatly improved as compared with those of the parent compounds before modified, i.e., everolimus, sirolimus and temsirolimus. Therefore, glutathione exhibits significant effect on improving the water solubility of rapamycin compounds.

The operational procedure used is briefly described below by taking the inhibitory activity assay against human liver cancer cell HepG2 as an example.
Human liver cancer cell HepG2 grew in the follow medium:Preparation of the growth medium: BRL minimum essential medium with Earle Salts (500 mL), with the addition of the following agents:5 mL BRL MEM non-essential amino acids (10 mM);5 mL BRL penicillin-streptomycin (10000 IU/mL, 10000 µg/mL);5 mL BRL sodium pyruvate solution (100 mM);5 mL BRL L-glutamine (200mM);50 mL BRL calf serum (qualified).
The growth medium is then obtained and ready for use.
The operational procedure for the assay is as follows:1. Cells after being trypsinized were inoculated in 96-well plates at a concentration of 104 cells/well, and allowed to grow in a medium with a final volume of 200 µL. The 96-well plates after inoculation are allowed to stand for 24 hours at 37°C, in order to allow the cells to adhere to the surface of the wells.2. The medium was removed by carefully pipetting without disturbing the cell monolayer. 200 µL Fresh medium was added into each well. It is arranged to make it possible to collect samples from enough wells to run the experiments in triplicate.3. The compounds to be tested according to the present invention were dissolved into 10 µL phosphate buffered solution (PBS) and incubated for 48 h at 37°C.4. In the last 6 h of incubation, cells in each well of the 96-well plates were labeled by 1 microcurie T thymidine (New England Nuclear thymidine), by adding 10 µL PBS containing 1 microcurie T thymidine (which was added into the PBS on the day of collecting the samples for test). The 96-well plates were then returned to the incubator and incubated for the last 6 h.5. Without disturbing the cell monolayer, the radioactive medium was removed by pipetting. Then 50 µL of BRL 10 × trypsin was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 minutes or until the cell monolayer was detached from the bottom (or the wall) of each well. Samples were collected on glass-fiber diskettes using a Skatron 96-well cell harvester. Cells depositing on the glass-fiber diskettes were counted in a Wallac Betaplate counter. The results ofin vitro activity tests are shown in Table 3 and Table 5.

As it can be seen from the data of Table 5, the inhibitory activities of compound I-5 and I-6 against the growth of human liver cancer HepG2, lung cancer cell NCI460, prostate cancer cell DU145, prostate cancer cell PC3, and human breast cancer cell MDA-MB-435 are all higher than or equal to those of temsirolimus. The in vitro inhibitory activity of compound I-7 against cancer cells is equal to or slightly lower than that of temsirolimus.
Conclusion: In vitro activity screening experiments indicate that, the compounds modified at only the 42-position of the macrocycle show in vitro inhibitory activities against cancer cells equal to or slightly superior to those of the parent compounds; while the compounds modified at both the 42-position and the 31-position of the macrocycles show in vitro inhibitory activities against cancer cells equal to or slightly lower than those of the parent compounds. Such differences may probably be due to that the binding ability of the compounds to the target is influenced by the modification at the 31-position, resulting in the decrease of the inhibitory activity against cancer cells. However, the inhibitory activity does not decrease dramatically, which may be owing to that the hydroxyl at the 31-position can be released into the culture medium. Based on the above results of the in vitro activity screening experiments, compound I-1 shows the highest in vitro inhibitory activity against cancer cells.
Therefore, more detailed investigations comprising studies on drug release in serum, in vivo activity and in vivo pharmacokinetics were carried out on compound I-1. The following examples 13-17 only show the effects of compound I-1, but according to the contents disclosed in the present invention, by using the same study method with slightly adaptively adjustment according to common knowledge when necessary, the person skilled in the art can reasonably expect that other compounds according to the present invention not listed herein may show test results similar with those of compound I-1.
Example 13: Tests for drug release in serum by prodrugs
The effects of the compounds according to the present invention as prodrugs of rapamycin can be confirmed by standard operational procedures of pharmacological experiments. The used operational procedures and the obtained results are described briefly below by taking the test for everolimus release of compound I-1 in rats' serum as an example.
10 mL aqueous solution of compound I-1 with a concentration of 1 mg/mL was prepared for use.
10 mL ZnCl2 solution with a concentration of 0.10 mol/L was prepared for use.
1.5 mL blood from ophthalmic artery of rats was injected into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and was centrifuged at 12000 rad/min for 10 min. 300 µl supernate (serum) was pipetted into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. 7 samples of the serum were prepared for use with the same method.
100 µl aqueous solution of compound I-1 was added to each of centrifuge tubes No. 1-6 filled with the serum. As a blank control, 100 µl water was added to centrifuge tube No. 7. Then the tubes were incubated at 37°C in an incubator.
300 µl acetonitrile and 300µl ZnCl2 solution of 0.1mol/L were added to each of centrifuge tubes No. 1-6 at 10 min, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h, and 4h, respectively. The tubes were vortexed homogeneously for 5 min, so as to end the action of the enzyme in the serum on the compounds. 300 µl acetonitrile and 300µl ZnCl2 solution of 0.1 M were added to the centrifuge tube No. 7 at 4h, which was then vortexed homogeneously for 5 min.
Each of the centrifuge tubes No. 1-7 was centrifuged at 12000 rad/min for 15 min. The protein in the serum was removed via centrifuging. 500 µl supernate from each centrifuge tube was drawn for HPLC, thereby measuring the amounts of everolimus and compound I-1 in the supernate at 10 min, 0.5h, 1h, 2h, 3h and 4h, respectively. The test results were shown in Fig. 2.
Conclusion: compound I-1 can slowly release everolimus in rat's serum and substantially release completely in 3 h. Compound I-1 can prolong the action time of everolimus in rats effectively.
Example 14: In vivo inhibitory activity assays of compound I-1 against tumor in nude mice
The in vivo anti-tumor activity of the compounds according to the present invention in nude mice can be confirmed by standard operational procedure of pharmacological experiment. The experiment herein can demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the compounds against the growth of cancer cells in animal body. The operational procedure used and the results obtained are briefly described below by taking the test for inhibitory activity against human lung cancer cell NCI-H460 inoculated in the axilla of nude mice as an example. The experimental method is as follows:NCI-H460 (the 3rd generation) tumors in the rapid proliferation stage inoculated in the axilla of nude mice were cut into tumor lumps with a size of 1mm*1mm*1mm and then were inoculated subcutaneously to the right limb of nude mice using a trocar under a sterile condition. When the tumors grew to 150∼200mm3, the mice were divided into groups and then administrated with the compounds for 4 weeks. The major diameter (a) and the minor diameter (b) of the tumors were measured two or three times a week. The tumor volume (TV) and the relative tumor proliferation rate (T/C) were calculated. The equation for calculating the tumor volume is: TV = 1/2×a×b2. The equation for calculating the relative tumor proliferation rate is T/C = TRTC/CRTV (TRTC: average relative tumor volume in the treatment group; CRTV: average relative tumor volume in the vehicle control group). Tumors were stripped and weighted at Day 28 and the tumor-inhibition rate was calculated with the following equation: (tumor weight of control - tumor weight of experimental group)/tumor weight of control ×100%.Grouping method: the mice were divided into 3 groups with 6 mice per group when the tumors averagely grew to about 195mm3, depending on the growth regularity of the tumor and the dosage regimen. Administration route: intragastrical administration.G1: Control (vehicle, qw 4×, iv)G2: Positive drug group: Everolimus (5mg/kg, qw 4×, iv)G3: compound I-1 (6.8mg/kg, qw 4×, iv) (compound I-1 and everolimus were administrated in an equimolar dosage, i.e., 6.8 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 5 mg of everolimus)
The test results are shown in Tables 6-8 and Figures 3 to 5.

As it can be seen from the data of Table 6 and the increase curve of tumor volume in nude mice shown in Fig. 3, on Day 28, compound I-1 shows a notable inhibitory effect against NCI-H460 in nude mice, with a T/C value of 35% (lower than 40%), while an equimolar amount of everolimus shows a T/C value of 42% (higher than 40%) against NCI-H460 in nude mice. Thus, the inhibitory effect against tumor of the compound I-1 group is superior to that of the everolimus group.

The decrease in body weight can indirectly indicate the toxic and side effect of the drugs on animals. It can be seen from the data in Table 7 and the variation trends of body weight of nude mice shown in Figure 4, the increase in body weight of compound I-1 group (group G3) is larger than that of the control and the positive drug (everolimus) groups (group G1 and G2), while the increase in body weight of the positive drug (everolimus) groups is less than that of the control. Therefore, the toxic and side effect in vivo of compound I-1 is significantly lower than that of everolimus.

The data in Table 8 and the tumor weight in nude rat and the tumor inhibition rate shown in Figure 5 indicate that the tumor inhibition rate of compound I-1 in nude rate is significantly superior to that of everolimus.
Conclusion: At the end of the experiment, the data from the NCI-H460 inoculated nude mice model indicate that: the compound I-1 group is the effective dosage group, which shows a T/C value of lower than 40% (35%) and a tumor inhibition rate of higher than 60% (68%), showing a good inhibitory effect against tumors formed by inoculating NCI-H460 cells; The positive drug (everolimus) group shows a T/C value of higher than 40% (42%) and a tumor inhibition rate of lower than 60% (56%). The in vivo inhibitory activity of compound I-1 against NCI-H460 cells is significantly superior to that of everolimus; and the increase in body weight of the compound I-1 group (group G3) is significantly higher than that of the positive drug (everolimus) group (group G2).

Example 15: Comparative study on the in vivo tumor inhibitory effecacy of compound I-1 via intragastrical administration and injection administration
The anti-tumor activity of the compounds according to the present invention in nude mice can be confirmed by standard operational procedures of pharmacological experiment. Such experiment can demonstrate the inhibitory effect of the compounds according to the present invention against the growth of cancer cells in animal body.
DU145 (the 3rd generation) tumors in the rapid proliferation stage inoculated in the axilla of nude mice were cut into tumor lumps with a size of 1mm*1mm*1mm and then were inoculated subcutaneously to the right limb of nude mice using a trocar under a sterile condition. When the tumors grow to 150∼200mm3, the mice were randomly divided into three groups and then administrated with the compounds for 4 weeks. The major diameter (a) and the minor diameter (b) of the tumors were measured 2 or 3 times a week. The tumor volume (TV) was calculated with the following equation: TV = 1/2×a×b2. Tumors were stripped and weighted at Day 28 and the tumor inhibition rate was calculated using the following equation: (tumor weight of control - tumor weight of experimental group)/tumor weight of control ×100%.
The nude mice were divided into 3 groups with 4 mice per group when the tumors averagely grew to about 185-200 mm3, depending on the growth regularity of the tumor and the dosage regimen.G1: positive drug group: Everolimus (5mg/kg, qw, 4w, 3×/w); administration route: intragastrical administration;G2: compound I-1 (3.4mg/kg, qw, 4w, 3×/w) (3.4 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 2.5 mg of everolimus); administration route: tail vein injection;G3: compound I-1 (1.7mg/kg, qw, 4w, 3×/w) (1.7 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 1.25 mg of everolimus); administration route: tail vein injection.

The decrease in body weight can indirectly indicate the toxic and side effect of the drugs on animals. It can be seen from the data in Table 10 that: the increase trend of body weight of the injection administration groups (group G2 and G3) is larger than that of the intragastrical administration group (group G1). Therefore, injection administration of compound I-1 does not result in obvious toxic and side effect.
Conclusion: The water solubility of compound I-1 is significantly improved. Compound I-1 can be dissolved in normal saline and the resulted solution is stable. Thus, the bioavailability of the compound in vivo can be significantly enhanced via injection administration. The test results indicate that injection administration of compound I-1 in a dosage equivalent to a quarter of that of everolimus can achieve the same tumor inhibitory effect as that of intragastrical administration of everolimus.
Example 16: In vivo inhibitory activity assays of compound I-1 against human renal cell carcinoma OS-RC-2 in nude mice
OS-RC-2 (the 3rd to 10th generation) tumors in the rapid proliferation stage inoculated in the axilla of nude mice were cut into tumor lumps with a size of 1mm*1mm*1mm and then were inoculated subcutaneously to the right limb of nude mice using a trocar under a sterile condition. When the tumors grew to 167 mm3, the mice were randomly divided into groups and administrated with the compounds. The major diameter (a) and the minor diameter (b) of the tumors were measured 2 or 3 times a week. The tumor volume (TV) was calculated with the following equation: TV = 1/2×a×b2. The experiment was terminated and tumors were stripped and weighted. The tumor inhibition rate was calculated.
Grouping method: the mice were divided into 7 groups with 6 mice per group when the tumors averagely grew to 167 mm3:1) G1: control (vehicle);2) G2: everolimus (2mg/kg ig 3×/qw);3) G3: everolimus (6mg/kg ig 3×/qw);4) G4: compound I-1 (8.12mg/kg ig 3×/qw) (compound I-1 and group G3 of everolimus were administrated in an equimolar dosage, i.e., 8.12 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 6 mg of everolimus);5) G5: compound I-1 (2.0mg/kg iv 3×/qw) (2.0 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 1.5 mg of everolimus);6) G6: compound I-1 (8.12mg/kg iv 3×/qw) (8.12 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 6 mg of everolimus)7) G7: compound I-1 (32.7mg/kg iv 1×/qw) (32.74 mg of compound I-1 equivalent to 24 mg of everolimus).
The test results are shown in Tables 11, 12 and Figures 7 and 8.

As it can be seen from the increase trend of the tumor volumes in nude mice shown in Fig. 7, for the nude mice which were administrated with everolimus orally three times a week (Group G2 and G3), neither the high-dose group of 6 mg/Kg nor the low-dose group of 2 mg/Kg can effectively inhibit the increase of tumor volumes in nude mice after 32 days; while for the compound I-1 groups via injection administration (Groups G5, G6 and G7), either a low-dose administration (2.0 mg/Kg) 3 times a week or a high-dose administration (32.7 mg/Kg) once a week shows a good tumor inhibitory effect.
The final weight of the tumors in nude mice and the calculated tumor inhibition rate shown in Table 11 further indicate that, either a low-dose injection administration or a high-dose injection administration of compound I-1 (groups G5, G6 and G7) shows a good tumor inhibitory effect, with a tumor inhibitory rate of 57.1%, 59.9% and 60.6%, respectively, which are all significantly superior to that of the everolimus groups (group G2 and G3). Among others, the high-dose injection administration of compound I-1 once a week shows the best effect, with a tumor inhibition rate of up to 60.6%. Meanwhile, even if compound I-1 is administrated in an equimolar dosage of everolimus via the same administration route, the tumor inhibition rate of compound I-1 is significantly higher than that of everolimus (comparing G4 with G3, the tumor inhibition rate is 55.6% and 41.1%, respectively).

The body weight can indirectly reflect the toxicity of the drugs. The data in Table 12 and Figure 8 show that the body weight of the nude mice in the blank control decreases greatly with a decrease rate of up to 33.0%. Such situation may be probably due to the nutritional deficiency caused by the growth of the tumor. Moreover, the decrease rate of body weight in the drug treatment group is lower than that in the blank control. Among others, the high-dose compound I-1 groups (groups G6 and G7) show a decrease rate in body weight of 11.7% and 10.7%, respectively; while the everolimus groups via oral administration (groups G2 and G3) show a decrease rate in body weight of 17.4% and 11.7%, respectively. Comparing with the everolimus groups via oral administration, the high-dose compound I-1 group does not show a notable toxicity. Thus, the mice show a good tolerance for the high-dose compound I-1 via injection administration. And no notable toxic effect was observed.
Conclusion: Via the high-dose administration of compound I-1 once weekly, the growth of renal cell carcinoma in nude mice can be inhibited effectively, with a tumor inhibition rate of up to 60.6%; while the everolimus group via oral administration of 6 mg/kg three times a week provides a tumor inhibition rate of only 41.1% in nude mice. The administration by injection once weekly can raise the treatment compliance of the advanced cancer patients on clinic. And the mice show a relative good tolerance for the high-dose compound I-1 via injection administration. No notable toxic effect was observed.
Example 17: In vivo pharmacokinetic study of compound I-1 in rats
To further study the in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics of compound I-1 in rats, compound I-1 was administrated to SD rats via intravenous injection. The in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics and bioavailability of everolimus released in rats were measured, and compared with the pharmacokinetic characteristics of everolimus via oral administration. The administration route and sampling frequency are shown in the following Table 13.

From the above Table 14 to Table 16 and the plasma concentration-time curve (Figure 9), rats administrated with 10 mg/Kg of everolimus orally show a relative low average plasma concentration. But for rats injected with compound I-1 in a dosage equivalent to one fifth of that of everolimus administrated orally (2 mg/Kg), the mean plasma concentration of everolium released in rats is much higher than that released by everolium orally administrated. The area under the curve (AUC) plotted by plasma concentration of everolimus released in the rats injected with 2.72 mg/Kg of compound I-1 (equivalent to 2 mg/Kg of everolimus), vs. time is about 2500; while the area under the curve plotted by plasma concentration of everolimus in the rats orally administrated with everolimus, vs. time is merely about 450. Thus, in the case of injecting compound I-1 in a dosage of one fifth of that of everolimus via oral administration, the bioavailability of everolimus released in vivo by the injected compound I-1 is 5 to 6 times to that by orally administrated everolimus.
Conclusion: the bioavailability of everolimus administrated orally is extremely low, but compound I-1 administrated via injection can completely release a considerable amount of everolimus. Thus the problem that the bioavailability of everolimus is not high is dissolved.
In summary, it is revealed based on the above study that:1) Characteristics of rapamycin, such as a poor water solubility and an unstable chemical structure in vivo, are the main reasons for its poor bioavailability. Thus, improving the water solubility and enhancing the structural stability in vivo of rapamycin is the key point for improving its bioavailability. The rapamycin compounds modified with glutathione can significantly improve its water solubility. The compounds after modification can be well dissolved in normal saline with stable structures, and thus can be used for injection. As a result, the bioavailability of the rapamycin compounds in vivo is significantly improved.2) The compounds after modification can gradually release the original drugs in the serum of rats. Thus, they can show a sustained-release effect and prolong the action time of drugs in vivo.3) The in vivo and in vitro tests on animals indicate that the compounds after modification show a higher tumor inhibitory activity and a lower toxicity in vivo as compared with the original compounds.
