BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of death by cancer in the United States with estimated 48,960 new cases and 40,560 deaths in 2015 (Siegel, R. L. et al. CA. Cancer J. Clin. 2015, 65, 5-29). With a five-year overall survival rate of merely 7 percent, PDAC is the most lethal cancer among major malignancies. Its poor prognosis is partly due to the fact that PDAC is usually diagnosed at advanced stages. Moreover, pancreatic cancer cells acquire a large number of genetic mutations and are notoriously resistant to apoptotic cell death, an established cancer cell-killing mechanism elicited by anti-cancer agents (Jones, S. et al. Science 2008, 321, 1801-1806; and Hezel, A. F. et al. Genes Dev. 2006, 20, 1218-1249). Despite numerous efforts, there still is a dire lack of effective therapeutic options for advanced pancreatic cancer (Garrido-Laguna, I. et al. Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2015, 12, 319-334; and Spadi, R. et al. World J. Clin. Oncol. 2016, 7, 27-43). Modulation of macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) has been proposed as a promising strategy (Gomez, V. E. et al. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2015, 35, 11-19).
Autophagy is a conserved cellular process through which cytosolic components, such as proteins and organelles, are sequestered, degraded, and recycled (He, C. et al. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009, 43, 67-93; and Choi, A. M. et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2013, 368, 651-662). The precise roles of autophagy in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy still remain to be defined due to the heterogeneous nature of cancers and the complexity of the autophagy machinery (Galluzzi, L. et al. EMBO J. 2015, 34, 856-880). Studies have shown that autophagy plays different or even opposite roles depending on the cancer type and the stage of tumor progression. Currently, it is generally accepted that autophagy behaves as a tumor suppressor in normal cells in part because it removes damaged cellular components. Nevertheless, increasing evidence shows that autophagy is a cytoprotective mechanism often exploited by established cancer cells to cope with their harsh microenvironment and cellular stresses induced by chemotherapies. A number of anticancer agents with diverse mechanisms of action have been shown to induce autophagy (Sui, X. et al. Cell Death Dis. 2013, 4, e838; and Dong, Z. et al. Blood Rev. 2016, doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2016.04.005). More importantly, autophagy inhibitors enhance the efficacy of many anticancer agents (Sui, X. et al. Cell Death Dis. 2013, 4, e838). For pancreatic cancer, it has been shown that autophagy is elevated and required for de novo tumor growth and inhibition of autophagy leads to robust tumor regression (Fujii, S. et al. Cancer Sci. 2008, 99, 1813-1819; and Yang, S. et al. Genes Dev. 2011, 25, 717-729); however, the status of p53, whose mutation is commonly seen in pancreatic cancer patients, may determine the outcome of autophagy inhibition (Rosenfeldt, M. T. et al. Nature 2013, 504, 296-300; and Yang, A. et al. Cancer Discov. 2014, 4, 905-913). Despite the complexity of autophagy inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, these studies suggest that disabling the pro-survival autophagy machinery hijacked by cancer cells might represent a viable approach to promote cell death and reduce drug resistance in refractory cancers such as pancreatic cancer (Gomez, V. E. et al. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2015, 35, 11-19; and Sui, X. et al. Cell Death Dis. 2013, 4, e838).
Therefore, there is a need for new compounds to treat cancer, especially pancreatic cancer.

In cases where compounds are sufficiently basic or acidic, a salt of a compound of formula I can be useful as an intermediate for isolating or purifying a compound of formula I. Additionally, administration of a compound of formula I as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base salt may be appropriate. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are organic acid addition salts formed with acids which form a physiological acceptable anion, for example, tosylate, methanesulfonate, acetate, citrate, malonate, tartarate, succinate, benzoate, ascorbate, α-ketoglutarate, and α-glycerophosphate. Suitable inorganic salts may also be formed, including hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, bicarbonate, and carbonate salts.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art, for example by reacting a sufficiently basic compound such as an amine with a suitable acid affording a physiologically acceptable anion. Alkali metal (for example, sodium, potassium or lithium) or alkaline earth metal (for example calcium) salts of carboxylic acids can also be made.
The compounds of formula I can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, topical or subcutaneous routes.
Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
The active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.
Useful dosages of the compounds of formula I can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.

Example 79. Cell Viability Assay
MIA PaCa-2 cells (CRL-1420, ATCC) were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2.5% HS, 1% GlutaMAX, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Cell culture media and additives were purchased from Gibco. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at |1−2.5|×104 cells per well in the DMEM growth media. One microliter of a 2-fold serially diluted compound solution in DMSO (Sigma) starting at 20 mM (100 μM final concentration) was added to each well. The final volume in each well was 200 μL, yielding a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Control wells contained 0.5% DMSO (100% viability) or 25% DMSO (background) and all reactions were done in triplicate. The plate was incubated for 72 h at 37° C. in a 5% CO2/95% air humidified atmosphere.
Measurement of cell viability was carried out using a modified method of Mosmann based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma). MTT solution was prepared fresh at 1 mg/mL in serum-free and phenol red-free RPMI 1640 media. After 200 μL of MTT solution was added to each well, the plate was incubated as described above for 3 h. The MTT solution was removed, and the formazan crystals were solubilized with 200 μL of isopropanol. The plate was read on a SpectraMax i3 spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) at 570 nm for formazan and 650 nm for background subtraction. EC50 values were calculated by fitting the data in GraphPad Prism software. EC50 values were determined in triplicate. Results are demonstrated in Tables 1-9.

Example 82. In Vitro ADME Evaluation
Plasma Stability Assay
The plasma stability assay was performed in triplicate by incubating a compound in normal mouse and human plasma at 37° C. At 0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 h, aliquots of the plasma mixture were taken and quenched with 3 volumes of acetonitrile containing an appropriate internal standard. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the remaining percentage at various time points. Data for representative compounds is provided in Table 12.
Microsomal Stability Assay
The in vitro microsomal stability assay was conducted in triplicate in mouse and human liver microsomal systems. In a typical incubation, a compound (typically 1 μM final concentration) was spiked into the reaction mixture containing 0.5 mg/mL of liver microsomal protein and 1 mM of NADPH in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37° C. At various time points, 1 volume of reaction aliquot was taken and quenched with 3 volumes of acetonitrile with an appropriate internal standard. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatants were collected and analyzed by LC-MS/MS to determine the in vitro metabolic half-life (t1/2) and intrinsic clearance (CLint). Verapamil was used as a positive control. Data for representative compounds is provided in Table 12.
LC-MS/MS Bioanalysis
Quantification and analysis of compounds in biological samples were carried out on an AB Sciex QTrap 5500 mass spectrometer coupled with an Agilent 1260 Infinity HPLC. The chromatographic separation of compounds was achieved using a Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column (50×2.1 mm, 2.6 μm), and MS/MS analysis was conducted using an ESI ion source with MRM detection. The MS/MS detection parameters including declustering potential (DP), entrance potential (EP), collision energy (CE), and collision cell exit potential (CXP) were optimized for each compound.
Thermodynamic Solubility Assay
The aqueous solubility of a test compound was determined in DPBS (pH=7.4) under thermodynamic solubility conditions. Briefly, a saturated solution was made by adding DPBS to the solid compound. The mixture was shaken at 200 rpm for 48 h in a MaxQ 6000 orbital shaker at ambient temperature to allow equilibrium between the solid and dissolved compound. The suspension was then filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF syringe filter and the filtrate was collected for analysis using UV spectrometry (SpectraMax M5e, Molecular Devices) at λ=240 nm. Data for representative compounds is provided in Table 12.

Example 83. Caco-2 Permeability Assay
Cell Culture.
The human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.), and was cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37° C. Caco-2 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% NEAA, 1% GlutaMax and 1% penicillin and streptomycin solution. The culture medium was changed every other day during cell growth and differentiation. On achieving 80-90% confluence, the cells were rinsed with pre-warm DPBS (pH 7.4) and split using trypsin. The cells were then seeded on membranes of Millipore Millicell-24 cell culture device. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) were assessed to reflect membrane integrity using a Millicells® ERS-2 (Millipore, USA). The Caco-2 cell monolayers were used for transport experiments on day 21 post-seeding with TEER values >500 Ω·cm2.
Bidirectional Transport Experiments.
Before the transport experiments, the cell monolayer was washed three times with HBSS. Then, the plates were incubated in fresh permeability assay buffer (HBSS containing 10 mM glucose and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) at 37° C. The experiments were conducted by spiking test compounds to either the apical (AP, 0.4 mL) or basolateral side (BL, 0.8 mL), while the receiving chamber contained the corresponding volume of pre-warmed permeability assay buffer. Every experiment was repeated in duplicate, and the plates were incubated in an orbital shaker at 37° C., 50 rpm/min. To assess the drug transport, at the incubation time of 20, 40, 60 and 80 min, aliquot was removed and was immediately replenished with an equal volume of permeability assay buffer. The samples were then subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis. The apparent permeability coefficient was indicated by the absorption rate constant Papp. It could be calculated as PBA (measured in BL to AP direction) or PAB (measured in AP to BL direction), using the equation of Papp=(dQ/dt)/(A×C0). dQ/dt is the rate at which the compound appears in the receiver chamber (nmol/s), A is the surface area of the filter membrane (0.7 cm2) and C0 is the initial concentration in the donor chamber (μM). Efflux ratio (ER) was calculated by the equation of ER=PBA/PAB, where PBA is the Papp value measured in BL to AP direction, and PAB is the Papp value measured in AP to BL direction. Data for representative compounds is provided in Table 13.
