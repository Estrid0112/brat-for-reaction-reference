TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel heterocyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device comprising the same.
BACKGROUND ART
In general, the term “organic light-emitting phenomenon” refers to a phenomenon in which electrical energy is converted to light energy by means of an organic material.
An organic light-emitting device using the organic light-emitting phenomenon has a structure usually including an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. In this regard, the organic material layer may have, for the most part, a multilayer structure consisting of different materials, for example, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. In the organic light-emitting device having such a structure, application of a voltage between the two electrodes injects a hole from the anode and an electron from the cathode to the organic layer. In the luminescent zone, the hole and the electron recombine to produce an exciton. When the exciton returns to the ground state from the excited state, the molecule of the organic layer emits light. Such an organic light-emitting device is known to have characteristics such as self-luminescence, high luminance, high efficiency, low driving voltage, a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response.
The materials used as organic layers in organic light-emitting devices may be divided into luminescent materials and charge-carrying materials, for example, a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron injection material, and an electron transport material. As for the luminescent materials, there are two main families according to molecular weight: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. The light-emitting mechanism forms the basis for classification of the luminescent materials as fluorescent or phosphorescent materials, which use excitons in singlet and triplet states, respectively. Further, luminescent materials may be divided according to color into blue, green, and red light-emitting materials. Further, yellow and reddish yellow light-emitting materials have been developed in order to achieve more natural colors.
Meanwhile, when a single material is employed as the luminescent material, intermolecular actions cause the wavelength of maximum luminescence to shift toward a longer wavelength, resulting in reduced color purity and light emission efficiency due to the light attenuation. In this regard, a host-dopant system may be used as a luminescent material so as to increase the color purity and the light emission efficiency through energy transfer.
This is based on the principle whereby, when a dopant is smaller in energy band gap than a host accounting for the light-emitting layer, the addition of a small amount of the dopant to the host generates excitons from the light-emitting layer so that the excitons are transported to the dopant, emitting light at high efficiency. Here, light of desired wavelengths can be obtained depending on the kind of dopant because the wavelength of the host moves to the wavelength range of the dopant.
In order for organic light-emitting devices to sufficiently exhibit the aforementioned outstanding properties, materials accounting for organic layers in the devices, for example, hole injection materials, hole transport materials, light-emitting materials, electron transport materials, electron injection materials, etc., should be based on stable and effective materials in advance.
Application of an electric current to such an organic light-emitting device induces the injection of holes and electrons from the anode and the cathode, respectively. After being transported respectively by a hole transport layer and an electron transport layer, the injected holes and electrons recombine in a light-emitting layer to produce excitons. The excitons return to the ground state, emitting light. According to the light-emitting mechanism, the light is classified as fluorescence emission with singlet transition to singlet and phosphorescence emission with triplet transition singlet. The fluorescence and the phosphorescence may be used as luminescent light sources of organic light-emitting devices.
In fluorescent organic light-emitting devices, only the formation of singlet excitons results in the emission of useful radiation, and thus there is a theoretical limit of 25% in the internal quantum efficiency of fluorescent organic light-emitting devices. On the other hand, phosphorescent light, which uses triplet excitons, has been extensively studied because its emission efficiency is far superior to that of fluorescent light.
So far, the most widely known phosphorescent host material is CBP, and organic light-emitting devices employing a hole barrier layer of BCP, BAlq, etc. are also known.
However, although devices employing phosphorescent materials are higher in terms of efficiency than those employing fluorescent materials, conventional phosphorescent host materials, such as BAlq or CBP, have room for improvement because they require high driving voltages and are unsatisfactory in terms of lifespan.
With regard to related arts pertaining to such phosphorescent materials for use in light-emitting devices, reference may be made to Korean Patent Publication No. 10-2011-0013220 A (Feb. 9, 2011), which discloses an organic compound having a 6-membered aromatic or heteroaromatic ring frame grafted with an aromatic heterocyclic ring, and Japanese Patent Publication No. 2010-166070 A (Jul. 29, 2010), which discloses an organic compound having a substituted or unsubstituted pyrimidine or quinazoline frame grafted with an aryl or heteroaryl ring.
Despite enormous efforts to prepare luminescent materials for use in organic light-emitting devices or electron transport materials, there is still a continued need to develop organic light-emitting devices that exhibit higher light emission efficiency and which can be driven at low voltages.

Below, the organic light-emitting device of the present invention is explained with reference to FIG. 1.
FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of the structure of an organic light-emitting device according to some embodiments of the present invention. The organic light-emitting device includes an anode 20, a hole transport layer 40, an organic light-emitting layer 50, an electron transport layer 60, and a cathode 80, and optionally a hole injection layer 30 or an electron injection layer 70. In addition, one or two Intermediate layers may be further formed in the organic light-emitting device. A hole barrier layer or an electron barrier layer may be also further established.
Reference is made to FIG. 1 with regard to the organic light-emitting device of the present invention and the fabrication thereof. First, a substrate 10 is coated with an anode electrode material to form an anode 20 thereon. So long as it is used in a typical organic EL device, any substrate may be used as the substrate 10. Preferable is an organic substrate or transparent plastic substrate that exhibits excellent transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and waterproofness. As the anode electrode material, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO2), or zinc oxide (ZnO), which are transparent and superior in terms of conductivity, may be used.
A hole injection layer material is applied to the top of the anode electrode 20 by thermal deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating to form a hole injection layer 30. Subsequently, using thermal deposition in a vacuum or spin coating, a hole transport layer material is applied to the hole injection layer 30 to form a hole transport layer 40.
So long as it is typically used in the art, any hole injection layer material may be used in the present invention, without particular limitations. Examples include 2-TNATA [4,4',4″-tris(2-naphthylphenyl-phenylamino)-triphenylamine], NPD[N,N'-di(l-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine)], TPD[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine], DNTPD[N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis-[4-(phenyl-m-tolyl-amino)-phenyl]-biphenyl-4,4'-dia mine], and the like, but are not limited thereto.
Further, any material that is typically known in the art may be used for the hole transport layer without particular limitations. Examples include N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-[1,1-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (TPD) and N,N'-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (a-NPD), but are not limited thereto.
Then, an organic light-emitting layer 50 is deposited on the hole transport layer 40, optionally followed by the formation of a hole barrier layer (not shown) on the organic light-emitting layer 50 by deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating. When holes traverse the organic light-emitting layer and are introduced into the cathode, the efficiency and lifespan of the device are deteriorated. Formed of a material with a low HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level, the hole barrier layer serves to prevent the introduction of holes into the cathode. Any material that has a higher ionization potential than the light-emitting compound and which is also able to carry electrons may be used for the hole barrier layer without limitations. Representative among hole barrier materials are BAlq, BCP, and TPBI.
For use in the hole barrier layer, selection may be made of BAlq, BCP, Bphen, TPBI, NTAZ, BeBq2, OXD-7, Liq, and any compound of Chemical Formulas 1001 to 1007, but is not limited thereto.

Using a vacuum deposition method or a spin-coating method, an electron transport layer 60 may be deposited on the hole barrier layer and may then be overlaid with an electron injection layer 70. A cathode metal is deposited on the electron injection layer 70 by thermal deposition in a vacuum to form a cathode 80, thus obtaining an organic EL device. Here, the cathode may be made of lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al-Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg-In), or magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag). For a top-emitting device, a transparent cathode made of ITO or IZO may be employed.
The light-emitting layer may include a host and a dopant.
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the light-emitting layer preferably ranges in thickness from 50 to 2,000 Å.
The dopant used in the light-emitting layer may be at least one selected from among the compounds represented by the following General Formula A-1:

Examples: Fabrication of Organic Light-Emitting Device
An ITO glass substrate was patterned to have a translucent area of 2 mm×2 mm and cleansed. The ITO glass was mounted in a vacuum chamber that was then set to have a base pressure of 1×106 torr. On the ITO glass substrate, films were formed of organic compounds in the order of DNTPD (700 Å), α-NPB (300 Å), compounds prepared according to the present invention+RD-1 (10%) (300 Å), Compound E: Liq=1:1 (250 Å), Liq (10 Å), and Al (1,000 Å). The light-emitting devices thus obtained were measured at 0.4 mA for luminescence properties.
