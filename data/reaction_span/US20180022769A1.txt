TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivatives and use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acids, fluorine-containing bisphosphonate ester derivatives and pharmaceutical compositions, lymphocyte-treating agents, antitumor immune cell therapy agents, anti viral infection immune cell therapy agents and the like, each containing said derivative as an active ingredient.
BACKGROUND ART
Bisphosphonic acids are a group of compounds having a P-C-P skeleton, and show high bone tissue penetration and high affinity for bone. In addition, when the first generation bisphosphonic acids such as etidronic acid, clodronic acid and the like are selectively incorporated into monocytic cells such as osteoclasts and the like by liquid-phase endocytosis, they are metabolically converted to ATP analogs, act antagonistically to ATP receptors and show cytotoxicity. Thus, the first generation bisphosphonic acids suppress bone resorption by inducing cell death in osteoclasts. Utilizing such property, bisphosphonic acids are applied to various bone-related diseases. To be specific, they are used as prophylactic or therapeutic drugs for diseases relating to the fragility of bone and calcium concentration variation such as osteoporosis, osteitis deformans, osteogenesis imperfecta and hypercalcemia in malignant tumor. In addition, bisphosphonic acids belonging to the second generation such as pamidronic acid, alendronic acid, ibandronic acid and the like, and bisphosphonic acids belonging to the third generation such as risedronic acid, zoledronic acid and the like contain a nitrogen atom in the side chain, and are called nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acids. When these bisphosphonic acids are selectively incorporated into monocytic cells such as osteoclast and the like, they specifically inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase and show cytotoxicity. Utilizing the properties thereof, various nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acids have been used as improving-drugs for osteoporosis and hypercalcemia in malignant tumor. Recently, moreover, it has been reported that the disease-free survival is preferentially extended when zoledronic acid is used as an adjuvant therapy drug in the endocrine therapy and chemotherapy of premenopausal estrogen sensitive early breast cancer cases and multiple myeloma (non-patent documents 1, 2). This is considered to be because nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acid has direct cytotoxicity and/or indirect cytotoxicity via activation of immunocytes on tumor cells and shows an antitumor effect.
For example, a part of etidronic acid or clodronic acid administered to a living body enters into the cell by a fluid phase endocytosis action, is transferred to nucleoside monophosphate, and converted to a nucleoside triphosphate analog compound. A metabolite thereof is shown to antagonistically inhibit biological enzyme reaction utilizing high energy phosphate bond of nucleoside triphosphate. When the incorporating cell is osteoclast, bone resorption is suppressed, and the concentration of calcium in the plasma decreases. In the case of tumor cells, the tumor cells are injured and a direct antitumor effect is expected.
The second generation and third generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acids transferred into the cell have been shown to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase involved in the biosynthesis pathway of isoprenoidal metabolites such as cholesterol and the like. Such enzyme catalyzes a reaction to synthesize geranyl diphosphate from isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate, and a reaction to synthesize farnesyl diphosphate from isopentenyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate. Therefore, inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase is considered to shut off the metabolic pathway located downstream of geranyl diphosphate, as well as cause accumulation of isopentenyl diphosphate to be an enzyme substrate. When the biosynthesis pathway located downstream of geranyl diphosphate is shut off, isoprenoidal compounds such as cholesterol, liposoluble vitamins, bile acid, lipoprotein and the like are not biosynthesized, and the proliferation of tumor cells is considered to be suppressed.
Generally, the isopropenyl group of farnesyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate biosynthesized by farnesyl diphosphate synthase is transferred to, what is called, small G proteins such as Ras, Rho, Rap, Rab, Rac and the like. The small G protein having the transferred isopropenyl group is translocated to a cellular membrane, which is an inherent action site of small G protein, since the isopropenyl group functions as a cellular membrane anchor, and exhibits important physiological functions such as cell proliferation, adhesion and the like. However, when nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acid such as zoledronic acid and the like inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, transfer of the isopropenyl group is inhibited, translocation to the membrane of small G protein is prevented, and, as a result, tumor cell proliferation is inhibited. This is one of the mechanisms that explain direct antitumor effects shown by nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acid.
When farnesyl diphosphate synthase is further inhibited, the intracellular concentration of isopentenyl diphosphate as a substrate thereof increases. The increase in the intracellular concentration of isopentenyl diphosphate is detected by a butyrophilin 3A1 transmembrane type protein, and the change thereof is recognized by γδ T cells having a Vγ2Vδ2 T cell receptor (non-patent documents 3, 4). As a result, the γδ T cells are degranulated to release perforin and granzyme B, which induces apoptosis of tumor cells and virus infected cells. It is shown that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acid indirectly and efficiently damage tumor cells and virus-infected cells via activation of immunocyte.
The direct and indirect cytotoxicity by the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonic acids as mentioned above depends on the degree of incorporation into the cells to be injured, and the degree of inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase. However, since bisphosphonic acids clinically applicable at present have all been synthesized for the purpose of improving bone-related disease, synthesis and screening of the compounds was performed using the affinity to bone, which is the action site of osteoclast, and cytotoxicity to osteoclast as indices. However, in the development of medicaments against tumor and virus infection, high bone penetration is conversely a factor that decreases reachability to tumor cells and virus infected cells.
Therefore, when direct improvement of cytotoxicity is desired, a decrease in the bone penetration needs to be one goal. On the other hand, when improvement of activation of γδ T cell as an immunity effector is desired, it is necessary to develop drugs by using, as indices, uptake into monocyte cells to be antigen presenting cells and γδ T cells activation potency. Thus, for compound screening without using suppression of bone resorption as an index, systematic synthesis of bisphosphonic acid having a basic skeleton different from that of conventional bisphosphonic acid is necessary.
About 30% of the low molecular medicaments currently on the market have fluorine in the basic skeleton. The reason for the superiority of medicaments due to the presence of a fluorine atom has not been completely elucidated. Until now, however, in the developmental stage of bisphosphonic acid, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid is only one in which the hydroxyl group bonded to C in the P-C-P skeleton of risedronic acid is substituted by fluorine. This is because introduction of a fluorine atom is synthetically difficult in bisphosphonic acids. Therefore, it is an important research progress in the development of a medicament of bisphosphonic acid to explore a synthetic pathway of a series of fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivatives, synthesize them systematically and study their physiological activities.

Effect of the Invention
When the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is reacted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cultured together with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 11 days, not less than 90% of the total cells become Vδ2 positive γδ T cells. The Vδ2 positive γδ T cells induced to proliferate show a cell-injuring activity on various tumor cells and virus infected cells. Furthermore, when tumor cells and virus infected cells are reacted with the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention, the recognition ability of Vδ2 positive γδ T cells is enhanced and the cells become more prone to cytotoxicity. That is, tumor cells and virus infected cells are immunized, and easily injured by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells. Utilizing this property, a novel immunotherapy of cancer and virus infection disease becomes possible.
When the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is reacted with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, it is selectively incorporated into monocytes having high liquid phase endocytosis ability. The fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid directly inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative undergoes hydrolysis of the ester, is converted to bisphosphonic acid and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Due to the inhibitory action, isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite located directly upstream of the enzyme, is intracellularly accumulated. Isopentenyl diphosphate binds to an intracellular region of the butyrophilin 3A1 molecule present in the cellular membrane, and changes the conformation of the extracellular region or changes the degree of polymerization. The change is recognized by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and proliferation stimulation is produced. When a cell proliferation factor such as IL-2, IL-15 and the like acts thereon, γδ T cells proliferate markedly. The proliferated γδ T cells show high tumor cell toxicity, and high virus infected cell toxicity.
When the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is reacted with tumor cells and virus infected cells, these medicaments are incorporated into the cells, and a phenomenon similar to the changes in the monocytes occurs. That is, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid directly inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonate ester derivative undergoes hydrolysis of the ester, is converted to bisphosphonic acid and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Due to the inhibitory action, isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite located directly upstream of the enzyme, is intracellularly accumulated. Isopentenyl diphosphate binds to an intracellular region of the butyrophilin 3A1 molecule present in the cellular membrane, and changes the conformation of the extracellular region or changes the degree of polymerization. The change is recognized by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and tumor cells and virus infected cells are efficiently injured.
Utilizing these actions of the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention, a novel immunotherapy of cancer and virus infection can be established. This therapy roughly includes two methods. One is an adoptive immunotherapy, and the other is a direct administration method.
In adoptive immunotherapy, mononuclear cells are purified from the peripheral blood of cancer patients or virus infection patients, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is added, IL-2 is further added, and the cells are cultured for 11 days, whereby not less than 90% of the total cells become Vδ2 positive γδ T cells and the proliferation rate becomes not less than 1000-fold. This cell standard product is washed with PBS and intravenously administered to patients. In this case, when the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is administered before administration the cell, cancer cells or virus infected cells are immunized and the sensitivity to γδ T cells increases.
In the direct administration method, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is intravenously administered to cancer patients or virus infection patients. In this case, a part of the compound is incorporated into the monocyte by liquid phase endocytosis, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid directly inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative undergoes hydrolysis of the ester, is converted to bisphosphonic acid and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Due to the inhibitory action, isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite located directly upstream of the enzyme, is intracellularly accumulated, binds to an intracellular region of the butyrophilin 3A1 molecule present in the cellular membrane, and changes the conformation of the extracellular region or changes the degree of polymerization. The change is recognized by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and proliferation stimulation occurs. On the other hand, the remaining compound is incorporated into the tumor cells or virus infected cells, induces an action similar to that in the monocyte and promotes sensitivity to γδ T cells. In this way, proliferated γδ T cells efficiently injure tumor cells or virus infected cells and induce antitumor activity and/or antivirus activity.
As mentioned above, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention induces proliferation of γδ T cell, which is one kind of immunocyte, and promotes sensitivity of tumor cells and/or virus infected cells to γδ T cells, and therefore, it is utilizable as a low molecule medicament for an antitumor immune cell therapy and an anti viral infection immune therapy.

The fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention can be efficiently produced by 3 synthesis steps when, for example, a fluorine atom is introduced into bisphosphonic acid (or a derivative thereof).

Alternatively, when bisphosphonic acid (or a derivative thereof) into which a fluorine atom is introduced is obtainable, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention can also be produced by using the compound as a starting material and introducing a desired substituent. The reagent to be used, reaction conditions and the like can be selected and determined by a known method or by appropriately modifying or altering the method according to the kind of the starting material and substituent to be introduced.
The fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention can be specifically synthesized according to the synthesis procedure of the below-mentioned Examples.
The fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative in the present invention may be pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In addition, when the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention contain an isomer (e.g., optical isomer, geometric isomer and tautomer) and the like, the present invention encompasses such isomers and also encompasses solvate, hydrate and various shapes of crystals.
In the present invention, as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, general salts pharmacologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be mentioned. Specific examples of such salt include the following.
Examples of basic addition salt include alkali metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt and the like; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salt, magnesium salt and the like; ammonium salt; trimethylamine salt, triethylamine salt; aliphaticamine salts such as dicyclohexylamine salt, ethanolamine salt, diethanolamine salt, triethanolamine salt, procaine salt and the like; aralkylamine salts such as N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine and the like; heterocycle aromatic amine salts such as pyridine salt, picoline salt, quinoline salt, isoquinoline salt and the like; quaternary ammonium salts such as tetramethylammonium salt, tetraethylammonium salt, benzyltrimethylammonium salt, benzyltriethylammonium salt, benzyltributylammonium salt, methyltrioctylammonium salt, tetrabutylammonium salt and the like; basic amino acid salts such as arginine salt, lysine salt and the like; and the like.

The novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention have a farnesyl diphosphate synthase inhibitory activity. As a result, it suppresses production of isoprenoid metabolites such as cholesterol, liposoluble vitamin, lipoprotein and the like, which are essential for cell survival and exhibits superior direct tumor damaging effect and virus-infected cell cytotoxicity effect. Therefore, the present invention provides direct or indirect antitumor drugs and antiviral agents containing the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and/or a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative as an active ingredient.
The antitumor and antiviral agent of the present invention can be used by administering to the living body, and preferably administered to mammals (human, mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, cat, dog, bovine, sheep, monkey etc.).
The novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention specifically stimulates and proliferates and/or induces Vδ2 positive γδ T cells present in the blood such as peripheral blood in the living body, or lymph fluid, as well as can induce or potentiate an antitumor action of these cells. Therefore, the present invention provides lymphocyte-treating agent containing the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and/or a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative as an active ingredient.
As an antitumor action of the γδ T cells, recognition of a molecule expressing in cancer cells, for example, MICA/B and IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate) via a T cell receptor thereof and injury of the cell by γδ T cells can be mentioned. Furthermore, enhancement of antitumor activity by the action of cytokines such as TNF-α, INF-γ and the like produced by γδ T cells can be mentioned.
The lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention has an action to proliferate and/or induce γδ T cells in vivo and ex vivo. Therefore, the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention can be used by treating a sample containing γδ T cells collected from a living body, or directly administering to a living body. Here, the living body means mammals (human, mouse, rat, hamster, rabbit, cat, dog, bovine, sheep, monkey etc.), and human is particularly preferable.
The present invention also includes a method of suppressing proliferation of tumor cells, comprising a step of proliferating and/or inducing γδ T cells by reacting the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention on a sample containing γδ T cells collected from a living body, and a step of returning the γδ T cells to the living body.
As a sample containing γδ T cells collected from a living body, blood such as peripheral blood and lymph fluid can be recited as examples. As a target of the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention, peripheral blood is preferable, and it is more preferable to use a mononuclear cell fraction separated from the peripheral blood by a specific gravity centrifugation method.
It is possible to stimulate γδ T cells in a sample with the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention by culturing the lymphocyte-treating agent and the sample according to a conventional method. It is possible to induce and/or proliferate γδ T cells by culturing in the presence of a fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and/or a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative in a trace amount of 100 pM-100 μM, preferably 100 pM-20 μM, further preferably 100 pM-5 μM.
Since the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative as the active ingredient in the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention has a bisphosphonic acid skeleton, it shows resistance to alkaliphosphatase as compared to conventional pyrrophosphoric acid lymphocyte-treating agents (Biology Trace Element Research, 104, 131-140 (2005)). Therefore, as a culture medium of γδ T cells to induce and/or proliferate γδ T cells, one containing a serum can be used and, for example, human AB serum, fetal bovine serum and the like can be used. Since a medium containing a serum can be used, γδ T cells can be advantageously provided in an amount sufficient for use in a cancer treatment, conveniently and in a short time.
As a constitution embodiment for use of the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention ex vivo for proliferating and/or inducing γδ T cells, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and/or a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative itself as the active ingredient may be used alone. In addition, it can also be produced as a solution of ethanol, DMSO and the like. Where necessary, other additive can also be added simultaneously. When the lymphocyte-treating agent is reacted with a sample, interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-7 (IL-7), interleukin-15 (IL-15), interleukin-18 (IL-18), and the like may also be added as an aid factor at a concentration of 0.1-150 IU/mL, preferably 1-100 IU/mL or 0.11-1000 ng/mL. Specific induction and/or proliferation of the γδ T cells becomes remarkable by the addition of these.
Induction and/or proliferation of specific γδ T cells by the lymphocyte-treating agent can be evaluated by measuring, after culturing, the IFN-γ amount and/or TNF-α amount produced in the culture supernatant. For example, when the TNF-α production amount is higher than that at the time of start of culture, γδ T cells can be judged to have been induced. The IFN-γ amount and/or TNF-α amount can be performed using a conventionally-known method by using an anti-IFN-γ antibody, an anti-TNF-α antibody and the like.
The γδ T cells treated with the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention as mentioned above can be used by administration as a medicament to a patient. For example, a mononuclear cell fraction derived from a patient having a tumor is treated with the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention, and a mononuclear cell fraction found to show proliferation and/or induction of γδ T cells is administered as peripheral blood and the like to allow for exhibition of an antitumor activity. As an administration method, methods such as topical injection, intravenous injection, transdermal absorption and the like.
When the antitumor drug, antiviral agent and lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention are used as pharmaceutical products, they are generally mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, diluent, filler, disintegrant, stabilizer, preservative, buffering agent, aromatic, colorant, sweetening agent, thickener, corrigent, solubilizing agents, and other additive known per se, specifically, water, vegetable oil, alcohol (e.g., ethanol, benzyl alcohol etc.), polyethylene glycol, glyceroltriacetate, gelatin, hydrocarbonate (e.g., lactose, starch etc.), magnesium stearate, talc, lanolin, petrolatum and the like, and a tablet, pill, powder, granule, suppository, injection, eye drop, liquid, capsule, troche, aerosol, elixir, suspension, emulsion, syrup and the like are formed by conventional methods, and they can be administered systemically or topically, orally or parenterally.
While the dose varies depending on the age, body weight, symptom, treatment effect, administration method and the like, it is generally 0.001 mg/kg-1000 mg/kg, preferably 0.01 mg/kg-100 mg/kg, per one time in the amount of active ingredient, for an adult, which is administered once to several times per day, orally or in the form of injection such as intravenous injection and the like.
The present invention encompasses direct and indirect antitumor drug and antiviral agent, and shows a treatment effect on benign and malignant tumor, and virus infected cells. In addition, the lymphocyte-treating agent of the present invention is useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of tumor. Examples of the tumor target include malignant tumors such as brain tumor (malignant astrocytoma, glioma having oligodendroglial tumor component etc.), esophagus cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, large intestine cancer (colorectal cancer, rectal cancer etc.), urinary bladder cancer, lung cancer (non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, primary and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma etc.), renal cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, neuroblastoma, sarcoma, bone and soft tissue tumor, bone tumor, osteosarcoma, testis tumor, extragonadal tumor, orchis tumor, uterine cancer (uterus cervix cancer, uterine body cancer etc.), head and neck tumor (maxilla cancer, laryngeal cancer, pharyngeal cancer, cancer of the tongue, mouth cavity cancer etc.), multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma (reticulum cell sarcoma, lymphosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease etc.), polycythemia vera, leukemia (acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia etc.), thyroid cancer, renal pelvis cancer, ureter tumor, bladder tumor, gall bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, pediatric tumor (Ewing sarcoma family, Wilms' tumor, rhabdomyosarcoma, blood vessel sarcoma, testicular embryonal carcinoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, hepatoblastoma, nephroblastoma etc.) and the like and the like. As viral infectious disease to be the target, viral infectious disease such as HTLV-1 infections, HIV infections, influenza disease, herpes disease and the like, and the like can be mentioned. In the present invention, application to urinary bladder cancer, renal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, hematologic tumor such as leukemia and the like, and HTLV-1 infections is preferable.

This was centrifuged at 600×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The medium, ZOLF 1 mM solution or ZOLF-POM 1 μM solution was added by 1 mL to the cell pellets after removal of the supernatant and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hr 45 min. Thereto was added 10 mM lanthanoid metal chelating agent by 2.5 μL, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min. These conical tubes were centrifuged at 600×g for 5 min, and the cell pellets were washed 3 times with RPMI1640 medium. Then, the cell pellets were suspended in 5 mL of RPMI1640 medium, 2 mL therefrom was placed in a different conical tube, and 6 mL of RPMI1640 medium was further added. The cell suspension was seeded by 100 μL in a 96 well round bottom plate. Vδ2 positive γδ T cells derived from adult T cell leukemia patients (4) were reacted at an effector cell/target cell ratio of 1.25:1, 2.5:1, 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 40:1, 80:1, and incubated for 40 min at 37° C. The plate was centrifuged at 600×g for 2 min, 25 μL of culture supernatant was taken, and diluted with 200 μL of europium-added acetate buffer. The mixture was taken by 200 μL, and time-resolved fluorescence was measured. The specific cytotoxicity rate was determined from the value of each sample, and the effector cell/target cell ratio dependency was graphically shown in FIG. 17. From the results, it was clarified that the sensitivity to a cytotoxicity activity of Vδ2 positive γδ T cells is promoted by reacting adult T cell leukemia cell line HCT-5 with at least 1 mM ZOLF or 1 μM ZOLF-POM.

INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
The novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention becomes a superior Vδ2 positive γδ T cell activator when it is reacted with the peripheral blood. When it is reacted with tumor cells or virus infected cells, it promotes sensitivity to a cytotoxicity action of Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and functions as an antitumor or antiviral agent. From these findings, antitumor immunotherapy and antiviral infection treating method using the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and/or a fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention can be established. Specifically, peripheral blood mononuclear cells of cancer patients or virus infection patients are prepared, and cultured ex vivo in the presence of the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention and IL-2 to induce proliferation of Vδ2 positive γδ T cells. The cells are intravenously or topically administered to the patients, whereby immunotherapy of cancer and virus infection, which utilizes Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, becomes possible. In addition, immunotherapy of cancer and virus infection, which utilizes Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, becomes possible by directly administering the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention to cancer patients or virus infection patients. In this case, the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is incorporated into monocyte cells, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid directly inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative undergoes hydrolysis of the ester, is converted to fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Due to the inhibitory action, isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite located directly upstream of the enzyme, is intracellularly accumulated. Isopentenyl diphosphate binds to an intracellular region of the butyrophilin 3A1 molecule present in the cellular membrane, and changes the conformation of the extracellular region or changes the degree of polymerization. The change is recognized by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and proliferation stimulation is produced. The proliferated γδ T cells show high tumor cytotoxicity, and high virus infected cell toxicity. On the other hand, the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention is incorporated into tumor cells and virus infected cells, during which a phenomenon similar to the changes in the monocytes occurs. That is, the fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid directly inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase, and the fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative undergoes hydrolysis of the ester, is converted to the form of an acid and inhibits farnesyl diphosphate synthase. Due to the inhibitory action, isopentenyl diphosphate, which is a metabolite located directly upstream of the enzyme, is intracellularly accumulated. Isopentenyl diphosphate binds to an intracellular region of the butyrophilin 3A1 molecule present in the cellular membrane, and changes the conformation of the extracellular region or changes the degree of polymerization. The change is recognized by Vδ2 positive γδ T cells, and tumor cells and virus infected cells are efficiently injured. In this way, antitumor immunotherapy and antiinfection immunotherapy using the novel fluorine-containing bisphosphonic acid or fluorine-containing bisphosphonate derivative of the present invention become possible.
The compound of the present invention in an oil form is superior in solubility and preferably administered as a medicament.
