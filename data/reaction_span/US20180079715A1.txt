TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel method for producing an alkylamine derivative and its novel production intermediate.
BACKGROUND ART
In recent years, by progression of research on diseases that are improved by the activation of CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor), such as diarrhea, peptic ulcer, hyperparathyroidism, and secondary hyperparathyroidism under maintenance dialysis, compounds having an effect of activating CaSR are expected for being applied to therapeutic agents or prophylactic agents. For example, it has been revealed that the CaSR agonist, Cinacalcet (CCT) has an effect of suppressing the secretion of parathyroid hormone by acting on CaSR in the parathyroid gland to increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of CaSR (Non Patent Literature 1), and is commercially available as a therapeutic drug against secondary hyperparathyroidism of dialysis patients (Non Patent Literature 2).
The applicant of the present invention has already filed patent applications for the inventions relating to alkylamine derivatives having CaSR agonist effects and being highly useful as therapeutic agents or prophylactic agents against diseases that are improved by the activation of CaSR (Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2).
Patent Literature 1 and Patent Literature 2 disclose a method shown in the following scheme as a general method for producing an alkylamine derivative having a urea bond included in general formula (I-c) (see Patent Literature 1 for symbols in the formula).
<img> id-US20180079715A1-20180322-C00002.TIF </img>
A urea derivative (I-c) can be produced by dissolving or suspending amine or a salt thereof of an alkylamine derivative represented by general formula (2c) and an amine derivative represented by general formula (3) in an appropriate solvent, mixing with a condensation agent such as CDI (carbonyldiimidazole), phosgene, and triphosgene, or a carbonyl source such as dimethyl carbonate in the presence or the absence of a base such as triethylamine and pyridine, and when necessary, followed by cooling, heating or the like of the reaction system.
However, processes disclosed in the examples of Patent Literature 1 or Patent Literature 2 are not suitable as industrial processes in terms of yield. Moreover, Patent Literature 1 discloses the production method that requires purification using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Therefore, whereas an alkylamine derivative can be expected as a therapeutic agent or a prophylactic agent useful against diseases that are improved by the activation of CaSR, a novel method capable of producing the alkylamine derivative in an industrially more efficient manner than that in conventional production methods has been desired.Patent Literature 1: International Publication No. WO2011/108690Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2013-63971Non Patent Literature 1: Current Opinion Pharmacology (2002), 2: 734-739Non Patent Literature 2: “REGPARA tablets (R)25 mg/REGPARA tablets (R) 75 mg” documents attached to medical drugs, Revised January 2010 <5th Edition>
