[TECHNICAL FIELD]
The present invention relates to a novel tricyclic compound having an antibacterial activity, its ester form or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a hydrate thereof.
[BACKGROUND ART]
Various β-lactam agents have been developed so far. Such β-lactam agents serve as clinically very important antibacterial agents. However, there are an increasing number of bacterial species that have acquired resistance to the β-lactam agents by producing β-lactamases, which degrade the β-lactam agents.
According to the molecular classification system of Ambler, the β-lactamases are broadly divided into four classes: class A (TEM type, SHV type, CTX-M type, KPC type etc.), class B (NDM type, IMP type, VIM type, L-1 type etc.), class C (AmpC type, ADC type etc.), and class D (OXA type etc.). Among them, the β-lactamases of classes A, C, and D are broadly divided into serine-β-lactamases, while the β-lactamases of class B are broadly divided into metallo-β-lactamases. These β-lactamases are known to hydrolyze the β-lactam agents by their respective different mechanisms.
In recent years, the presence of gram-negative bacteria highly resistant to many β-lactam agents including cephem and carbapenem by the production of serine-β-lactamases including extended-spectrum β-lactamases of class A (ESBLs) or class D as well as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), and metallo-β-lactamases of class B has been a clinical issue. Particularly, bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae producing KPC or metallo-β-lactamases are known to be highly resistant to carbapenem antibacterial agents, which are regarded as being important for the treatment of infection by gram-negative bacteria.
Patent Documents 2 and 3 report β-lactam compounds having a novel skeleton, but do not describe an antibacterial activity against the above carbapenem-resistant bacteria and the like, which have been in question in recent years. From the antibacterial activity described therein, it cannot be predictable that a compound group having the skeleton of the present invention has an antibacterial activity against carbapenem-resistant bacteria.

Test Example 6: Fluctuation Ames Test
Mutagenicity of the compound of the present invention was evaluated.
20 µL of freezing-stored rat typhoid bacillus (Salmonella typhimurium TA98 strain, TA100 strain) was inoculated on 10 mL of a liquid nutrient medium (2.5% Oxoid nutrient broth No.2), and this was cultured before shaking at 37°C for 10 hours. 9 mL of a bacterial solution of the TA98 strain was centrifuged (2000 × g, 10 minutes) to remove a culturing solution. The bacteria was suspended in 9 mL of a Micro F buffer (K2HPO4: 3.5 g/L, KH2PO4: 1 g/L, (NH4)2SO4: 1 g/L, trisodium citrate dehydrate: 0.25 g/L, MgSO4 • 7H2O: 0.1 g/L), the suspension was added to 110 mL of an Exposure medium (Micro F buffer containing Biotin: 8 µg/mL, histidine: 0.2 µg/mL, glucose: 8 mg/mL). The TA100 strain was added to 120 mL of the Exposure medium relative to 3.16 mL of the bacterial solution to prepare a test bacterial solution. Each 12 µL of DMSO solution of the compound of the present invention (several stage dilution from maximum dose 50 mg/mL at 2 to 3 fold ratio), DMSO as a negative control, and 50 µg/mL of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide DMSO solution for the TA98 strain, 0.25 µg/mL of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide DMSO solution for the TA100 strain under the non-metabolism activating condition, 40 µg/mL of 2-aminoanthracene DMSO solution for the TA98 strain, 20 µg/mL of 2-aminoanthracene DMSO solution for the TA100 strain under the metabolism activating condition as a positive control, and 588 µL of the test bacterial solution (a mixed solution of 498 µl of the test bacterial solution and 90 µL of S9 mix under the metabolism activating condition) were mixed, and this was shaking-cultured at 37°C for 90 minutes. 460 µL of the bacterial solution exposed to the compound of the present invention was mixed with 2300 µL of an Indicator medium (Micro F buffer containing biotin: 8 µg/mL, histidine: 0.2 µg/mL, glucose: 8 mg/mL, Bromo Cresol Purple: 37.5 µg/mL), each 50 µL was dispensed into microplate 48 wells/dose, and this was subjected to stationary culturing at 37°C for 3 days. Since a well containing a bacterium which had obtained the proliferation ability by mutation of an amino acid (histidine) synthesizing enzyme gene turns from purple to yellow due to a pH change, the bacterium proliferation well which had turned to yellow in 48 wells per dose was counted, and was assessed by comparing with a negative control group. (-) means that mutagenicity is negative and (+) is positive.
