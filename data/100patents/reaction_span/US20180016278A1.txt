INTRODUCTION
Given the low efficacy of a great majority of conventional anticancer agents in the treatment of cancers such as prostate cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, melanoma and lymphoma, research is directed toward new therapeutic strategies. Indeed, to succeed in overcoming the problems of resistances and of metastases, encountered more and more often in this type of disease, represents an important challenge for research.
Great hopes have been placed in immunotherapy, which contrary to other therapies makes it possible to treat the body as a whole and can eliminate the tumor cells disseminated throughout the body. Among the various immunotherapeutic approaches, the discovery of imiquimod (Aldara®), the first immunomodulating anticancer agent, effective notably against certain skin cancers such as melanoma, made it possible to take a step forward on this new pathway. Imiquimod is a nitrogen-containing tricyclic molecule of the imidazoquinoline family (WO 2006/070408, U.S. Pat. No. 4,689,338). It is known primarily for its antiviral activity against certain viruses such as herpes simplex II, Sendai virus and papilloma virus. The latest publications on this molecule also demonstrate substantial immunomodulatory antitumor activity on skin cancers such as basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and melanoma. More recent studies also showed efficacy against cutaneous metastases and vascular tumors. Imiquimod is thus the first of a new class of anticancer drugs called innate and acquired immune response modifiers, the mechanism of action of which differs from all known anticancer agents, e.g. nitrogen mustard, nitrosourea, alkylating agents, organoplatinum, etc.
However, a certain number of documents of the prior art disclose other quinoxaline derivatives for various therapeutic applications.
Hence, Deleuze-Masquéfa et al. (Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 12, 1129-1139, 2004) describe imidazo[1,2-a]quinoxaline derivatives as phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitors. Unlike imiquimod, these molecules inhibit the production and the effects of TNF-α in vitro and thus they seem to have a mode of action different from imiquimod. These derivatives may be of interest for their anti-inflammatory properties (Mojaria et al. International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology, 19, 2, 77-90, 2006). Anticancer activity, and a fortiori activity on melanomas or lymphomas, is neither described nor suggested in these documents. Indeed, it is described that the cytoprotective properties of the compounds cannot be correlated with their (IPDE4 activity. The compounds would act by activating the p38MAPK pathway and inhibiting the P13K pathway. They would thus inhibit TNF-αaction and production, making these drugs potential anti-inflammatory compounds. The effect of the compounds concerns protection from cell death induced by TNF-α on immune cells, which does not make it possible to envisage a priori the effects of the compounds concerning their direct cytotoxic activity on cancer cells.
Bonnard et al. (RICT 2005, Paris) describe the synthesis and the evaluation for their antitumor activity of imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxaline derivatives. The structure of the compounds tested is however not described.
US 2003/0022898 describes derivatives also having antiinflammatory activity, including a 4(2'aminoethyl)-amino-1,8dimethylimidazo(1,2-α)quinoxaline compound. This compound is also described as having antimelanoma activity in the document US 2006/0025419.
Colotta et al. (Eur. J. Med. Chem, 30, 133-139, 1995) describe various compounds, including imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxalines. Triazoloquinoxalines are described as binding to the adenosine receptor. Particular applications of imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxalines are not described.
Catarzi et al. (J. Med. Chem., 37, 2846-2850, 1994) describe triazoloquinoxalines and imidazoquinoxalines binding to the benzodiazepine receptor. The molecules binding to the benzodiazepine receptor are generally recognized for their anxiolytic activities. This document does not describe applications to cancer.
WO 93/04066 describes imidazoquinoxalinol compounds binding specifically to GABAa receptors. Only therapeutic uses as sedatives, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, etc., are envisaged. Applications in other therapeutic fields, in particular for the treatment of cancers, are neither described nor suggested by this document.
Zurbonsen et al. (European Journal of Pharmacology, 320, 215-221, 1997 and Biochemical Pharmacology, 54, 365-371, 1997) describe imidazo[1,2-α]pyrazine derivatives that have inhibitory activity on phosphodiesterases and are capable of inducing apoptosis in a leukemia cell line. It should be noted, however, that not all phosphodiesterase inhibitors have anticancer activity. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention are distinguished by high activity demonstrated in in vitro and in vivo tests on both lymphoma and melanoma.
WO 2007/109813 relates to imidazoquinoxalines having immunomodulatory activity. Only applications in the field of adjuvants and vaccines are described. This document envisages potential applications in many therapeutic fields, including cancer, but no in vitro or in vivo data confirms any anticancer activity.
WO 2007/087250 describes 5-lipoxygenase (LO) inhibitors. Applications in the field of cancer are not described.
The first imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxalines forming the subjectmatter of FR 2,921,927 (equivalent to WO 2009/043934 filed one year later) have an advantageous activity, novel and unexpected in 2007, on various cancers such as melanoma and T-cell lymphoma. The activities measured on various cell lines representative of these cancers show activities (IC50) of the micromolar order. Thus, direct cytotoxic activity with IC50 values of the micromolar order was demonstrated in vitro on various human tumor cell lines for the compounds disclosed in this patent application: melanoma, breast, colon, B lymphoma and adult T-cell leukemias/lymphomas (ATL) (Table 1) (Moarbess et al.), Bioorg. Med. Chem. 16, 6601-6610, 2008).
Several results concerning the in vivo anticancer activity of molecules derived directly from FR 2,921,927 have been published (Moarbess et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 16, 6601-6610, 2008; Khier et al., J. Separation Sci. 2009, 32, 1363-1373; Khier et al., Drug Metab Dispos 2010, 38(10), 1836-1847; Khier et al., Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2010, 39(1-3):23-29; Lafaille et al., Anal Chem. 2012, 84(22):9865-72; Lafaille F. et al., J. Pharm. Biomed. Anal. 2014, 88, 429-440).
Furthermore, a major problem posed by the development of anticancer agents relates to their toxicity, linked to their lack of specificity. Indeed, many anticancer agents act by disrupting general physiological cellular mechanisms such as inhibition of tubulin, for example. Tubulin is indeed present in all cells and is essential to the cell multiplication process, whether physiological or pathological, in the case for example of cancers. Alteration of the physiological processes involved in cell multiplication can generate notable side effects and should be avoided. Indeed, the first imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxalines synthesized have this deleterious effect of tubulin inhibition.
Thus, studies of inhibition of tubulin polymerization on purified tubulin fractions showed powerful inhibition by certain compounds disclosed in FR 2,921,927 (Gattacceca et al., Faseb J., 2013, 27, Ib584; Saliba et al., AntiCancer Drugs, 2014, 25, 624-632.).
However, the compounds of the present invention have an efficacy of a completely different level than the first imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxaline derivatives specifically described in FR 2,921,927, with IC50values on the order of 10 or so nanomoles, indeed nanomolar for some. Moreover, these new molecules no longer have a significant effect on tubulin. The molecules according to the present invention, in fact, make it possible to leave tubulin polymerization unaltered and thus to avoid the side effects associated therewith. Indeed, since microtubule activity may also be blocked in the case of compounds that inhibit tubulin polymerization, any other cellular activity requiring it, such as intraneuronal axonal transport, phagocytosis or leukocyte chemotaxis, for example, will also be inhibited. Moreover, the compounds of the present invention have shown significant activity on tumors tested in vitro. These effects are thus quite surprising and make it possible to envisage new therapies, particularly anticancer therapies.
The novel properties appear linked to a family of molecules having precise characteristics in terms of groups on the aromatic phenyl ring attached at the 1- or 2- position of the imidazol of the imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxaline heterocycle.
Thus, to remedy the disadvantages of the state of the art, the present invention proposes novel imidazo[1,2-α]quinoxaline derivative compounds for the treatment of cancers without specific distinction of the location of the tumor or tumors. These compounds may be used for the preparation of medicinal products for treating cancers.

Definitions By “halogen” is meant in particular according to the present invention the following halogens: F, CI, Br and I.
By “alkyl” is meant in particular according to the present invention linear or branched alkyl radicals, in particular C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 or C6 alkyl radicals, when the length of the chain is not specified, in particular methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl or t-butyl radicals. This definition also applies to the alkyl moieties of cycloalkyl, alkoxy, acyl, aralkyl, alkylamino or thioalkyl radicals. Thus, by “C1-C4 dialkylamino” is meant that two C1-C4 alkyl groups are bound to the same amine. When the stereochemistry of an alkyl group is not specified (e.g. aminopropylamine), preferably it is a linear alkyl (“n-alkyl”, i.e., amino-(n-propyl)amine) in the preceding specific case).
By “alkenyl” is preferably meant according to the invention a monovalent, unsaturated hydrocarbon chain containing at least one double bond, linear or branched, having 2 to 6 carbon atoms when the length of the chain is not specified, the representative elements of which are, for example, vinyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, isoprenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl groups.
By “cycloalkyl” is advantageously meant according to the invention C3-C2 cycloalkyls when the number of carbons contained in the ring is not specified, more particularly cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl radicals.
By “aryl” is preferably meant according to the invention one or more aromatic rings having 6 to 10 carbon atoms when the number of carbons contained in the ring is not specified, which may be coupled or fused, in particular phenyl. This definition also applies to the aryl moiety of aralkyl radicals. The aralkyl group is preferably (CH2)m-phenyl, wherein m is between 0 and 4.
By “amino” or “amine” is meant a primary, secondary or tertiary amine, preferably -NH2 or -NH3+if it is a salt.
By “methylamino” or “alkylamino” is meant -NH-CH3 or -NH-alkyl radicals.
By “aminoalkylamino” is meant -NH-alkyl-NH2 radicals.
By “heterocycle” is advantageously meant according to the invention a C3-C7 ring, when the number of carbons contained in the ring is not specified, containing at least one heteroatom selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, in particular the heterocycles are selected from thienyl, furyl, quinolinyl, indolyl, pyrazole, pyrrole, pyridine, pyrimidine, imidazole.
By “cancer” is meant all malignant neoplastic formations, whatever the histological nature. Malignant tumors are divided into two main categories: carcinomas, of epithelial origin, and sarcomas, of conjunctive origin. Malignant tumors are made of atypical cells, invasive or disseminating, generally characterized by the ability to grow autonomously, an imprecise definition, an ability to invade nearby tissues and vessels and a tendency to disseminate by producing metastases. Notable cancers include cancers of the breast, prostate, pancreas, lungs, esophagus, skin, bladder, stomach, liver, uterus, colon and rectum.
By “solid cancer” is meant cancers having carcinoma or sarcomatype tumors. These cancers develop in any tissue.
By “liquid cancer” is meant leukemia or lymphomatype cancers. Leukemias are cancers of the blood and bone marrow, whereas lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system. These blood cancers thus result from a tumoral proliferation of blood cells. There thus exist acute and chronic leukemias of lymphatic system cancers (lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma). For example, leukemia appears when immature (precursor) blood cells (such as lymphocytes or leukocytes) become cancerous and unable to mature further or to specialize normally.
By “metastatic cancer” or “disseminated cancer” is meant tumors that produce migrating cancer cells through the body, via blood or lymphatic vessels, and that have colonized at least one other tissue (and thus are able to generate at least one new tumor).
By “secondary cancer” is meant cancers resulting from an anticancer treatment that is believed to be therapeutic.
By “melanoma” is meant a malignant tumor that develops at the expense of pigmented tissues, more especially those of the skin or eye.
By “lymphoma” is meant any tumor, generally malignant, due to proliferation of lymphoid tissue cells, developing especially in the spleen or ganglia.
By “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is preferably meant according to the invention a salt of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid, i.e., with any nontoxic acid, including organic and inorganic acids.

General Synthesis of Imidazo[1,2-a]quinoxaline Compounds
Imidazoquinoxaline derivatives unsubstituted at the 1-position are synthesized according to a synthesis strategy described previously (Moarbess et al. 2008 Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 16, 6601-6610; Masquefa et al. 2009 European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 44, 3406-3411). The advantage of this synthesis scheme is direct production of imidazoquinoxaline-structured compounds with no intermediate or final purification. This synthesis strategy makes it possible to obtain the compound 3 with good yields and sufficient purity to continue the synthesis (scheme 1). The production of derivatives substituted at the 4-position by a chlorine atom or an amine function may benefit from microwave assistance, although conventional heating is always an option. The use of microwaves makes it possible to decrease reaction times and to optimize reaction yields. The Suzukitype crosscoupling reaction may also be carried out under microwave assistance and makes it possible to obtain a great diversity of new derivatives substituted at the 1position of the heterocycle. The retrosynthesis scheme 1 illustrates the cyclization method preferably used to obtain a carbonylimidazol dimer 1 by bimolecular condensation of 2imidazol carboxylic acid. The carbonylimidazol dimer 1 is coupled to an orthofluoroaniline to give an intermediate 2, which is then cyclized to provide the tricyclic compounds 3. Chlorinated compounds are obtained by reaction of phosphorus oxychloride in the presence of N,N-diethylaniline in a sealed flask under microwave assistance then purified by liquid chromatography on silica gel column.

Schema 1. Retrosynthesis of intermediate chlorinated imidazoquinoxaline compounds.
The chlorine atom at the 4-position is substituted by a suitable group (R3). The compounds thus substituted at the 4-position of the heterocycle are treated with N-bromosuccinimide under microwave assistance to obtain the new derivatives substituted at the 1- or 2- position by a bromine atom.

Schema 2: Synthesis of imiqualine derivatives: a) EtOH, ammonia or suitable amine, MW (150° C., 20 min); (b) NBS, CHCI3, reflux, 1 h30 min; c) suitable arylboronic acid ([Ph(Ra,Rb,Rc)]-B(OH)2), Pd(PPh3)4, Na2CO3, DME/H2O (2/1), MW (140° C., 20 min); d) BBr3, CH2Cl2, 1 h30 min, RT.
The arylboronic acids are coupled by Suzuki reaction under palladium catalysis with the brominated imidazoquinoxaline derivatives at the 1- or 2- position to obtain the substituted aryl compounds with good yields. If methoxylated aryl compounds are used for this coupling step, demethylation can be used to regenerate the phenol functions under the action of boron tribromide.

Procedure for addition of an amine function of an aamino acid.
4Chloroimidazo[1,2a]quinoxaline, amino acid (4 eq.) and diisopropylethylamine (4 eq.) are solubilized in dimethylformamide (12mL) in a vial suitable for microwaveassisted reactions and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The mixture is sealed and then homogenized ultrasonically before being placed under microwaves for 20 min at 150° C. The power delivered is adjusted automatically to about 45 watts. The dimethylformamide is evaporated under reduced pressure. The reaction medium is taken up in ethyl acetate, washed with saturated ammonium chloride solution, then with distilled water, and finally with saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude reaction product is purified by column chromatography on silica gel in order to obtain the expected addition compound.

General procedure for the deprotection reaction The protected compound is solubilized in dichloromethane. Under inert atmosphere at 0° C. and vigorous stirring, boron tribromide is added (2 eq. per function to be deprotected). Once the addition is finished, the reaction medium is stirred for 1h30m at room temperature. It is then hydrolyzed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution at 0° C. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with dichloromethane, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude reaction product is purified by chromatography on silica column to provide the expected products.

The EC50 values (concentration causing 50% inhibition of the specific activity of the control) are determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the inhibition curve produced by the average of the replicated values (use of a sigmoidal doseresponse curve with the Hill slope as variable and the constant values of 0.0 for the base and 100.0 for the peak as constraints). The analysis is carried out by using the GraphPad PRISM 5.0 software.
Materials and methods Day 1: the cells are seeded one day before treatment with the compounds in 96well plates. Cell suspensions for each cancer cell line are prepared with a specific density in a specific culture medium (see preceding table). Next, 1004 of cell suspension is distributed per well (1 x 96well plate per cell line).
Day 2: 24 hours later, the negative compounds or controls (DMSO) are added to the cells (1004 of a compound solution in its specific medium with a final DMSO concentration of 0.15%). Each compound concentration is tested in triplicate (6 concentrations between 10' M and 10' M per compound). The cells are incubated at 37° C. for 72 hours with no new treatment. Day 5: 15 minutes before incubation of the cells with MTT (3[4,5dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide), 10% SDS is added to the control wells to obtain a final concentration of 1%. The positive control of inhibition of proliferation is 1% SDS. Once the medium is removed, 1004 of a solution of MTT in fresh medium is added to each well (104 of 10X MTT solution at 5mg/mL in PBS +904 of fresh medium) and the plates are incubated for 4 hours at 37° C.
The MTT reaction is quenched and the medium is homogenized by addition of 1004 of 10% SDS/0.01 M HCl solution placed in each well. The medium is incubated for 2 hours at 37° C. before measuring its absorbance. Absorbance is measured at 570nm.
Study of the effect of the compounds on the polymerization of purified tubulin. Tubulin is prepared from pig brain according to the purification process described by Williams and
Lee (1982). Tubulin polymerization is monitored by turbidimetry at 350nm with an MC2 spectrophotometer (Safas, Monaco) equipped with a heatjacketed cuvette holder. The reaction mixture was prepared at 0° C., and contains PEM buffer, 25% glycerol (v/v), 1 mM GTP, and 2.4p.M tubulin. The GTP and the tubulin are added at the last minute. Stock solutions of the tested compounds and of colchicine are prepared in DMSO at the desired concentration, and 14 of the compound solution is added to the reaction medium. The same volume of DMSO alone was used as a negative control. The final volume of the sample is 2004. The reaction is initiated by placing the cuvette in the cell compartment of the spectrophotometer thermostated at 37° C. Ice is added 45 minutes later to launch depolymerization in order to confirm the specificity of the signal.
