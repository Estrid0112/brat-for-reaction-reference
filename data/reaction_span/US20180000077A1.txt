TECHNICAL DOMAIN
Embodiments of the present invention relates to a bactericidal or bacteriostatic composition comprising an acetal or a long-chain alkyl hexitan ether, its use in the treatment or prevention of Gram-positive bacterial infections, its use as a hygiene or dermatological product for external use and a method for disinfecting surfaces.
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND
Antimicrobial compounds are defined as molecules that can inhibit or stop the growth of micro-organisms or kill them. In this context, they are commonly used to prevent or treat human and animal infections, and in the agrifood industry to prevent multiplication of pathogenic bacteria in food. Widespread use of antimicrobial compounds favors the emergence of resistant infectious agents. The spread of bacteria that has acquired resistance mechanisms for the most widely used antimicrobial compounds is a more and more alarming major public health problem (J. S. Bradley et al. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2007;7:68-78).
As an illustration, many strains resistant to antibiotics for the most pathogenic species of genus Staphylococcus, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, have been isolated. Staphylococcus infections represent a high percentage of serious infections. What is more, almost half of nosocomial infections are reportedly related to staphylococcus. Mention may be made of the many strains of Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Although they are less virulent than staphylococci in particular, an increasing number of multiresistant enterococcus strains and more recently epidemics of enterococci resistant to glycopeptides, the antibiotics of recourse for this bacterial family, have been identified.
Another antibioresistance phenomenon has been described that might not only be related to the excessive use of antibiotics, but to food storage methods. So for example it has been shown that Listeria monocytogenes is more resistant to antibiotics after having undergone osmotic stress, at a low temperature or in an acidic medium (Anas A. et al. (2015) Food Microbiology, Volume 46, April, Pages 154-160). That is, the human contamination comes from food. In addition, although it is relatively rare, human listeriosis is a serious infection with mortality estimated at 50%. Accordingly, the emergence of antibiotic resistance in L. monocytogenes that could be caused by modern storage or treatment methods for food constitutes a serious threat to public health.
Although several mechanisms are often involved simultaneously in antibiotic resistance, it is common to classify it into three categories: (a) lack of antibiotic penetration into the bacterium, (b) inactivation or excretion of the antibiotic by bacterial enzymatic systems and (c) lack of affinity between the bacterial target and the antibiotic. These three resistance mechanism categories have a structural component, i.e. the mechanisms used are dependent on the structure of the molecule concerned.
No process in the prior art can produce an isomeric mixture of biosourced compounds with low toxicity and low cost.
Nevertheless, biosourced compounds have been described. Accordingly, different compounds used as antimicrobials have been described, among which are fatty acids and their corresponding polyhydroxylated esters that are active against Gram-positive bacteria and having long aliphatic chains. As an indication, one of the most active antimicrobials is monolaurin, a glycerol monoester with a C12 aliphatic chain. Its trade name is LAURICIDIN®. This compound is used as a food additive to inhibit bacterial growth (E. Freese, C. W. Sheu, E. Gathers. Nature 1973, 241, 321-325; E. G. A. Verhaegh, D. L. Marshall, D.-H. Oh. Int. J. Food Microbiol.1996, 29, 403-410). The ester function of the monolaurin is sensitive to esterases, so this compound degrades quickly and has a short half-life.
Also described are antimicrobials derived from sugar considered as particularly attractive because of their biodegradability, their low toxicity and environmental impact.
Examples of antimicrobials derived from sugar are the esters derived from sugar that are also used industrially for antimicrobial applications because their raw materials and production costs remain relatively low. Mention may be made for example of sorbitan caprylate described in international patent application W02014/025413 in mixture with Hinokitiol in an antimicrobial formulation. According to this application, this formulation will inhibit or kill Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, fungi and/or yeast.
Also described is the use of disaccharide esters as antimicrobial agents in the food industry. Dodecanoyl sucrose is one of the most used. It is reportedly particularly active against L. monocytogenes (M Ferrer, I Soliveri, F. J. Plou, N. Lopez-Cortes, D. Reyes-Duarte, M Christensen, J. L. Copa-Patiño, A. Ballesteros, Enz. Microb. Tech., 2005, 36, 391-398). Nevertheless, it is also described as weakly inhibiting the growth of S. aureus, for hospital applications (J. D. Monk, L.R. Beuchat, A.K. Hathcox, I Appl. Microbiol., 1996, 81, 7-18). It reports that the sucrose ester presents properties that are bacteriostatic (stops bacterial growth) but not bactericidal (kills the bacteria).
In addition, the synthesis of sugar esters presents many drawbacks. First, in spite of the low production cost, synthesizing esters, more particularly for di- and trisaccharides, is problematic because of sugars' high functionality, which causes the formation of a mixture of mono-, di- and polyesters and the presence of a polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide (DMF) and pyridine, is generally necessary to better solubilize the highly polar reagents. However, these solvents are classed carcinogenic, mutagenic and reprotoxic (CMR) and their use must be avoided. To solve this problem, enzymatic synthesis was used but the need to use very dilute media in these conditions makes production limited.
Moreover, the ester functions on these compounds are easy for the esterases present in the cells to hydrolyze. The molecules released after this hydrolysis, i.e. the sugar and the fatty acid, have little or no antimicrobial properties (the fatty acid is slightly active). This causes instability that is responsible for reduced activity in these compounds.
SUMMARY
To produce an antibiotic composition having lower chances of allowing resistance to develop, a composition may be used containing a mixture of compounds having antibiotic activity but including structural differences that can reduce the chances of developing bacterial resistance, in particular, a composition comprising an isomeric mixture of compounds having antibiotic activity.
A new antibiotic composition has low toxicity and low environmental impact. A biodegradable composition that can be obtained in large quantities from renewable resources, at low cost to be perfectly accessible for industrial application but also as effective as non-biosourced antimicrobials.
To produce an antibiotic composition that is not prone to develop resistance comprising effective and stable antimicrobial agents, embodiments of the invention propose an alkyl acetal or a long-chain alkyl sorbitan alkyl ether having very good antimicrobial activity whether in its pure form or as a mixture of isomers, where such a product can be obtained in particular in conditions that are not costly while respecting the environment and not representing a hazard for topical applications or by ingestion.

According to the invention, a “hexitan” is obtained by dehydrating a hydrogenated hexose (or hexitol) such as a sorbitol or mannitol. Typically, the hexitan is chosen from sorbitan, arlitan or mannitan.

Such a sorbitan acetal may be obtained by methods known to the person skilled in the art such as direct acetalization, trans-acetalization for example. In addition, a sorbitan alkyl ether may be obtained by methods known to the person skilled in the art such as the Williamson ether synthesis, epoxide opening, alcohol condensation, alcohol telomerization, acetal reduction, direct or indirect reducing alkylation.
A method produces this derivative in the pure form or in the form of a mixture of isomers of monoethers or hexitan alkyl monoacetals; preferentially the isomers are positional isomers and/or diastereoisomers.
A bactericidal or bacteriostatic composition comprises a hexitan alkyl monoether or monoacetal or a mixture of isomers thereof, preferentially positional isomers, obtained by a process comprising the following steps:a) a dehydration of a hexitol to obtain a monoanhydrohexitol;b) an acetalization or trans-acetalization of the hexitol or monoanhydrohexitol obtained in a) by an aliphatic aldehyde containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms or the acetal thereof, typically byi. an aliphatic aldehyde containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms, by acetalization, orii. an aliphatic aldehyde derivative containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms, by trans-acetalization;c) optionally, catalytic hydrogenolysis of the hexitan alkyl acetal obtained in b) preferentially without an acid catalyst,d) recovery of a mixture of hexitan alkyl monoether isomers obtained in c) in which the alkyl group (R) comprises between 11 to 18 carbon atoms orrecovery of a mixture of hexitan alkyl monoacetal isomers obtained in b) in which the alkyl group (R) comprises between 11 to 18 carbon atoms, ande) optionally, purification of either of the mixtures obtained in d), in particular by chromatography.
A bactericidal or bacteriostatic composition comprises a sorbitan alkyl monoether or monoacetal or a mixture of isomers thereof, preferentially positional isomers, obtained by a process comprising the following steps:a) a dehydration of a sorbitol to obtain a monoanhydrosorbitol;b) an acetalization or trans-acetalization of the sorbitol or monoanhydrosorbitol obtained in a) by an aliphatic aldehyde containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms or the acetal thereof, typically byi. an aliphatic aldehyde containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms, by acetalization, orii. an aliphatic aldehyde derivative containing from 11 to 18 carbon atoms, by trans-acetalization;c) optionally, catalytic hydrogenolysis of the sorbitan alkyl acetal obtained in b) preferentially without an acid catalyst,d) recovery of a mixture of sorbitan alkyl monoether isomers obtained in c) in which the alkyl group (R) comprises between 11 to 18 carbon atoms orrecovery of a mixture of sorbitan alkyl monoacetal isomers obtained in b) in which the alkyl group (R) comprises between 11 to 18 carbon atoms, ande) optionally, purification of either of the mixtures obtained in d), in particular by chromatography.
Typically, the aliphatic aldehyde derivative may be a di-alkyl acetal of the corresponding aldehyde. Di-methyl acetals and di-ethyl acetals are preferred.
A “monoanhydrohexitol” or a “monoanhydrosorbitol” is obtained by dehydration, by the elimination of one or more molecules of water from a hexitol or sorbitol. A suitable example monoanhydrosorbitol may be 1,4-anhydro-D-sorbitol (1,4-arlitan or sorbitan); 1,5-anhydro-D-sorbitol (polygalitol) or 3,6-anhydro-D-sorbitol (3,6-sorbitan).
The preferred monoanhydrosorbitol is a derivative from the dehydration of sorbitol to form, for example, 1,4-sorbitan, 3,6-sorbitan or 2,5-sorbitan.
“Positional isomer” is understood to mean regioisomers, more particularly understood to mean isomers of hexitan alkyl monoethers or monoacetals and in particular of sorbitan in which the alkyl monoether or monoacetal group is positioned on a different hexitan carbon. Typically, the positional isomers of the sorbitan alkyl monoacetal are 2,3-O-; 3,5-O- or 5,6-O- sorbitan alkyl monoacetal. Isomers of sorbitan alkyl monoether are 2-O-, 3-O-, 5-O- or 6-O- sorbitan alkyl monoether.
The term “diastereoisomers” denotes optical isomers that are not superimposable, nor mirror images. Examples of sorbitan alkyl monoacetal diastereoisomers are:
According to an embodiment, the process according to the invention may comprise a hexitol dehydration step to obtain a monoanhydrohexitol. Typically, the sorbitol is melted before the dehydration step. The dehydration step may be conducted with a catalyst, for example with an acidic catalyst.
The dehydration step may be conducted under a hydrogen atmosphere at a pressure preferably of about 20 to 50 bar.
Advantageously, the dehydration step is conducted at a temperature comprised between 120 and 170° C., preferably between 130 and 140° C.
Typically, the sorbitol is purified after the dehydration step, for example by crystallization, recrystallization or chromatography.
The acetalization or trans-acetalization step may comprise:
i) optionally, a step of preheating sorbitol, preferably at a temperature comprised between 70 and 130° C., typically between 90 and 110° C.,
ii) a step of addition of the aliphatic aldehyde or an aliphatic aldehyde derivative of said sorbitol and
iii) a step of addition of a catalyst, preferably an acid catalyst.
Step i) is particularly advantageous in that it may be implemented in the absence of solvent.
Preferably, the acid catalyst used during the acetalization or trans-acetalization step and if need be the dehydration step may be a homogeneous or heterogeneous acid catalyst. The term “homogeneous”, as used in the expression “homogeneous acid catalyst”, refers to a catalyst that is in the same phase (solid, liquid or gas) or in the same aggregate state as the reagent. Conversely, the term “heterogeneous,” as used in the expression “heterogeneous acid catalyst”, refers to a catalyst that is in a different phase (solid, liquid or gas) as the reagents.
Said acid catalyst used during the acetalization or trans-acetalization step and if need be during the dehydration step may be independently chosen from solid or liquid, organic or inorganic acids, solid acids being preferred. Specifically, the preferred acid catalyst is chosen from para-toluene sulfonic acid, methane sulfonic acid, camphorsulfonic acid (CSA) and sulfonic resins.
Typically, the acetalization or trans-acetalization step is conducted at temperatures comprised between 70 and 130° C., typically between 70 and 90° C. The temperature of the reaction mixtures may vary as a function of the reagents and solvents used. The reaction time is determined by the degree of conversion reached.
According to an embodiment, the acetalization or trans-acetalization step may be conducted by an aliphatic aldehyde or the acetal thereof, typically a linear or branched aliphatic aldehyde or the acetal thereof. The acetalization or trans-acetalization step may be typically conducted with an aliphatic aldehyde or the acetal thereof having 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 carbon atoms, for example chosen from undecanal, dodecanal, tridecanal, tetradecanal, pentadecanal, hexadecanal, heptadecanal, octodecanal and the acetal. Preferably, the C11-C13 aliphatic aldehyde or the acetal thereof is a C12 aliphatic aldehyde or the acetal thereof, for example a dodecanal or the acetal thereof.
The expression “the acetal thereof” or “their acetal(s)” as used herein covers the di-alkyl acetal of the corresponding C11-C18 aliphatic aldehyde. More particularly, the di-methyl or di-ethyl acetals of the C11-C18 aliphatic aldehyde are preferred.
According to an embodiment, the acetalization or trans-acetalization step may be conducted with or without solvent. When the reaction is conducted in the presence of a solvent, the solvent is preferably a polar solvent.
Typically, the solvent may be chosen from dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylacetamide (DMA), acetonitrile (CH3CN), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2Me-THF), cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), propanol (PrOH), isopropanol (iPrOH), butanol (BuOH), dibutyl ether (DBE), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and trimethoxypropane (TMP).
In-depth experimental work led to a selection of conditions that allow observation of conversion rates and optimal yields during acetalization or trans-acetalization steps. Better results were obtained when the molar ratio [(C11-C18 aliphatic aldehyde or their acetal): monosaccharide] is between 5:1 and 1:5, preferably between 4:1 and 1:4, and advantageously between 3:1 and 1:3.
The inventors have more particularly shown that, during an acetalization reaction, the molar ratio of C11-C18 aliphatic aldehyde: monosaccharide comprised between 1:1 and 1:5, preferably between 1:1 and 1:4, and in a preferred manner between 1:3 and 1:2 improves the yields and conversion rates.
The inventors have additionally shown that, during trans-acetalization reactions, a molar ratio of C11-C18 aliphatic aldehyde: monosaccharide comprised between 1:1 and 5:1, preferably between 5:4 and 4:1, and preferably between 3:1 and 4:3, preferably between 3:2 and 2:5 improves the yields and conversion rates. The catalysts used are the same as those of the acetalization reaction.
Such a process may additionally comprise at least one neutralization and/or filtration and/or purification step after any one of the dehydration, if need be, acetalization or trans-acetalization steps.
When a purification step is provided, said purification step may be for example a crystallization, a recrystallization or a chromatography. Preferably, chromatography is conducted using a non-aqueous polar solvent. In general, when a filtration and/or purification step is provided before the hydrogenolysis step, the non-aqueous polar solvent may be the same as that used during the hydrogenolysis step.
Advantageously, the hydrogenolysis step is conducted at a temperature comprised between 80° C. and 140° C., and/or at a hydrogen pressure comprised between 15 and 50 bar, preferably between 20 and 40 bar.
The hydrogenolysis step is conducted advantageously in a polar aprotic solvent, preferably a non-aqueous solvent. In fact, aprotic solvents provide better conversion. Examples of aprotic solvents are, among others, without limitation, alkanes, 1,2,3-trimethoxypropane (TMP), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tetrahydrofuran (THF), 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran (2Me-THF), dibutyl ether (DBE) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME). Preferably, the aprotic solvent is CPME. Alkanes are advantageous because they allow better hydrogen solubilization in the medium. However, the conversion is lower than for other aprotic solvents such as CPME. Generally, among alkanes, dodecane and heptane are preferred.
The hydrogenolysis step is conducted preferably in a polar aprotic solvent at a temperature comprised between 80° C. and 140° C., and/or at a hydrogen pressure comprised between 15 and 50 bar, in the presence of a catalyst suitable for hydrogenolysis reactions.
Preferably, the hydrogenolysis step is conducted in a non-aqueous polar solvent at a temperature comprised between 100° C. and 130° C. and/or at a pressure comprised between 25 and 35 bar.
Generally, the hydrogenolysis is conducted in the presence of a suitable catalyst such as a catalyst containing precious metals or common metals. More particularly, the common metals may be iron or non-iron metals. Typically, hydrogenolysis is conducted in the presence of a catalyst containing iron metals.
As an indication, a metal catalyst belonging to the group of iron metals may be nickel, cobalt or iron.
Preferably, hydrogenolysis is conducted using a catalyst containing precious metals such as palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, platinum or iridium.
As a general rule, the catalyst used during hydrogenolysis may be fixed on a substrate such as carbon, alumina, zirconia or silica or any mixture of these. Such a substrate is for example a bead. Accordingly, a palladium catalyst fixed on carbon beads (Pd/C) may be advantageously used. These catalysts may be doped by adding precious metals or common metals. These are called doping agents. Typically, the doping agent represents 1 to 10% by weight of the catalyst.
Typically, the composition is bactericidal or bacteriostatic for Gram-positive bacteria.
Advantageously, the bactericidal or bacteriostatic composition is incorporated in a food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, phytosanitary, veterinary or surface treatment composition. Such as, for example, a cosmetic and/or dermatological composition for cleansing and/or treating skin, particularly in the form of a cream, a gel, a powder, a lotion, a butter in particular, a shower gel, soap, shampoo, shower bath, deodorant, antiperspirant, moist wipe, sun protection formulation or decorative cosmetic formulation.
A bactericidal or bacteriostatic composition as described may be used as a hygiene or dermatological product for external use.
Typically a “hygiene product” refers to any product used for cleansing, disinfection or hygiene, including for example a lotion, mousse, spray or liquid but also wipes or any substrate that can be impregnated with the composition according to the invention. The expression “dermatological product” refers to any product intended for application on the skin or mucous membranes.
Use in the Treatment or Prevention of a Gram-positive Bacterial Infection.
A composition as described may be used in the treatment or prevention of bacterial infections by Gram-positive bacteria.
“Treatment” is understood to mean curative treatment (aiming to at least reduce, eradicate or stop the development of the infection) in a patient. “Prevention” is understood to mean prophylactic treatment (aiming to reduce the risk of the infection appearing) in a patient.
The “patient” may be, for example, a human being or a non-human mammal (for example a rodent (mouse, rat), a feline, a dog or a primate) affected by or that could be affected by bacterial infections and in particular Gram-positive bacterial infections. Preferably, the subject is a human.
The expression “Gram-positive” refers to bacteria that are colored dark blue or purple by the Gram stain, by contrast with Gram-negative bacteria that cannot retain the purple stain. The Gram staining technique uses bacteria's membrane and wall characteristics.
Typically, the Gram-positive bacteria are bacteria from the phylum of Firmicutes, typically of the class of Bacilli in particular chosen from bacteria of the order of Lactobacillales or Bacillales.

A method for treatment or prevention of a bacterial infection by Gram-positive bacteria, preferentially an infection of the skin or mucous membranes, by administration, preferentially topical, to an individual who needs it, of a therapeutically effective quantity of the composition described.
In a person infected by a Gram-positive bacterium, “therapeutically effective quantity” is understood to mean sufficient quantity to prevent the infection from changing for the worse, or sufficient to make the infection regress. In a person who is not infected, the “therapeutically effective quantity” is the quantity that is sufficient to protect a person who would come into contact with a Gram-positive bacterium and prevent the occurrence of the infection caused by this Gram-positive bacterium.

Although having distinct meanings, the terms “comprising”, “containing”, “including” and “consisting of” have been used interchangeably in the description of the invention, and may be replaced by each other. The invention will be better understood upon reading the following figures and examples given only as examples.
EXAMPLES
The sorbitan acetals were prepared by acetalization or trans-acetalization of sugars following the procedure previously described in patent No. 13/01375 “Method for preparing long-chain alkyl cyclic acetals made from sugars.” The sugar acetals are then reduced using reduction conditions without an acid catalyst previously described in patent No. 14/01346. For indication, the synthesis of sorbitan acetals and ethers is described below.
Example 1
General Procedure for the Synthesis of Sorbitan Acetals (A)
Sorbitol Dehydration:
D-sorbitol (20 g, 110 mmol) and 0.1 mol % of camphorsulfonic acid are added to a 150-mL stainless-steel autoclave. The reactor is hermetically sealed, purged three times with hydrogen then hydrogen was introduced until the pressure reached 50 bar. The system is then heated to 140° C. and stirred with a mechanical stirrer for 15 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the hydrogen pressure was released and the crude reaction mixture was diluted in ethanol (200 mL) to produce a homogeneous yellow mixture. The solvent is evaporated under low pressure and the residue is then crystallized from cold methanol and filtered under vacuum. The crystalline material was washed with cold methanol to give 1,4-sorbitan (5.88 g, 35% of theory) in the form of a white solid. The purity is >98%, as determined by HPLC, while the crystals had a melting point of 113-114 ° C. The degree of reaction conversion was determined at 73%, by which a mixture of sorbitol, 1,4-sorbitan, isosorbide and a few by-products in very small quantities were obtained, such that the ratio of 1,4-sorbitan:isosorbide was determined as being 80: 20.
General Procedure for Sorbitan Acetalization
In a round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser and a CaCl2 trap, under an argon atmosphere, 1,4-D-sorbitan (5.00 g, 30.5 mmol, 3 equiv) is dissolved in dry ethanol (15 mL). The aldehyde (10.2 mmol, 1 equiv) is then added dropwise followed by the camphorsulfonic acid (CSA, 10% by mass relative to the aldehyde). The reaction mixture was held at 80° C. for 15 hours with magnetic stirring. The reaction mixture is cooled and the solvent is evaporated under low pressure. The residue is triturated in ethyl acetate and the excess sorbitan is removed by filtration and washed with cold ethyl acetate. This operation may be repeated to remove any traces of sorbitan. The filtrate was concentrated under low pressure. The residue is purified by chromatography on a silica gel column to give the sorbitan alkyl acetals. The composition of the mixture of regioisomers 5,6-O-alkylidene- and 3,5-O-alkylidene-1,4-D-sorbitan was determined by HPLC. In addition, each regioisomer was obtained in the form of a mixture of two diastereoisomers.
Procedure for Sorbitan Trans-acetalization:
In a round-bottomed flask, 1,4-sorbitan (0.5 g, 3 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (7.5 mL) and 1,1-diethoxypentane (1.15 mL, 6 mmol) was added under an argon flow, then camphorsulfonic acid (50 mg; 10% w/w). The reaction mixture is heated to 80° C. with magnetic stirring. After 3 hours, the mixture was neutralized and concentrated under low pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (ethyl acetate/cyclohexane 80:20 to 100:0) to give the sorbitan acetal (0.43 g, 66% isolated yield) in the form of a colorless oil. HPLC revealed a mixture of 4 isomers.
Example 1a
5,6-O-Pentylidene-1,4-D-sorbitan 1a and 1a' and 3,5-O-pentylidene-1,4-D-sorbitan 1a″ and 1a'″: The compounds were obtained from 1,4-D-sorbitan (0.49 g, 3 mmol) and valeraldehyde (0.107 mL, 1 mmol) according to the general procedure (A).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of a Sorbitan Ether (B)
In a 300-mL stainless-steel autoclave, the mixture of regioisomers and diastereoisomers of 1,4-D-sorbitan acetals (20 mmol) is diluted in cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME, 200 mL) and 5%-Pd/C (1.00 g, 5 mol % palladium) is added. The reactor is hermetically sealed, purged three times with hydrogen then hydrogen is introduced to a pressure of 30 bar. The reaction mixture is stirred mechanically and heated to 120° C. for 15 hours. After returning to ambient temperature, the hydrogen pressure is released and the reaction mixture is diluted in absolute ethanol (EtOH, 100 mL) and filtered (Millipore Durapore 0.01 p.m filter). The filtrate is concentrated under low pressure to give the mixture of sorbitan ether regioisomers.

One-pot Procedure for the Synthesis of a Sorbitan Ether
One pot Synthesis of Sorbitan Ethers from 1, 4-sorbitan:
In a 100-mL round-bottomed flask, 1,4-sorbitan (10 g, 62 mmol) is dissolved in dry CPME (30 mL) in the presence of Na2SO4 (6.5 g, 50 mmol), under an argon atmosphere. Valeraldehyde (3.3 mL, 31 mmol) is added, dropwise, followed by Amberlyst 15 (530 mg, 20%m of valeraldehyde). The mixture is heated to 80° C. with magnetic stirring. After 3 hours, the hot mixture is filtered, washed with CPME (2×25 mL) and the filtrate is concentrated under low pressure. Without additional purification, the mixture is diluted in CPME (300 mL), dried on MgSO4 and filtered. The filtrate is put in a 500-mL stainless-steel autoclave and 5%-Pd/C (3.3 mg) is added. The reactor is closed well and purged three times with hydrogen before the hydrogen is added under pressure (30 bar). The system is heated at 120° C. and stirred for 15 hours. After having been cooled to ambient temperature, the hydrogen under pressure is released, the reaction mixture is dissolved in absolute ethanol (250 mL) and filtered (0.01 micron Millipore Durapore filter). The filtrate is evaporated under low pressure and the residue (5.8 g) is purified by flash chromatography (EtOAc/cyclohexane 90:10 to 100:0, then EtOH/EtOAc 10:90). In this way a mixture of pentyl-(1,4)-sorbitan ethers (3.97 g, 56%) was obtained in the form of a colorless oil (purity >98% by NMR 1H).

Measurement of Bacteriostatic Properties of Sorbitan Acetal and Ether Derivatives on Gram-positive Bacteria
The bacteriostatic properties of the derivatives are evaluated by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) on the bacteria tested. Such a measurement is made using the 96-well microplate microdilution method according to the conditions defined below.
Bacteria Tested:
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) are tested on Gram-positive bacterial strains according to the recommendations of the “Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute” (Clinical-Laboratory-Standards-Institute, 6th ed. Approved standard M100-S17. CLSI, Wayne, Pa., 2007).
The Gram-positive bacteria studied are as follows: L. monocytogenes (CIP 103575), E. faecalis (ATCC® 29212™) and S. aureus (ATCC® 292213™).
Inoculum Preparation:
The cultures studied, freshly isolated (after incubation on a blood agar at 37° C. for 18 h), are taken up in sterile water (10 mL) until a 0.5 McFarland (Mc) suspension i.e. 1 to 2×108 CFU (bacteria)/cm3 is obtained. The bacterial suspension was then diluted to obtain a final concentration of 5×105 CFU/cm3.
Preparation of Multiwell Plates for Reading the MIC:
Each well contains an identical quantity of Mueller-Hinton medium (a rich medium for bacterial culture) and bacteria with final 5×105 CFU/cm3.
The test compounds of interest are solubilized in 2.5%m of ethanol before being diluted to different concentrations two by two.
On the multiwell plate, a first series has been planned comprising the culture medium without the test compound of interest. It corresponds to the growth control (control well). These controls serve as reference for comparing bacterial growth with that of the subsequent wells comprising different concentrations of the test compound of interest. The second series of wells comprises the mother solution for the test compound of interest for a concentration in the wells of 4 mM. Each series of wells was diluted two by two until the last series for a final concentration of 0.003 mM. Each concentration is duplicated in the same plate. The plate is incubated for 18 h at 37° C. The reading after incubation shows turbidity in the control wells (revealing bacterial growth). If there is antibacterial activity, the bacterial growth is inhibited, which means that no turbidity or bacterial residue is present. If the test compound inhibits this bacterial growth, it may correspond to either bacteriostatic activity in the molecule (inhibits bacterial growth), or to bactericidal activity in the molecule (causes bacteria to die).
Bacterial Count:
To determine whether the agents tested are bactericidal, the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is determined. The MBC corresponds to the concentration leaving a number of bacterial survivors of <4 log. For this, a bacterial count is run from clear wells or without bacterial residue (C≦MIC). To do this, a dilution to 1/100 was conducted with the two wells with the same concentration before seeding on a blood agar using the Spiral technique. After 24 h of incubation at 37° C., the visual count allowed determination of the minimum concentration from which there is no bacterial growth.
Tests have been conducted on Gram-positive bacteria with sorbitan derivatives. The solutions of test compounds are diluted in ethanol at a solvent concentration that does not act on bacterial growth (2.5%m). After sterilization the solutions are diluted in water. The results obtained for antimicrobial tests on the 3 bacterial strains L. monocytogenes (CIP 103575), E. faecalis (ATCC® 29212™) and S. aureus (ATCC® 292213™) are summarized in Table 1.

According to observations on the 96-well microplates, the sorbitan ethers and acetals with aliphatic chains less than or equal to 10 carbons do not present antimicrobial properties because all the wells contain turbidity or a bacterial residue. The only bacterial inhibition is observed for compounds derived from dodecyl (entry 5).
Indeed, with concentrations below 12 mM, the sorbitan C12 acetal and ether inhibit the bacterial strains studied.
Example 5
Bactericidal Properties of Sorbitan Acetal and Ether Derivatives on Gram-positive Bacteria
To determine the bactericidal effect of compounds presenting bacteriostatic properties, the wells no longer presenting turbidity were reseeded on agar. The results obtained after incubation for one night are presented in Table 2.

Regarding the sorbitan derivatives, only the compounds containing 12 carbon chains and presenting bacterial inhibition have been analyzed. Sorbitan dodecylidene acetal has been revealed to be a bactericidal compound for L. monocytogenes and E. faecalis strains at 0.03 mM and bacteriostatic for S. aureus at 0.12 mM. To confirm that the properties measured on the acetals are indeed those of the amphiphilic compound and not its hydrolysis products, the properties of dodecanal were tested on the different bacterial strains and no antimicrobial activity was observed at concentrations less than or equal to 4 mM. Accordingly, the C12 sorbitan acetal is active as is and this activity does not come from the corresponding aldehyde. The mixture of sorbitan dodecyl ethers has an MBC of 0.12 mM for all the Gram-positive strains tested.
Therefore the conclusion can be drawn that sorbitan C12 acetals and ethers, even in the form of a mixture of regioisomers and diastereoisomers, present very interesting antimicrobial and bactericidal properties.
These results show that sorbitan derivatives may present a new range of biosourced bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties that is very active.

Evaluation of Surfactant and Antimicrobial Properties
The physical, chemical and antimicrobial properties for the best products synthesized have been tested. These analyses show the different surfactant profiles, and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for each compound on Gram-positive bacteria. The best surfactant and antimicrobial results are compared in Table 3.

For sorbitan dodecylidene (entry 1), the CMC value is in the MIC range. Sorbitan dodecyl ether has a slightly lower CMC (0.09 mM) than its MIC (0.12 mM) but these concentrations are relatively similar all the same (entry 2).
Example 7
Comparison Tests with Compounds Known in the Prior Art
The activity of sorbitan derivatives has been compared with that of compounds having similar structures or of a commercial compound like monolaurin (ML) in the table below.

</table>
The results obtained demonstrate that the derivatives are as effective as monolaurin (ML) since the difference in MIC obtained between the mixtures of acetals (C12AcSorb) or C12 sugar ethers (C12EthSorb) and monolaurin is low.
However, the stability of ether functions in biological medium was higher than the esters (sensitive to esterases), since the compounds comprising an ether function will therefore have prolonged activity over time which makes these derivatives of the compounds particularly advantageous.
Example 8
Measurement of Bacteriostatic Properties of a C12 Sorbitan Ether on Gram-positive Bacteria
Since the best results were observed with compounds having a C12 alkyl group, experiments have been conducted on a wider panel of Gram-positive strains with a mixture of sorbitan ethers such as obtained according to the previous examples.
Inoculum Preparation:
The cultures studied, freshly isolated (after incubation on a blood agar at 37° C. for 18 h), are taken up in sterile water (10 mL) until a 0.5 McFarland (Mc) suspension i.e. at 1 to 2×108 CFU (bacteria)/cm3 is obtained. The bacterial suspension was then diluted to obtain a final concentration of 1×106 CFU/cm3.
Preparation of Multiwell Plates for Reading the MIC:
Each well contains an identical quantity of Mueller-Hinton medium (a rich medium for bacterial culture) and bacteria with final 0.5×106 CFU/cm3.
The test compounds of interest are solubilized in ethanol or DMSO at 25 mg/mL before being diluted to different concentrations two by two. On the multiwell plate, a first series has been planned comprising the culture medium without the test compound of interest. It corresponds to the growth control (control well). These controls serve as reference for comparing bacterial growth with that of the subsequent wells comprising different concentrations of the test compound of interest. The second series of wells comprises the mother solution for the test compound of interest for a concentration in the wells of 256 mg (7 mM). Each series of wells was diluted two by two until the last series for a final concentration of 0.25 mg/L (0.0007 mM). Each concentration is duplicated in the same plate. The plate is incubated for 18 h at 37° C. The reading after incubation shows turbidity in the control wells (revealing bacterial growth). If there is antibacterial activity, the bacterial growth is inhibited, which means that no turbidity or bacterial residue is present.
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) are tested on Gram-positive bacterial strains according to the recommendations of the “Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute” (Clinical-Laboratory-Standards-Institute, 6th ed. Approved standard M100-S17. CLSI, Wayne, Pa., 2007). The clinical strains have been isolated in the Hospice de Lyon.
