TECHNICAL FIELD
The presently-disclosed subject matter generally relates to pyranonaphthoquinone compounds, methods of forming pyranonaphthoquinone compounds, and methods of use thereof. In particular, certain embodiments of the presently-disclosed subject matter relate to pyranonaphthoquinone compounds, methods of forming pyranonaphthoquinone compounds, and methods for modulating cap-dependent translation and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation using pyranonaphthoquinone compounds.
BACKGROUND
Disease progression and drug resistance to anticancer therapies is often associated with mutational activation of multiple signaling pathways that promote aberrant cell growth and metastasis. For example, the aggressiveness of diseases such as metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is in part driven by the aberrant expression of oncoproteins. As such, these diseases are difficult to treat and patients have few long term effective therapeutic options. At the molecular level, cap-dependent translation of the precursor oncogenic mRNAs is frequently activated. Specifically, this occurs via 4E-BP1 phosphorylation which, when not phosphorylated, functions as a mRNA translation repressor downstream from mTOR.
Novel therapeutic approaches include pharmacologic inhibition of proteins within signaling pathways as well as converging nodes like mTOR, which is activated in many cancers. The inhibition of mTOR has been of interest because it integrates multiple signals. However, the clinical efficacy of mTOR inhibitor drugs (e.g., rapamycin analogs) is limited. It is widely believed that this is largely attributed to their weak capacity to prevent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (a key translational repressor) which, when phosphorylated by mTOR, relieves its inhibitory control on elF4E-initiated cap-dependent translation of oncogenic mRNAs that drive oncoprotein production. Existing mTOR kinase (ATP-competitive) inhibitors non-selectively inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but also modulate the function of other mTOR-associated targets that may contribute to unwanted toxicities.
Accordingly, there exists a need for effective, selective inhibition of 4E-BP1 in cancer treatment.

In certain embodiments, suitable structures corresponding to the chemical formulas disclosed for R1 above include, but are not limited to:
In some embodiments, suitable structures corresponding to the chemical formulas disclosed for R2 and R3 above include, but are not limited to:
Turning to R4 and R5, in some embodiments, as discussed above, the groups are separate and do not form a ring. One example of these embodiments includes UCF76-A (FIG. 1A), where R1 is CH2CH2CH3, R2 is OH, R3 is H, R4 is OH and R5 is CH2C(O)OCH3. In another example R1 is CH2CH2CH3, R2 is OH, R3 is H, R4 is OH and R5 is CH2C(O)OH. Alternatively, in some embodiments, where R4 and R5 of Formula I form the five membered ring discussed above, the inhibitor includes a structure according to one of the stereoisomers represented by Formula II or Formula III below:

For example, the down stereo bonds of R4 and/or R5 in the open configuration, or the down stereo bonds of the five member ring including R6, may be replaced with up stereo bonds in any one or more of the embodiments disclosed herein. Suitable structures according to Formula II, where R1 is attached through an up stereo bond, and Formula III, where R1 is attached through a down stereo bond, include, but are not limited to:

Where each R1 independently includes, but is not limited to, H, O, OH, OCH3, OC(O)CH3, N3, NH2, halide, or C1-C6 alkyl (e.g., CH3); where R2 includes, but is not limited to, H, OH, alkoxy (e.g., OCH3), halogen, or amine; where R3 includes, but is not limited to, H, OH, or halogen; where R4 includes, but is not limited to, H or OH; and where R5 includes, but is not limited to, CH2Y, CH2CH2Z, or CH2C(O)Z, where Y is CN, CH2OR, CH2NHR, COOR, or CONHR, and where Z is a bond between R4 and R5, forming a five membered ring with the carbon atoms to which R4 and R5 are attached.

and stereoisomers thereof, where R2 and R3 are as discussed above with regard to Formula IV; X is OAc, OH, or O; and Y is H or SG. For example, one griseusen A analog includes 4'-deacetyl-GA, which has the following structure:
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the structures discussed above are for illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the instant disclosure. Accordingly, other pyranonaphthoquinone and pyranonaphthoquinone analogs are expressly contemplated herein, including, but not limited to, frenolicin analogs, griseusin B, griseusin D, griseusin E, griseusin F, griseusin G, and analogs thereof.
In some embodiments, one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein is arranged and disposed to bind and/or inhibit any suitable target. Suitable targets include, but are not limited to, targets which are overproduced in one or more cancers and/or which play a key role in one or more parasitic-type diseases. For example, in one embodiment, one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein binds glutaredoxin, peroxiredoxin, or a combination thereof. As used herein, the terms “glutaredoxin” and “peroxiredoxin” include any suitable isoform thereof, such as, but not limited to, glutaredoxin 3, peroxiredoxin 1, peroxiredoxin 2, any other isoform thereof, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the binding of the one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein inhibits glutaredoxin and/or peroxiredoxin. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the compounds disclosed herein represent the first reported inhibitor of glutaredoxing to date. Again, without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that in certain embodiments the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein also provide the most potent inhibitor of peroxiredoxin to date.
Additionally or alternatively, in some embodiments, as discussed above, the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein form 4E-BP1 phosphorylation inhibitors. More specifically, in contrast to the previously held belief that pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs were Akt inhibitors, the instant inventors surprisingly discovered that one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs disclosed herein inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation through inhibition of Prx1 and/or Grx3, without or substantially without inhibiting Akt. That is, pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs disclosed herein inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in a manner that is mechanistically distinct to existing mTOR inhibitors.
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that deregulation of cap-dependent translation downstream of mTOR at the level of 4E-BP1/elF4E is a key to tumor formation and metastatic progression. More specifically, translation of key oncogenic mRNAs is strongly dependent on the mRNA cap-binding protein elF4E (FIG. 2). Consequently, expression of these oncogenic mRNAs is preferentially and disproportionately affected by elF4E availability and is sensitive to the alteration of its levels. Indeed, as in many cancers, CRC progression and poor prognosis is associated with substantially elevated elF4E levels due to elF4E upregulation and reduction in the levels of the active non-phosphorylated repressor 4E-BP1.
In this regard, the instant inventors recently discovered that activated signaling via the PI3K/AKT and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways cooperate to promote CRC progression by convergent phosphorylation (inactivation) of 4E-BP1. Additionally, the instant inventors have demonstrated that 4E-BP1 phosphorylation-mediated oncogene translation functions as a critical node that integrates oncogenic signals of the AKT and ERK pathways for CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, the instant inventors have found that CRC resistance to upstream kinase targeted therapy is associated with incomplete inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. That is, due to cooperation between the pathways, inhibition of Akt or Erk alone is insufficient to provide complete inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and therefore, is insufficient to suppress tumor growth and metastasis.
However, the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs disclosed herein form what is believed to be the first selective inhibitor of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Since the novel mechanism for inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation disclosed herein does not rely on Akt or Erk inhibition, the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs of the instant disclosure eliminate the redundant phosphorylation issues associated therewith. Additionally, pharmacoloqic activation of 4E-BP1, via pharmacological inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, disrupts cap-dependent translation by blocking converging oncogenic signals at a key node. Therefore, in one embodiment, administering at least one pyranonaphthoquinone or pyranonaphthoquinone analog modulates 4E-BP1-regulated cap-dependent translation and provides a treatment strategy for advanced CRC and/or other major cancers. Thus, in certain embodiments, the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs disclosed herein form novel anticancer drugs, where direct targeting of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation-mediated oncogene translation represents a novel strategy for cancer drug development and therapy.
Accordingly, also provided herein, in some embodiments, is a method of treating cancer including administering at least one of the pyranonaphthoquinones and/or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs to a subject in need thereof. Suitable pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs include any of the compounds disclosed herein, such as, but are not limited to, frenolicin B (FB), epi-FB, griseusin, analogs thereof, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment, the method provides selective inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.
As used herein, the term “cancer” refers to all types of cancer or neoplasm or malignant tumors found in animals, including leukemias, carcinomas, melanoma, and sarcomas. For example, the cancer may include, Hodgkin's Disease, Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, multiple myeloma, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma, primary thrombocytosis, primary macroglobulinemia, small-cell lung tumors, primary brain tumors, stomach cancer, colon cancer, colorectal cancer, malignant pancreatic insulanoma, malignant carcinoid, premalignant skin lesions, testicular cancer, lymphomas, thyroid cancer, neuroblastoma, esophageal cancer, genitourinary tract cancer, malignant hypercalcemia, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and adrenal cortical cancer. In some particular embodiments, the cancer is colorectal cancer (CRC).
Further provided herein, in some embodiments, is a method of treating a parasitic-type disease. In some embodiments, the method of treating a parasitic-type disease includes administering at least one pyranonaphthoquinone or pyranonaphthoquinone analog to a subject in need thereof. Suitable pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs include, but are not limited to, frenolicin B (FB), epi-FB, griseusin, an analog of FB, epi-FB, or griseusin, or a combination thereof.
As used herein, the term “parasitic-type disease” refers to any disease caused by or resulting from a parasite. For example, in one embodiment, parasitic-type disease includes malaria. In another embodiment, one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein provide anti-parasitic-type disease function by inhibiting one or more of the targets disclosed herein. More specifically, in certain embodiments, one or more of the pyranonaphthoquinones or pyranonaphthoquinone analogs described herein inhibit peroxiredoxin, which provides potent anti-malarial function. This peroxiredoxin inhibition may, in some embodiments, provide increased antimalarial potency as compared to existing malaria drugs/treatments.
The presently-disclosed subject matter also includes, in some embodiments, method of forming a pyranonaphthoquinone or pyranonaphthoquinone analog. In one embodiment, the method includes an enantioselective syntheses of frenolicin analogs, as described in greater detail in the Examples below. In another embodiment, the method includes a divergent process for the synthesis of both FB and epi-FB. In a further embodiment, the method provides Lewis acid catalyst optimization to facilitate increased control over diastereoselectivity in the key oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction, thereby providing access to all core stereoisomers. Additionally or alternatively, the method provides optimization of the culminating demethylation (a key deprotection step) to avoid epimerization that notably plagued prior syntheses. Methods for synthesizing griseusin and giseusin analogs are also provided herein.
Still further provided herein, in some embodiments, is a molecular probe that facilitates understanding of 4E-BP1 in tumorigenesis and metastasis. In one embodiment, the molecular probe binds to SEQ ID NO: 1 and/or SEQ ID NO: 2.

A schematic example of the mechanism of pyranonaphthaquinone inhibition of 4E-CP1 phosphorylation and tumor progression in vivo is shown in FIG. 4.
Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Novel FB-Based Analogs.
Prompted by the potentially novel mechanism of action outlined above, the instant inventors developed an efficient divergent strategy for the synthesis of both FB and epi-FB to allow for further exploration of the pyranonaphthoquinone SAR (FIG. 5A) (17). This strategy encompasses two notable advances when compared to prior reported syntheses (42-46): 1) Lewis acid catalyst optimization to enable exquisite control over diastereoselectivity in the key oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction (and thereby provide access to all core stereoisomers) and 2) optimization of the culminating demethylation (a key deprotection step) to avoid epimerization (an issue that notably plagued prior syntheses). This much improved divergent synthetic strategy has enabled the synthesis of >40 novel analogs for subsequent in vitro hit identification and prioritization assays.
Based on the preliminary mechanistic studies with naturally-occurring FB metabolites described above, an initial streamlined compound prioritization strategy that requires 90% inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation at 1 1.LM of test compound was selected as the initial filter. Compounds that pass this single dose filter are then tested in a CRC (HCT116) in vitro cytotoxicity assay and, in parallel, an in vitro assay to assess propensity for intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production using the redox sensitive probe CeIIROX® Deep Red reagent (Invitrogen) by flow cytometry analysis (47). The rationale for inclusion of ROS induction as a key criterion stems from the well-established liabilities of quinones (namely, as oxidants and electrophiles) (48-50) and the demonstrated ability of ROS to activate key signaling pathways of relevance to cancer (51, 52). These data are then correlated as illustrated in FIG. 5B where it is believed that compounds in quadrant III (high anticancer potency, low ROS generation) present highly specific and potent 4E-BP1 phosphorylation inhibitors with limited quinone-based non-specific liabilities.
Using this general strategy, initial SAR analyses (FIG. 5) revealed: 1) importance of the juglone (the fused A and B ring hydroxynaphthoquinone) core with tolerance to regiospecificity of the corresponding hydroxyl (C6 or C9); 2) tolerance to modest C6 and C8 substitution of the A ring; 3) notable tolerance to C1 modification of the C ring; 4) a slight improvement in activity with ‘open’ D-ring esters (e.g., UCF76-A) including those lacking the C4 hydroxyl; and 5) a trend toward increased 4E-BP1-dependent cytotoxicity and reduced toxicity indicators with epi-FB analogs. Based upon this cumulative analysis, higher priority analogs include: a70, b47, a86 and b132 (FIGS. 5B-C), where a positive correlation between 4E-BP1 phosphorylation inhibitory potency and HCT116 cell line cytotoxicity potency as indicated by growth inhibition and induction of cleaved PARP was also apparent (FIG. 5B). It is also important to note that, while azide anion (such as NaN3) is known as scavenger of singlet oxygen (53), organic azides do not display similar properties. Thus, a70 clearly stands out as uniquely active among this priority set and, in conjunction with its inactive structural comparator all1, notably presents an outstanding reagent set for the chemoselective pulldown target identification studies presented herein.
A representative member (b47) from this priority set was further studied in secondary assays as an additional assessment of the prioritization strategy. Specifically, b47 (4-fold more potent than FB against HCT116 but 2-fold less proficient at ROS production, (FIGS. 5B-C) was also found to be 4-fold more potent than FB as an inhibitor of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (FIG. 6A). Moreover, b47 was also 2-fold less cytotoxic than FB to normal mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) (FIG. 6B) and double knockout of 4E-BP1 and 4E-BP2 (54) in MEFs also reduced the cytotoxic effect of b47 (FIG. 6C).
Epi-FB-Based Analog Synthesis.
Chemistries directed toward further epi-FB-based analoging are first directed toward further assessment of the impact of C1 variation (FIG. 7A). The optimal C1 substitutions are subsequently evaluated in the context of focused ring A variation (FIG. 7B, (17)), the primary basis of which derives from the best C6/C9 substitutions as determined by preliminary studies described. In addition, the impact of modified open D ring analogs (FIG. 7B, (18)) is being pursued. All proposed analogs are anticipated to be accessible using the general strategy highlighted in FIG. 5A from either commercially available precursors or key starting materials available in four or fewer steps from commercially available reagents.
Example 2-Griseusins
Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluation of Novel Griseusins.
In view of the data above, SAR was further expand with a particular emphasis on C1 modification of the C ring. Within this context, the griseucins (FIG. 8A) isolated from Streptomyces griseus and Nocardiopsis sp., are structurally-related pyranonapthoquinones that notably contain an additional fused C1 spiro-ring system (ring E). This new grisuesin ring E is further elaborated in some members via oxidation, acetylation and/or glycosylation and, like the naturally-occurring frenolicin UCF76-A, some griseusin members also contain an ‘open’ D-ring ester (55-61). While members of this family have been noted for their potent antibiotic, antifungal, and anticancer activities, it is noteworthy that, like kalafugin, 4-dehydro-deacetylgriseusin A was recently identified as COMPARE-negative, consistent with a potentially novel anticancer mechanism (61). Thus, we recently developed an efficient divergent synthetic strategy to access both naturally-occurring griseusins and non-natural analogs (FIG. 8B).
Importantly, in contrast to prior reported synthetic approaches to the griseusins (62-66), the instant method (which draws conceptually on the inventors previously described work with the frenolicin series) stands as the first truly divergent enantioselective method and the most efficient strategy to date. Six griseusin analogs have been synthesized via this method, two of which have been further evaluated in in vitro assays (FIG. 8C). What is particularly striking from this preliminary analysis is the impact of subtle structural modification upon 4E-BP1 phosphorylation inhibition (FIG. 8C) and corresponding HCT116 cytotoxicity. Specifically, while GC displays notable inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cytotoxicity (GC HCT116 IC50 127 nM), simple inversion of the E ring C3' stereochemistry led to a reduction in both (d43 HCT116 IC50 345 nM). In addition, ROS production by GC was also slightly lower than that of the improved FB analog b47 (FIG. 5B). Notably, this work reveals, for the first time, griseusins as effective inhibitors of 4E BP1 phosphorylation and also highlights an efficient and divergent griseusin synthetic strategy.
Griseusin Analog Synthesis.
Using the established divergent strategy highlighted in FIG. 8B, a focused set of E ring-modified griseusin variants may be pursued, the diversification elements of which may focus upon the C/E ring fusion stereochemistry as well as C3', C4' and C6'-substitution/stereochemistry. Further optimization may focus upon integrating key A and/or open D ring variations determined to be advantageous in the context of epi-FB analogs described above within the best griseusin ring E-modified analogs.
Example 3
Altered redox status is a common feature of many cancers in which deregulation of cell signaling and metabolism by multiple genetic alterations often lead to increased generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although intracellular ROS elevation contributes to tumor initiation and progression, it is believed that agents capable of increasing intracellular ROS beyond the cellular tolerability threshold may represent a potential selective anticancer therapeutic strategy. Within this context, this Example reports the identification of the molecular target and anticancer mechanism of frenolicin B (FB), a classical, but mechanistically undefined, pyranonaphthoquinone (PNQ) natural product commonly used as an anticoccidial feedstock additive.
Specifically, in this Example, FB is identified as a selective inhibitor of peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) and glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3), two antioxidant proteins overexpressed in many cancers that play key roles in maintaining cellular redox status. Inhibition of Prx1 and Grx3 by FB induces a concomitant elevation of intracellular ROS which activates the peroxisome-bound tuberous sclerosis complex and thereby inhibits mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of the translation repressor 4E-BP1, a key effector of the oncogenic activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathways in tumorigenesis and metastasis. FB structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies reveal a positive correlation between inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, intracellular ROS concentrations, cancer cell cytotoxicity and suppression of tumor growth in vivo. These findings establish FB as the most potent and novel Prx1/Grx3 inhibitor reported to date and also notably highlights 4E-BP1 phosphorylation status as a potential new predictive marker in response to oxidative stress-based therapies in cancer.
Dysregulation of cap-dependent translation through redundant phosphorylation of the translational repressor 4E-BP1 by multiple oncogenic pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, is associated with malignant progression and therapeutic resistance. To determine the importance of 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation in the repression of cap-dependent translation and tumor progression, a non-phosphorylated 4E-BP1 mutant, 4E-BP1-4A, was generated. The four known phosphorylation sites, T37, T46, S65, and T70 (FIG. 2), are inactivated via alanine replacement. This 4E-BP1 mutant cannot be phosphorylated, binds constitutively to elF4E, and inhibits elF4E-initiated cap-dependent translation (13). As compared to wild-type (WT) 4E-BP1 and vector control, expression of 4E-BP1-4A profoundly suppressed tumor growth and liver metastasis in the HCT116 CRC model (13, 14) (FIGS. 9A-C).
Thus, targeting cap-dependent translation may overcome intra-tumor heterogeneity-mediated resistance and provide a promising strategy for improving cancer therapy. To identify microbial nature products (NPs) capable of targeting cap-dependent translation, crude extracts of prioritized microbes from the Ruth Mullins underground coal mine fire site14 were screened using a cap-dependent translation-based luciferase reporter assay5. This initial screen revealed that extracts of Streptomyces sp. RM-4-15, a strain previously identified to produce a series of known and novel pyranonaphthoquinones (PNQs)15, contain compounds capable of inhibiting cap-dependent translation (FIG. 10A). Identical assays with purified metabolites from Streptomyces sp. RM-4-15 showed that FB and the related PNQ metabolite UCF76-A could effectively inhibit cap-dependent translation (FIG. 10B). In addition, FB and UCF76-A exhibited potent cytotoxicity against a panel of colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines (FIGS. 10C and 11). These initial studies highlighted a previously unknown function of PNQs as potent inhibitors of cap-dependent translation.
To further probe the function of PNQs within the context of cap-dependent translation, the ability of FB and UCF76-A to modulate 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation was compared to that of representative mTOR inhibitors. The mTOR kinase complex 1 (mTORC1), a downstream target of both AKT and ERK signaling, is a well-characterized activator of cap-dependent translation through phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70S6 kinase17. Rapamycin is an allosteric inhibitor of mTORC1 and can effectively inhibit p70S6K phosphorylation, but only weakly inhibits 4E-BP1 phosphorylation18, while second generation ATP-competitive mTOR kinase inhibitors such as AZD8055 that inhibit both mTORC1 and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) are more effective than rapamycin in inhibiting 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Like AZD8055 but distinct from rapamycin, FB and UCF76-A effectively inhibited 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in HCT116 CRC cells (FIG. 12).
Both rapamycin and AZD8055 potently inhibited phosphorylation of p70S6K and its substrate, the ribosomal protein S6, and AZD8055 also inhibited phosphorylation of the mTORC2 substrate AKT17. In contrast, FB or UCF76-A did not inhibit S6 or AKT phosphorylation, only weakly inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation, but were potent activators of caspase 3 with induction of the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP and dramatic suppression of HCT116 cell growth (FIGS. 12 and 13). While FB was previously reported to inhibit AKT activity in vitro, no detectable inhibition of AKT phosphorylation or that of its substrate PRAS40 was observed in HCT116 cells treated with FB or UCF76-A (FIG. 12). In addition, effective inhibition of AKT phosphorylation by the highly selective pan-AKT-1/2/3 inhibitor MK220621 led to negligible modulation of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (FIG. 12), consistent with our previous findings that simultaneous inhibition of both AKT (MK2206) and MEK/ERK (PD0325901) signaling is required to inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (FIG. 12) and repress cap-dependent translation in CRC cells5. Similar effects by FB and UCF76-A were also observed in other CRC (DLD-1) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines (FIG. 14). Furthermore, Invitrogen SelectScreen® Kinase Profiling also revealed no effect on mTOR kinase activity by representative PNQs (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggested that the inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by PNQ-based NPs is mechanistically distinct from that of known mTOR, AKT and/or MEK/ERK inhibitors.
Prompted by the potential mechanistic novelty of PNQs, we evaluated additional FB-based PNQ synthetic analogs (FIG. 15) for CRC cell cytotoxicity (FIG. 16A) and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation inhibitory potential (FIG. 16B). Enabled by our recently reported divergent FB synthetic strategy22, preliminary SAR analysis highlighted a clear correlation between cancer cell cytotoxicity, induction of cleaved PARP, and inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (FIGS. 16A-B) where improvements of up to 4-fold in potency over FB were observed (e.g., 12, FIG. 16C). Consistent with ability of dephosphophorylated 4E-BP1 to bind to the eIF4E-mRNA cap complex and suppress cap-dependent translation, active analogs displayed similar effects (FIGS. 17A-B) as exemplified by the correlation of increased inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cap-dependent translation (FIGS. 16C and 18A-B) with improved anti-HCT116 potency and enhanced induction of cell death (FIGS. 18C-D) with 12. Notably, silencing 4E-BP1 gene expression in HCT116 cancer cells as generated previously6 almost completely rescued the inhibition on cap-dependent translation activity by FB or 12 (FIG. 19). These data further established the central role of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation in response to PNQ-mediated cancer cell death.
To identify the PNQ molecular target(s) responsible for the observed inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and cancer cell cytotoxicity, a comparative affinity pulldown-based target identification strategy was employed. Specifically, guided by the SAR studies described, two FB-based biotinylated probes were synthesized. ‘Active’ probe 1 (d7) retained FB-like activity (inhibition of 4EBP1 phosphorylation and CRC cell line cytotoxicity), while the corresponding activities of structurally-related ‘inactive’ comparator probe 2 (d5) were notably suppressed (FIG. 20A). Parallel incubation of probes 1 and 2 with the Hela cell lysates followed by comparative affinity pulldown and mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis revealed peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) (SEQ ID NO: 1) and glutaredoxin 3 (Grx3) (SEQ ID NO: 2) as principle targets of FB (FIGS. 20B-C). The putative FB-Prx1 and FB-Grx3 interaction was also confirmed using HCT116 cellular extracts and pure Prx1 and Grx3 via a ligand-binding competition assay (FIGS. 20D and 21A-B). Immunofluorescence staining with an antibody against Prx1 or Grx3 and a biotin antibody also revealed colocalization of probe 1 with Prx1 and Grx3 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of HCT116 cells (FIGS. 21C-D).
Prx1 and Grx3 are antioxidant enzymes known to regulate oxidative stress. Prx1 catalyzes peroxide reduction of H2O2, whereas Grx3 functions as glutathione (GSH)-dependent oxidoreductase by participating in the conversion of reduced GSH to oxidized glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Biochemical inhibition studies using recombination Prx1 revealed FB or semi-synthetic 12 as potent inhibitors of Prx1 with observed KiS >60-fold lower than the most potent Prx1 inhibitor, conoidin A, reported to date (FIGS. 22A-B) and >XX-fold lower than the recently reported Prx1 inhibitor adenanthin. While Grx3 biochemical assays are lacking, FB and active analogs could lead to a decrease in GSH levels and an increase in GSSG levels in HCT116 cells (FIGS. 23A-B). As antioxidant enzymes utilize cysteine-containing active sites to reduce various cellular peroxide or disulfide substrates, the role of Prx1/Grx3 cysteines in FB ligand-binding was assessed through replacing their cysteines to alanines. These studies showed that Prx1 on Cys83 and Grx3 on both Cys159 and Cys261 are essential to FB ligand-binding based on probe 1 affinity capture or immunoprecipitation of Prx1 or Grx3 (FIGS. 24A-B and 25A-C). Finally, mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the covalent modification of Prx1 and Grx3 by FB at these specific target sites. These cumulative studies provide strong validation of Prx1 and Grx3 as the predominate molecular targets of PNQs in cancer cells.
Consistent with Prx1 and Grx3 as the molecular targets, it was found that FB and active surrogates (FIGS. 15 and 16A-B) induce a marked increase in cellular H2O2 and ROS (FIGS. 26A-B). Reminiscent of the effects observed with FB treatment, direct treatment of HCT116 cells with H2O2 led to a concentration-dependent inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and induction of cleaved PARP (FIG. 27) but these effects induced by FB and active analogs were completely abrogated by pretreatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine, which blocked FB or its analogs-induced ROS (FIG. 28). Similarly, silencing Prx1 or Grx3 expression also increased cellular H2O2 levels and led to a concomitant suppression of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and induction of cleaved PARP, whereas these effects were further enhanced when both Prx1 and Grx3 expression were silenced (FIGS. 29A-C). ROS has been reported to inhibit mTORC1 signaling by activating peroxisome-bound tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC){Zhang, 2013 #1450}. Consistent with this, inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and induction of cleaved PARP by FB or 12 were largely prevented in peroxisome-deficient human Zellweger (GM13629) fibroblasts and TSC2-knockdown HCT116 cells (FIGS. 30A-B). Together, these data indicate that PNQs target both Prx1 and Grx3 to increase H2O2 or ROS level that is essential for inhibition of mTORC1-mediated 4E-BP1 phosphorylation correlated with induction of cell death.
To assess whether this unique anticancer mechanism translates to in vivo efficacy, we utilized an aqueous soluble phosphate prodrug 14 synthesized from 12 in two steps (65% overall yield, FIG. 31). Nude mice bearing established HCT116 or DLD-1 colon cancer xenografts were treated with 14 at a predetermined maximum tolerated dose, 14 mg/kg, daily for five days a week or saline control for 2 weeks. Administration of 14 was able to suppress overall tumor progression and caused 56% (DLD-1) or 64% (HCT116) tumor reduction without significant weight loss (FIGS. 32-33). Western blot analysis of tumor extracts revealed inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation associated with induction of cleaved PARP by 14 (FIG. 34A). These findings highlight the potential effectiveness of 14 in suitable animal model for CRC and, consistent with the in vitro studies, implicate the inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation as a contributor to the mechanism of action (FIG. 34B).
FB is the prototypical PNQ-based NP first reported in the late 60's23 and has since been demonstrated to function as an effective anticoccidial and antimalarial24, the fundamental mechanism(s) for which remain undetermined. The current study highlights, for the first time, that FB and PNQ-based analogs function as inhibitors of Prx1 and Grx3 for cancer therapy by targeting ROS stress-response pathway in which 4E-BP1 phosphorylation functions as a major sensor to guide for the development of this new class of agents and predict their antitumor efficacy. Overexpression of Prx1 and Grx3 often occurs in a variety of cancers, and is associated with redox adaptation that promotes tumor progression and resistance to many anticancer agents and radiation. The use of agents such as PNQs as identified here to abrogate the adaptation mechanism due to the increased intracellular antioxidant capacity in combination with conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy or target therapy could be an attractive new approach to improve therapeutic outcomes.

Cell Culture and Transfection.
Human colon (HCT116, DLD-1, T84, HCT15, RKO, SW620) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.) and cultured in the appropriate medium with supplements as recommended by ATCC. All the cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination via PCR (e-Myco Plus kit; iNtRON Biotechnology) and were found to be negative. In addition, all the cell lines are routinely checked for morphologic and growth changes, to probe for cross-contaminated, or genetically drifted cells. If any of these features occur, we use the short tandem repeat (STR) profiling service by ATCC to re-authenticate the cell lines. HCT116 cells with stable knockdown of 4E-BP1 and its control stable transfectants were generated as described previously {Ye, 2014 #1007}. For transient transfection, cells were transiently transfected with DNA using Lipofectamine 3000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif.).
Generation of Stable Cells Using Lentiviral Infection.
The lentiviral-based shRNA (pLKO.1 plasmids) used to knock down expression of human Prx1 and Grx3, and the Non-Target Control shRNA (SHC002) were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.). On the basis of knockdown efficiency of Prx1 and Grx3 protein expression in HCT116 cells, we selected two shPrx1 and two shGrx3 clones for this study. The mature antisense sequences are as follows: 5'-GCTTT CAGTGATAGGGCAGAA-3' (shPrx1_1) (SEQ ID NO: 3), 5'-GATGAGACTTTGAGACTAGTT-3' (shPrx1_2) (SEQ ID NO: 4), 5'-CCTACCTATCCTCAGCTCTAT-3' (shGrx3_1) (SEQ ID NO: 5), 5'-GAACGAAGTTATGGCAGAGTT-3' (shGrx3_2) (SEQ ID NO: 6). To generate lentivirus-expressing shRNA for Prx1 and Grx3, we transfected 293T cells with pLKO.1-non-silence (for vector control virus), pLKO.1-shPrx1 or pLKO.1-shGrx3 with Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was changed, and then it was collected at 24-h intervals. The collected medium containing lentivirus was filtered through 0.45-mm filters. Cells were seeded at 50% confluence 24 h before infection, and the media were replaced with a medium containing lentivirus. After infection for 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh medium and the infected cells were selected with 2 μg ml−1 puromycin for 7-10 days as described previously {Ye, 2014 #1007}.
Plasmids.
The human Prx1 and Grx3 were cloned into the pCMV6-Entry expression vector with C-terminal Myc-Flag Tag (PS100001, OriGene, Rockville, Md.) for transient transfection. Using the pCMV6-Prx1-Myc-Flag or pCMV6-Grx3-Myc-Flag as a template, the Prx1 mutant (C51A, C71A, C83A, C173A) and Grx3 mutant (C46A, C146A, C159A, C229A, C261A, C159A/C261A) constructs were generated using the QuikChange XLII site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.). The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table 1. All constructs were confirmed using enzyme digestion and automated DNA sequencing.

Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation.
Cells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10% glycerol, protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Western blot analysis were performed using equivalent total protein loadings as described previously. For immunoprecipitation, the cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibody overnight followed by incubation with a 50% slurry of protein G sepharose beads for 3 h at 4° C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, and the immunoprecipitated protein complexes were resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by western blot analysis.
Cap-Dependent Translation Assay.
Cells (8×104) were transfected with a bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmid (0.2 μg), pcDNA3-rLuc-PolioIRES-fLuc, which directs cap-dependent translation of the Renilla luciferase gene and cap-independent Polio IRES-mediated translation of the firefly luciferase gene. After 24 h transfection, cells were treated with indicated compounds for 12 h, and cell lysates were assayed for Renilla and firefly luciferase activities using a dual-luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, Wis.). Cap-dependent Renilla luciferase activity was normalized against cap-independent firefly luciferase activity as the internal control. The ratio of Renilla/firefly luciferase activity was calculated for cap-dependent translational activity as described previously. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
Cap-Binding Assay.
Cap-binding assay was performed as described previously. Briefly, cell lysates (500 μg protein) as prepared in the NP-40 lysis buffer were incubated at 4° C. overnight with m7GTP Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, Pa.) to capture eIF4E and its binding partners. Precipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer followed by western blot analysis.

The cells were cultured for 3 days and the number of viable cells was counted using the Vi-CELL XR 2.03 (Beckman Coulter, Brea, Calif.). For apoptosis, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.).
Pull-Down and MS Analysis of FB-Bound Proteins.
To identify the target protein for FB, FB-based biotinylated active d7 and inactive d5 were synthesized as described in XXXX. HeLa cell pellets were purchased from National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, Minn.) and lysed in 20 ml of the NP-40 lysis buffer. The cell lysates (250 mg protein) were pre-cleared with 200 μl streptavidin beads (20353, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, N.Y.) at 4° C. for 1 h. Binding reactions were performed by incubating the pre-cleared cell lysates (125 mg proteins/40 ml) with 2 μM d5 or d7 at 4° C. for 3 h, followed by adding 100 μl streptavidin beads and incubating the mixtures overnight at 4° C. After incubation, the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and the bead-bound proteins were eluted, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. The protein-containing band in the gel was excised, followed by in-gel digestion and analysis by LC-MS/MS.
Immunofluorescence.
Cells grown on glass bottom culture dishes were incubated with 25 μM d5, 25 μM d7 or DMSO as control for 5 h. After treatment, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.5% BSA in PBS for 5 min and then blocked with 4% BSA in PBS for 10 min. The cells were incubated overnight at 4° C. with the rabbit polyclonal antibody against Prx1 (1:200, ab15571, Abcam) and mouse monoclonal anti-Biotin-FITC (1:200, 200-092-211, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.), or with the mouse monoclonal antibody against Grx3 (1:200, MAB7560, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) and rabbit polyclonal anti-Biotin-FITC (1:200, ab53469, Abcam). After three washes with 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS, cells were incubated with anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with Texas-Red for Prx1 (1:500, 111-585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch) or anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Texas-Red for Grx3 (1:500, 111-585-144, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Cells were washed, mounted with UltraCruz DAPI containing mounting medium (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), viewed, and photographed under a FluoView 1200 confocal microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, Pa.).
Measurement of Cellular ROS and H2O2 Production.
The ROS production was determined using the CellROX Deep Red Flow Cytometry Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies). Briefly, cells were treated with 2 μM of the indicated compounds or DMSO as control for 1 h. After treatment, cells were incubated with 0.5 μM of CellROX Deep Red reagent for 1 h at 37° C., washed twice with PBS and immediately analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometer. For the measurement of cellular H2O2 level, cells were treated with 2 μM of the indicated compounds for 5 h.
Cellular Glutathione Assay.
Cells were treated with 2 μM of the indicated compounds or DMSO as control for 5 h. After treatment, a total number of 1×106 cells were lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold NP-40 lysis buffer for 10 min. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min and the supernatant was used for glutathione assay using the ApoGSH glutathione detection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioVision Research Products, Mountain view, CA). The total amount of GSH was measured using a fluorescence plate reader at Ex./Em.=380/460 nm.
Quantification of Glutathione Disulfide (GSSG).
Cells were treated with 2 μM of the indicated compounds or DMSO as control for 5 h. Quantification of GSSG was essentially performed using the manufactures instructions for a microplate assay for GSH/GSSG (Oxford Biomedical Research, Inc, Oxford, Mich.). A total number of 0.5×106 cells were collected in 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes containing ice-cold buffer with the thiol scavenger to keep GSSG in its oxidized form. The cells were homogenized with a Teflon pestle and the cell suspension sonicated in icy water for 2-3 minutes. Ice-cold metaphosphoric acid was added to deproteinate the samples. The samples were centrifuged at 1000×g at 4° C. and the supernatants were used for determining the GSSG concentration according to the manufactures protocol using a microplate reader with 405 nm filter. The change in GSSG levels in the indicated compound-treated samples was expressed as fold change compared to control (DMSO) treated samples.
Animal Experiments.
Male athymic nude mice (5-6 weeks old) were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, N.Y., USA). Experiments were carried out under a protocol approved by the University of Kentucky Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. HCT116 and DLD-1 xenograft tumors were established by subcutaneously injecting 3×106 cells in a 1:1 mixture of media and Matrigel (BD Biosciences) into the right flank. For efficacy studies, mice were randomized among control and treated groups (n=8 per group) when tumors were well-established (˜120 mm3). Compound 14 was prepared freshly in saline and administered by intraperitoneal injection at 14 mg/kg once per day, Mon-Fri per week. Control mice received saline solution. Tumor dimensions were measured using a caliper and tumor volumes were calculated as mm3=π/6× larger diameter×(smaller diameter)2. Tumors were excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized in 2% SDS lysis buffer and then processed for Western blot analysis as described previously5.
Statistical Analysis.
Results are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. where applicable. A two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare between groups as outlined in each legend. Differences between groups were considered statistically significant at P<0.05.
