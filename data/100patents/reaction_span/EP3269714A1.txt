The present invention relates to substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives as selective inhibitors of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and their use in therapy. In particular, the present invention relates to the use of substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives for the treatment of cancer and central nervous system disease.
The present invention relates to substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole compounds which modulate the activity of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, in particular inhibit the activity of tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase. Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO, EC 1.13.11.11) is an oxidoreductase that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway of L-tryptophan degradation. L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid required for the synthesis of proteins and the production of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy tryptamine (serotonin) and niacin (vitamin B3). Both L-tryptophan and L-tryptophan metabolites formed along the kynurenine pathway are regulators of the immune response.
TDO is mainly expressed in the liver and is induced by the stress hormone cortisol and by L-tryptophan. In addition, TDO is overexpressed in many tumors. In particular, TDO was found to be expressed in tumor samples from bladder carcinomas, melanomas, and hepatocellular carcinomas (Pilotte, L., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 2497; 2012). TDO was also found to be expressed in brain, liver and colon cancer cell lines (Pilotte et al.; Opitz, C.A., et al., Nature 478: 197; 2011; Seegers, N., et al., J. Biomol. Screen. 19: 1266; 2014). Expression of TDO in cancer cells inhibited the proliferation of activated T cells by depleting L-tryptophan (Schmidt, S.K., et al., Eur. J. Immunol. 39: 2755; 2009). TDO expressed in mouse tumor cells prevented their rejection and this effect could be reverted by LM10, a selective inhibitor of TDO (Pilotte, L., et al.). The effect only occurred in immunocompetent mice and not in a immune-deficient mice strain. This suggests that overexpression of TDO in tumors can create a state of immune tolerance, and that this state can be broken with a TDO inhibitor. Mice treated with LM10 did not show any signs of toxicity in the liver or any other organs, indicating that treatment with a TDO inhibitor can be safe (Pilotte, L., et al.)
Above data provide the basis of the use TDO inhibitors as an approach for selective anti-cancer therapy.
TDO inhibitors can be applied in anti-cancer therapy as single anti-cancer agent (monotherapy) or in combination with other anti-cancer agents. TDO inhibitors may also be applied in anti-cancer therapy with other agents that activate the immune response, such as radiotherapy, or cellular therapies that attack tumor cells directly, such as natural killer cell or T cell therapies.
L-Tryptophan and metabolites formed along the kynurenine pathway play diverse role in the regulation of functions of the central nervous system (Vécsei, L., et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 12: 64; 2013). L-tryptophan is a precursor of serotonin (5-hydroxy tryptamine), while metabolites formed in the kynurenine pathway have neurotoxic activity. Increased levels of TDO protein and mRNA, and increased metabolites were found in postmortem samples of patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Miller, C.L, et al., Brain Res. 1073-1074: 25; 2006). Increased levels of metabolites have also been found in the brains of people with Huntington's disease (Reynolds, G.P., et al., J. Neurochem. 50: 1959; 1988; Reynolds, G.P., and Pearson, S.J., Lancet 2: 979; 1989), Parkinson's disease (Ogawa, T., et al., Neurology 42: 1702; 1992) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated neurocognitive disorder (AIDS dementia complex) (Heyes, M.P., et al., FASEB J., 12: 881; 1998). Mice deficient for the TDO gene showed less anxiety-related behavior and increased neurogenesis (Kanai, M., et al., Mol. Brain 2:8; 2009). Genetic inactivation of TDO in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans decreased the toxic accumulation of proteins in models of Huntington's and Parkinson's disease (Campesan, S., et al., Curr. Biol. 21: 961; 2011; van der Goot, A., et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109: 14912; 2012). Madge et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 6, 857; 1996) described indole derivatives as TDO inhibitors. Dosing of rats resulted in a 2.5-fold increase of L-tryptophan, and a 1.5 times increase of serotonin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid.
Above data provide the biologic basis for the application of TDO inhibitors in the treatment of diseases of the central nervous system.
TDO inhibitors can be applied as single agent (monotherapy), or in combination with other therapeutically active agents, such as for instance, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for treating depression.
Thus inhibiting TDO activity, thereby increasing L-tryptophan concentrations and decreasing L-tryptophan metabolite concentration is a promising way of treating diseases, disorders and other pathological conditions arising from an increased L-tryptophan degradation.
Small molecule inhibitors of TDO are currently being developed to treat or prevent pathological conditions that are dependent or induced by increased degradation of L-tryptophan or by increased formation of metabolites of L-tryptophan, such as the diseases and disorders described above. The use of small molecule inhibitors of TDO in therapy has been described.
Madge, D.J., et al. (Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 6, 857; 1996) described indole derivatives with TDO inhibitory activity and combined inhibitors of TDO and serotonin uptake.
WO 2015/067782 A1 describes 4-(indol-3-yl)-pyrazole derivatives as inhibitors of TDO. WO2015/121812 A1 discloses 3(-indol-3-yl)-pyridine derivatives that modulate the TDO enzyme. WO2015/140717 A1 describes substituted indole derivatives as TDO inhibitors.
Several TDO inhibitors also inhibit the activity of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in biochemical assays (Seegers, N., et al., J. Biomol. Screen. 19: 1266; 2014). For example, WO 2016/024233 A1, WO 2016/026772 A1, WO2016/071283 A1 and WO2016/071293 A1 describe different chemical classes with combined TDO and IDO1 inhibitory activity.
IDO1 is a structurally unrelated oxidoreductase that catalyzes the same reaction as TDO in the kynurenine pathway. IDO1 has a higher affinity (KM, Trp) for L-tryptophan (6 µM) than TDO (190 µM) (Lu, C., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 131: 12866; Klockow, J.L. et al., Organic Lett. 15: 235; 2013). IDO1 is broadly expressed at sites of immune cell activity and is induced by gamma interferon. Cross-reactivity of TDO inhibitors against IDO1 can be determined in enzyme assays.
Both TDO and IDO1 contain a heme cofactor. Also cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), which are enzymes involved in the metabolism of drugs in the liver and other organs, contain a heme cofactor. Inhibition of CYP activity can cause adverse drug interactions, since by inhibition of CYP, one drug may affect the metabolism and clearance of a second drug. Consequently, the second drug may accumulate to toxic levels within the body, and adjustments of dosage levels may be necessary. Cross-reactivity of TDO inhibitors against CYPs can be determined in enzyme assays.
In view of the role of TDO in (the onset of) a variety of human diseases, disorders and other pathological conditions arising from an increased L-tryptophan degradation associated with an increased activity of TDO, there is a clear need for TDO inhibitors that are potent, selective and that do not cross react with IDO1 and/or CYPs.
It is an object of the invention to provide novel TDO inhibitors. It is another object of the invention to provide novel TDO inhibitors which are selective for TDO and do not cross-react with IDO1 and/or CYP. It is yet a further objective of the present invention to provide novel, selective TDO inhibitors which have a potent cellular activity.
The present invention provides for such TDO inhibitors. In particular, the present invention provides for substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives as potent inhibitors of TDO. The present invention provides for substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives which selectively inhibit TDO activity, their use in therapy, either as a sole agent or in combination with other therapeutically active ingredients, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and pharmaceutical carriers.
In particular, the present invention relates to the use of substituted 3-phenyl-1H-indole derivatives in the treatment and/or prevention of a diverse array of diseases, pathological conditions and disorders associated with an increased activity of TDO, including cancer and central nervous system disease or disorders.

More preferably, the compounds according to Formula I have an inhibitory potency on TDO with an IC50 of 500 nM or less, such as e.g. the compounds of examples 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 26, 27, 31, 36, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 86, 87, 93, 94, 95, 97, 100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 119, 120, 122, 127, 129, 131, 132, 136. Particularly preferred are compounds according to Formula I which have an inhibitory potency on TDO with an IC50 of 200 nM or less, such as e.g. the compounds of examples 1, 2, 8, 15, 19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 52, 54, 55, 58, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 118, 123, 124, 125, 133, 134, 135, 137. The compounds according to Formula I were found to have excellent cellular potency with selectivity over IDO1 and CYP.
The term IC50 means the concentration of the test compound that is required for 50% inhibition of its maximum effect in vitro.
Inhibition of TDO activity can be measured by determining the enzymatic conversion of L-tryptophan into N-formylkynurenine (NFK) in a reaction mixture containing TDO and test compound. The formation of NFK can be detected directly by, for instance, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods, or by intrinsic fluorescence. The formation of NFK can also be measured by using a chemical probe that reacts specifically with NFK to form a fluorescent product (Seegers, N. et al., J. Biomol. Screen. 19: 1266; 2014). Alternatively, the NFK formed in the reaction can be determined after a chemical reaction, i.e., NFK can be hydrolyzed to kynurenine, which can be measured by absorbance, fluorescence or HPLC methods (Matin, A., et al., Anal. Biochem. 349: 96; 2006).
The biological activity of TDO inhibitors can be measured by applying above detection methods to cells that are treated with test compound. Endogenous expression of TDO has been determined in a variety of cancer cell lines (Pilotte et al. ; Seegers, et al.), or TDO can be expressed in cells that lack endogenous TDO by transfection of an expression vector containing TDO cDNA. For the purpose of this invention, the IC50 is the concentration of the test compound that is required for 50% inhibition of its maximum effect in vitro, measured in a biochemical or cell based assay, such as the assays described by Seegers et al, 2014 supra. A preferred assay is the cell-based NFK GreenScreen™ assay (Seegers et al, supra), which measures the cellular inhibitory activity of compounds on TDO. For the purpose of this invention, potent cellular activity is defined as having an IC50 value of 2 µM or less, measured in a cell-based assay such as described by Seegers et al, 2014 supra. Unless expressed differently, all IC50 values relating to the inhibitory potency on TDO are based on cell-based inhibitory activity of the TDO inhibitors. Selectivity over IDO1 is defined as having a biochemical inhibitory activity on IDO1 with IC50 values of 25 µM or more, measured in a biochemical assay such as e.g. the NFK GreenScreen™ assay. Selectivity over CYP is defined as having a biochemical inhibitory activity on CYPs with IC50 values of 5 µM or more, measured in a biochemical assay such as e.g. the P450-Glo CYP3A4 luciferin isopropylacetal (Luc-IP) assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, Cat. No. V9920).
The compounds of Formula I can form salts which are also within the scope of this invention. Reference to a compound of Formula I herein is understood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise indicated. The term "salt(s)", as employed herein, denotes acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. In addition, when a compound of Formula I may contain both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, zwitterions ("inner salts") may be formed and are included within the term "salt(s)" as used herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e., non-toxic, physiologically acceptable) salts are preferred. Salts of the compounds of the Formula I may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of Formula I with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.
Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartrates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates) and the like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.) Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, J.of Pharm. Sci. (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, Int. J. Pharm. (1986) 33 201-21 7; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website).
Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, tert-butyl amines, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others.
The compounds of Formula I may have the ability to crystallize in more than one form, a characteristic known as polymorphism, and it is understood that such polymorphic forms ("polymorphs") are within the scope of Formula I. Polymorphism generally can occur as a response to changes in temperature or pressure or both and can also result from variations in the crystallization process. Polymorphs can be distinguished by various physical characteristics known in the art such as x-ray diffraction patterns, solubility and melting point.
The compounds of Formula I contain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I as well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form part of the present invention. In addition, the present invention embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For example, if a compound of Formula I incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis-and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the scope of the invention.
Diastereomeric mixtures can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization. Enantiomers can be separated by converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active compound (e.g. chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or Mosher's acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and converting (e.g. hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the compounds of Formula I may be atropisomers (e.g. substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this invention. Enantiomers can also be separated by use of a chiral HPLC column.
It is also possible that the compounds of Formula I may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are included in the invention.
All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers, optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds (including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention. The chiral centers of the present invention can have the S or R configuration as defined by the IUPAC 1974 Recommendations. The use of the terms "salt", "solvate", "ester", "prodrug" and the like, is intended to equally apply to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, stereoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, racemates or prodrugs of the compounds according to the invention.
The compounds having Formula I or the pharmaceutically accepted salts may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with water, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an appropriate organic solvent. The compounds of this invention include the hydrates or solvates of the compounds listed.
In the compounds of Formula I, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of Formula I. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature.
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g., increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements) and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labelled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples herein below, by substituting an appropriate isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.
In a second aspect of the invention, the compounds according to Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be used as a medicament in therapy. More in particular, the compounds according to Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be used for the treatment of diseases or conditions caused by, or associated with increased activity of TDO, in particular diseases or disorders caused by, or associated with increased tryptophan metabolism.
In particular, the compounds of Formula I or their salts, and pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used to treat cancer.
In another embodiment, the compounds of the present invention, their salts and pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used to increase the efficacy of one or more other anti-cancer agents, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents, vaccines, antibodies, or cell therapies.
In again another aspect, the compounds of the present invention, their salts and pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used to treat or prevent the negative effects of tryptophan metabolites, which are related to increased activity of TDO, in neuropsychiatric disease, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
In yet a further embodiment, the compounds of the present invention, their salts and pharmaceutical compositions thereof can be used to treat or prevent neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's or Huntington's disease.
A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of a compound of Formula 1, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and pharmaceutical compositions thereof in the treatment of diseases, disorders and pathological conditions caused by or associated with overexpression or over-activity of the TDO protein, in particular diseases, disorders and conditions wherein an increased tryptophan degradation plays a prominent role.
Included herein are methods of treatment and/or pharmaceutical compositions in which at least one compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered as a single agent or in combination with at least one other therapeutically active agent. The other therapeutically active agent can be a chemotherapeutic agent, an antibody, engineered immune cells or an active polypeptide.
Thus, in one embodiment, the invention concerns a compound of Formula I or salt thereof in combination with one or more other drug(s).
In a third aspect, the invention further provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of Formula I and salts thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, or excipients. The carrier(s), diluent(s) or excipient(s) must be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.
Mixed with such pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, A.R. et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufacturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray.
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be presented in unit dose forms containing a predetermined amount of active ingredient per unit dose. Such a unit may contain, for example, 5 µg to 1 g, preferably 1 mg to 700 mg, more preferably 5 mg to 100 mg of a compound of the Formula I, depending on the condition being treated, the route of administration and the age, weight and condition of the patient. Such unit doses may therefore be administered more than once a day. Preferred unit dosage compositions are those containing a daily dose or sub-dose (for administration more than once a day), as here in above recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of an active ingredient. Furthermore, such pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the pharmacy art.
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for administration by any appropriate route, for example by the oral (including buccal or sublingual), rectal, topical, inhaled, nasal, ocular, sublingual, subcutaneous, local or parenteral (including intravenous and intramuscular) route, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration. Such compositions may be prepared by any method known in the art of pharmacy, for example by bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier(s) or excipient(s). Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like.
The compound of the present invention can also be administered as a protein-drug conjugate. The compound can be covalently bound, optionally with a linker molecule to a peptide or protein, such as a binding protein for example an antibody. Using this approach, the conjugate can be delivered to the target tissue. Methods to prepare such conjugates are well known to those skilled in the art.
The compound of the present invention can also be administered as a (bio)polymeric nanoparticulate-drug system (Park, W. et al., Nanomed. Nanobiotechnol. 7: 494-508; 2015). The compound can be covalently bound, optionally with a linker molecule to the nanoparticulate system for example, but not limited to, a polymeric micelle. Using this approach, the nanoparticulate can be delivered to the target tissue. Methods to prepare such nanoparticulates are well known to those skilled in the art.
It will be appreciated that when the compound of the present invention is administered in combination with other therapeutic agents normally administered by the inhaled, intravenous, oral or intranasal route, that the resultant pharmaceutical composition may be administered by the same routes.
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention will depend upon a number of factors including, for example, the age and weight of the animal, the precise condition requiring treatment and its severity, the particular compound having Formula I, the nature of the formulation, and the route of administration, and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. However, an effective amount of a compound of Formula I for the treatment of diseases or conditions associated with inappropriate TDO protein, will generally be in the range of 5 µg to 100 mg/kg body weight of recipient (mammal) per day and more usually in the range of 5 µg to 10 mg/kg body weight per day. This amount may be given in a single dose per day or more usually in a number (such as two, three, four, five or six) of sub-doses per day such that the total daily dose is the same. An effective amount of a salt or solvate, thereof, may be determined as a proportion of the effective amount of the compound of Formula I per se.
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg of a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple sub-doses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage, as well as the regimen of administration, may differ between a female and a male recipient.
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a mixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof.
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of Formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof in combination with at least one other therapeutically active agent.
For the treatment of cancer a compound of Formula I may be combined with one or more anticancer agents. Examples of such agents can be found in Cancer Principles and Practice of Oncology by V.T. Devita and S. Hellman (editors), 6th edition (February 15, 2001), Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers. A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to discern which combinations of agents would be useful based on the particular characteristics of the drugs and the cancer involved.
The 3-phenyl-1 H-indole derivatives of the present invention can be prepared by methods well known in the art of organic chemistry. See, for example, J. March, 'Advanced Organic Chemistry' 4th Edition, John Wiley and Sons. During synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This is achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wutts 'Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis' 3rd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, 1999. The protective groups are optionally removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods well known in the art.
The products of the reactions are optionally isolated and purified, if desired, using conventional techniques, including but not limited to, filtration, distillation, crystallization, chromatography and the like. Such materials are optionally characterized using conventional means, including physical constants and spectral data.

Biochemical IDO1 assay
To determine the inhibitory activity of compounds on IDO1, the NFK GreenScreen™ assay technology was used, which makes use of a chemical probe to detect NFK (Seegers, N., et al., J. Biol. Screen. 19: 1266; 2014). Compounds were serially diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and finally in IDO1 reaction buffer, consisting of 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, supplemented with 0.1 % Tween-20 (cat. No. P7949; Sigma Aldrich) and 2 % glycerol. Recombinant full-length IDO1 (Seegers, N., et al.) and all other assay components were diluted in IDO1 reaction buffer. 10 µl of compound solution, 20 µl of enzyme solution supplemented with 20 mM ascorbic acid, 20 µg/ml catalase, and 20 µM methylene blue were combined in the well of a black 384-well plate (cat. no. 3573; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, 10 µl of 0.4 mM of the substrate L-tryptophan was added, i.e., the final concentration of L-tryptophan was 100 µM. The DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.3 %. The concentration of IDO1 was 25 nM. Incubation was continued for 60 min at room temperature. Then, 10 µl of NFK Green™ (NTRC, Oss, The Netherlands) was added, the plate was sealed, and the reaction was developed for 3 hours at 37 °C. To determine the production of N-formyl kynurenine (NFK), the seal was removed and fluorescence was read on an EnVision multimode reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA). IC50 were calculated using XLfit™ software (ID Business Solutions, Ltd., Surrey, U.K.). The IC50 values of all exemplified compounds were found to be higher than 25 µM.

Cytochrome P450 assays
To determine the inhibitory potency of compounds on CYP3A4 enzyme, the P450-Glo CYP3A41uciferin isopropylacetal (Luc-IP) assay was used (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, Cat. No. V9920). The assay makes use of a luminogenic isopropylacetal (IPA) substrate that is a derivative from beetle luciferin, a substrate of luciferase enzymes. The IPA substrate is converted by CYP3A4 to luciferin, which in turn reacts with luciferase to produce an amount of light that is directly proportional to the activity of CYP3A4. Compounds were serially diluted in DMSO and finally in 400 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.4. 5 µl of compound solution and 5 µl of CYP3A4/substrate solution were combined in the well of a white 384-well Optiplate (Perkin Elmer). The DMSO concentration in the assay was 0.1 %. After incubation for 10 minutes at room temperature in the dark, 10 µl of NADPH regeneration system was added and incubation was continued for 10 min. Then, 20 µl of Luciferin Detection Reagent was added to stop the reaction, and incubation was continued for another 20 min. Luminescence was measured on an Envision multimode reader and IC50 values were calculated using XLfit™. Concentrations of enzyme, substrate and other reagents were set according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega document TB325, revision 3/15). Instead of in a 96-well plate, the assay was performed in 384-well white Perkin Elmer Optiplate (cat. no. 6007290).
A similar assay was used to determine the inhibitory potency of compounds on CYP2D6. The P450-Glo CYP2D6 Luc-IP assay (Promega; Cat. No. V9890) makes use of a luminogenic substrate (ME EGE) that is converted to luciferin by CYP2D6. This assay was performed according to the instruction of the manufacturer (Promega document TB325, revision 3/15), with the difference that it was performed in a 384-well white Perkin Elmer Optiplates (cat. no. 6007290), instead of a 96-well plate. All volumes mentioned in the manufacturer's instruction were divided by a factor 2.5. The DMSO concentration during the incubation phase of the assay was 0.1 %. The IC50 values of all exemplified compounds were found to be higher than 5 µM in both assays. Compounds of examples 16, 23, 42, 43, 45, 46, 55, 57, 61, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 81, 82, 91, 94, 102, 104, 106, 110, 117, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 128, 130 and 135 showed an IC50 value > 5 µM and < 10 µM for CYP3A4 and compounds of examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 69, 73, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 103, 105, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118, 120, 121, 127, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 137 and 138 showed an IC50 of > 10 µM for CYP3A4.
