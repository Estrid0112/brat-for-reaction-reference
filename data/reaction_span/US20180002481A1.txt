FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to the field of polymers and olefin polymerization, and more specifically olefin metathesis polymerization. Specifically, the present invention provides a polymer comprising rigorously alternating AB subunits and methods of formation of the AB alternating polymers.
BACKGROUND
Copolymers are employed in a wide range of materials, ranging from bulk plastics to specialized coatings, pharmaceutical compositions, and biomedical and electronic devices. Among the most commonly used are block copolymers, which often rely on phase separation of the two blocks for their functional properties, for example in drug delivery nanoparticles, and random copolymers, which incorporate two or more functional moieties that act co-operatively, for example in organic light emitting diodes. Regularly alternating polymers allow for controlled positioning of functional substituents, but they are difficult to access synthetically.
Regioregular alternating polymers (for example, SAN, styrene-acrylonitrile, an alternating copolymer used in plastics) are generally synthesized by radical polymerization with kinetic control of alternation in the polymerization reaction. (Hawker, C. J.; Bosman, A. W.; Harth, E. Chemical Reviews 2001, 101, 3661-3688; Matyjaszewski, K.; Xia, J. H. Chemical Reviews 2001, 101, 2921-2990). Recently, ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and ring opening insertion metathesis polymerization (ROIMP) have been employed to synthesize alternating polymers: Ilker, M. F.; Coughlin, E. B. Macromolecules 2002, 35, 54-58; Choi, T. L.; Rutenberg, I. M.; Grubbs, R. H. Angewandte Chemie-Intl. Ed. 2002, 41, 3839-3841; PCT publication WO 03/070779.
The existing methods of formation of alternating polymers are limited, and there remains a need for new and more structurally diverse substrates and polymers. The present invention provides substrate and catalyst combinations that can generate a wider range of alternating polymers, having a range of diverse properties.
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The invention provides an AB copolymer and a method for producing an alternating AB copolymer comprising the repeating unit I,
in which the A monomer is derived from a cyclobutene derivative III or III', and the B monomer is derived from a cyclohexene derivative II.
In embodiments starting from cyclobutene III, in a first step the cyclobutene III is isomerized to III' in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst.
The method comprises isomerizing the cyclobutene 1-carboxyl or 1-carbonyl derivative III to isomerized cyclobutene 1-carboxyl or 1-carbonyl derivative III' in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst. The method further comprises contacting the cyclohexene derivative II with the isomerized cyclobutene 1-carboxyl or 1-carbonyl derivative III' in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst. In certain embodiments of the invention, the cyclobutene III' is prepared separately and treated with the cyclohexene II in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst to provide the polymer I. These polymerization methods enable the facile preparation of amphiphilic and bifunctional alternating polymers from simple and readily available starting materials.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Most sequence-controlled polymers lack rigorous fidelity, e.g. the chain microstructures are not completely well controlled or they are homo polymers with simple chain microstructures or copolymers, such as random or block copolymers, in which the monomer sequence is not precisely controlled. Polymers of imprecise sequence are widely employed, but do not provide the same structural and functional complexity as sequence-controlled biopolymers created by nature. The present method provides a facile approach to prepare long and alternating AB copolymers. According to the present method, these copolymers may be formed in a single reaction mixture in which isomerization occurs first, followed by alternating ring-opening cross metathesis of type A monomer and ring opening cross metathesis of type B monomer.
Accordingly, the invention provides methods for the preparation of polymers in which the backbone chain has a regular alternating pattern of functional group arrangement. The method further allows for the preparation of copolymers having low polydispersities and long lengths.
The invention provides an alternating AB copolymer and a method for producing an alternating AB copolymer comprising the repeating unit I,
The method comprises the polymerization of cyclobutene derivative III' and cyclohexene derivative II in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst. In embodiments of the process that use the cyclobutene III, the process further comprises isomerizing a cyclobutene of structure III in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst to form a cyclobutene III' and contacting an olefin of structure II with an isomerized cyclobutene III'
in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst.

In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing an alternating AB copolymer from a monomer comprising an cyclobutene of structure IIIc or IIIc', in which the cyclobutene of structure IIIc is isomerized to a cyclobutene of structure IIIc'
in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst.
In the above structures, Rb may be, but is not limited to, H, C1-C20 alkyl, C2-C20 alkenyl, C3-C8 cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, aryl, aralkyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, C1-C20 alkenyloxy, C3-C6 cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, heterocyclyloxy, C1-C20 alkylamino, C1-C20 alkenylamino, C3-C8 cycloalkylamino, heterocyclylamino, or arylamino and may be optionally substituted with up to three substituents selected from halo, CN, NO2, oxo, amino, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aryl, and a heterocyclic group. It will be understood that m may be between 0 and 4, and that for each m, the substituent R8 may independently be, but is not limited to, aldehyde, C1-C20 alkyl, C2-C20 alkenyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocyclyl, C1-C20 alkoxy, C1-C20 acyloxy, C2-C20 alkenyloxy, C3-C6 cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, heterocyclyloxy, C1-C20 alkylamino, C2-C20 alkenylamino, C3-C8 cycloalkylamino, heterocyclylamino, arylamino, or halogen.

By way of example, suitable cyclohexene and cyclobutene species include but are not limited to the following:
It will be understood that any olefins or other functional groups in the substituents of the A and B monomers should be essentially unreactive with the metathesis catalyst under the reaction conditions, so that the metathesis polymerization involves the cyclobutene and cyclohexene double bonds exclusively, or nearly so. Generally, any carbon-carbon double bonds in R or in R1 through R6 should be trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted, or otherwise rendered unreactive with the catalyst.
Aryl, as used herein, includes but is not limited to optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and phenanthryl groups. Heterocycle and heterocyclyl refer to monocyclic and fused polycyclic heteroaromatic and heteroaliphatic ring systems containing at least one N, O, S, or P atom. Aryl and heterocyclic groups may contain from 1 to 60 carbon atoms, and may range from furan, thiophene, and benzene to large chromophores such as phthalocyanines and fullerenes. For some applications, aryl and heterocyclic groups will preferably contain from 1 to 20 carbon atoms.
It will be apparent that alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, heterocyclyl, acyl, and aryl moieties in the substituents R and R1 through R6 may be substituted with functional groups known to be compatible with the catalyst. Examples include, but are not limited to, C1-C4 acyl, acyloxy, acylamino, amido, aryloxy, alkoxy and alkylthio groups; halogens; protected amino groups such as BocNH- and FmocNH-; protected hydroxy groups such as TMSO-, BzO-, and BnO-; and protected carboxyl groups such as -CO2-t-Bu and -CO2Bn. Accordingly, the terms alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyl, acyl, aryl, and heterocyclyl as used herein encompass such substituents.
The method may be used to prepare rigorously alternating AB copolymers. In the copolymers of the present invention, an A monomer derived from a cyclobutene derivative III selected from a compound of formula III, IIIa, IIIb and IIIc alternates with a B monomer selected from a cyclohexene derivative II or IIa. In certain embodiments of the invention, the cyclobutene III is isomerized to provide the cyclobutene III' which is followed by the polymerization with the cyclohexene in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst to provide the AB polymer. These reactions may be run in a single reaction vessel.
In certain other embodiments of the invention, the cyclobutene III', IIIa', IIIb' and IIIc' is prepared separately. The cyclobutene III', IIIa', IIIb' and IIIc' is treated with the cyclohexene II or IIa in the presence of an olefin metathesis catalyst to provide the AB copolymer.
The catalyst may be any olefin metathesis catalyst known in the art, such as those disclosed in WO 03/070779. It is preferably an alkylidene ruthenium complex, and more preferably a complex of formula (L)2(L')X2Ru'CHR', wherein R' may be, for example, H, C1-C10 alkyl, C2-C10 alkenyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, or aryl. The ligand L is typically a trialkyl phosphines, triarylphosphines, tri(cycloalkyl)phosphines, pyridines, aryl, wherein aryl is optionally substituted with a halogen. L' is a second ligand, and may be a trialkyl phosphine, triarylphosphine, tri(cycloalkyl)phosphine, or a pyridine. L' may also be an imidazolin-2-ylidine carbene of formula IV:
wherein R9 may be selected from the group, but is not limited to a C1-C6 alkyl group or aryl. In certain embodiments, X is a halogen or pseudohalogen such as F, Cl, Br, NO3, CF3, or CF3COO−.
In certain embodiments, L is a pyridine, optionally 3-bromopyridine; and L' is an imidazolin-2-ylidine carbene. In another embodiment, R9 is preferably mesityl, 2-methylphenyl, 2-ethylphenyl, 2-isopropylphenyl, 2,3-diisopropylphenyl, 2, 6-difluorophenyl, or 3,5-di-t-butylphenyl.
The polymers of the present invention may be prepared according to the representative Scheme 1.
We tested the corresponding bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxamides 1a-f in ROMP reactions with the Grubbs III catalyst 2 (Scheme 1). Surprisingly, under ROMP conditions, each of the amides 1 isomerized to the bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(8)-ene-8-carboxamide 1'. None of the amides showed evidence of homopolymerization in the presence of catalyst 2.
On the other hand, addition of cyclohexene 3 to isomerized amides 1' in the presence of catalyst 2 provided a reaction manifold for the isomerized amides that led to linear, alternating copolymers, poly(1'-alt-3), of impressive length. We now refer to this tandem reaction as i-AROMP for isomerization, alternating ring-opening metathesis polymerization.
Alternatively, bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(8)-ene-8-carboxamides can be prepared from bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(8)-ene-8-carboxylic acids prepared by methods known in the art. See (i) Fleming, I.; Harley-Mason, J.

EXAMPLES
The following examples further illustrate the invention, but should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any way.
All metathesis reactions were performed under an N2 atmosphere. Solvents, e.g. CH2Cl2 and THF were purified with Pure Process Technology (PPT). Deuterated solvents for all ring-opening reactions were degassed and filtered through basic alumina before use. Catalyst Cl2(H2IMes)(PCy3)Ru═CHPh was purchased from Aldrich. Cyclohexene-D10 was purchased from CDN Isotope Inc. The synthesis of catalyst (3-Br-Pyr)2Cl2(H2IMes)Ru═CHPh, 2, was performed according to the procedure of Love et al. (Love, J. A.; Morgan, J. P.; Trnka, T. M.; Grubbs, R. H. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 4035-4037). Experimental procedures for the preparation of amides 1 and 4 are below.
Solvents, e.g. CH2Cl2 and THF were purified with Pure Process Technology (PPT). Mallinckrodt silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) was used for column chromatography. Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated silica gel plates (60F254), flash chromatography on silica gel-60 (230-400 mesh), and Combi-Flash chromatography on RediSep normal phase silica columns (silica gel-60, 230-400 mesh). Bruker Nanobay 400, Avance III 500, Avance III 700 NMR instruments were used for analysis. Chemical shifts were calibrated from residual undeuterated solvents; they are denoted in ppm (δ). Molecular weights and molar-mass dispersities except poly(1c'-alt-3)424 were measured with a gel phase chromatography system constructed from a Shimadzu pump coupled to a Shimadzu UV detector. THF served as the eluent with a flow rate of 0.700 mL/min on a Phenogel 5μ MXL GPC column (105 Da exclusion limit), Phenomenex. The dispersity of poly(1c'-alt-3)424 was measured on a size exclusion chromatography system constructed from a GPCmax VE-2001 pump coupled to a model 305 TDA detector. CHCl3 served as the eluent with a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min on a TSKgel GMHHR-H(S) column (13 μm, 4×108 exclusion limit). Both GPCs were calibrated with poly(styrene) standards at 30° C. The Tg was measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a Perkin-Elmer DSC-7 thermal analysis system (Shelton, Conn., USA), at a scan rate of 10° C./min. Polymer samples (each weighing approx. 1.2 mg) were sealed in aluminum cassettes under dry conditions.
Example 1: Synthesis of Monomers
Bicyclo[4.2.0] and [3.2.0] esters were synthesized by a modification of Snider's approach (Snider, B. B.; Rodini, D. J.; Cionn, R. S. E.; Sealfon, S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979, 101, 5283-5493) as previously described. (Tan, L.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. Macromolecules 2014, 47, 6572-6579). Basic hydrolysis provided the carboxylic acids that were coupled to selected amines to yield amides 1a-1e and 4. Diastereomers 1f and 1f* were prepared from the mixture of racemic bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxylic acid and (5)-phenylglycinol, separated, and then, individually acylated. Relative stereochemistry was not assigned to the diastereomers.
Example 2: Attempted ROMP of Bicycloamides: Discovery of Isomerization
We submitted the bicyclo[4.2.0] amides 1 to ROMP conditions with catalyst 2 in CDCl3 and monitored the reactions by 1H NMR. The bicyclic monomers underwent rapid reactions. The olefinic proton signals at ˜6.7 ppm disappeared or nearly disappeared (FIGS. 57a and b) within 15 minutes to 24 hours (Table 1, entries 1-7). However, no polymerization could be detected. In contrast, when amide 4 was stirred with catalyst 2 for 18 hours at 25° C., only a 2% decrease in the intensity of the olefinic resonance was observed.
The products derived from monomers 1c and 1d were selected for further study. Purification yielded compounds 1c' and 1d' with molecular masses identical to those of the starting materials. The spectroscopic signatures of 1c' and 1d' were distinct from those of 1c and 1d indicating that isomerization had occurred. Relative to the 1 H NMR spectra of the starting materials, those of 1c' and 1d' contained one more methylene proton signal, one less methine signal, and no olefinic proton resonance (FIGS. 57 and 1). Further spectroscopic characterization of 1c' by HSQC NMR spectroscopy indicated that it retains the unsaturated bicyclic structure of 1c, but that the double bond had migrated (Scheme 1 and FIGS. 2-3).

Typically, tetra-substituted olefins are not obtained with catalyst 2. (Stewart, I. C.; Ung, T.; Pletnev, A. A.; Berlin, J. M.; Grubbs, R. H.; Schrodi, Y. Org. Lett. 2007, 9, 1589-1592; Berlin, J. M.; Campbell, K.; Ritter, T.; Funk, T. W.; Chlenov, A.; Grubbs, R. H. Org. Lett. 2007, 9, 1339-1342; Rost, D.; Porta, M.; Gessler, S.; Blechert, S. Tetrahedron Lett. 2008, 49, 5968-5971; Ackermann, L.; Fürstner, A.; Weskamp, T.; Kohl, F. J.; Herrmann, W. A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 4787-4790). In our system, further isomerization to the bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(2)-ene-8-carboxamide is unfavorable because in this compound the alkene is not in conjugation with the amide. We observed that the bicyclo[3.2.0] system 4 does not undergo appreciable isomerization. As noted above, regioisomer 4' is not formed upon addition of catalyst 2 to amide 4.
Example 3: Mechanism of Isomerization
Control experiments support the role of species 2 as the isomerization catalyst. No isomerization was observed upon incubation of 1c in CH2Cl2 at 35° C. for 16 hours in the absence of catalyst 2. Over the course of our experiments, we utilized four different batches of 2. All four preparations of 2 catalyzed isomerization to the same extent and at the same rate. Furthermore, addition of 50 equivalents of 3-bromopyridine to amide 1e and catalyst 2 reduced the percentage of isomerization 3-fold over a 14-hour time period as compared to isomerization in the absence of exogenous 3-bromopyridine ([2]=0.005 M, Table 1, entry 8 vs 9). Likewise, we found that 20 mol % of (Cl)2(H2IMes)(PCy3)Ru═CHPh, for which PCy3 ligand dissociation is less favored, catalyzed less than 5% isomerization of amide 1e in 14 hours as compared to 100% conversion with 20 mol % catalyst 2 within 1 hour (Table 1, entry 10 vs 11). These experiments indicate that coordination of the substrate to the Ru catalyst is involved in the isomerization.
Cyclobutenes are sensitive to acid-catalyzed decomposition and/or reaction. In order to exclude the possibility that substrates 1 were being converted to isomers 1' by adventitious acid, we repurified the monomers by passing them through dry basic alumina before subjecting them to catalyst 2. The isomerization rates and product distributions were unchanged.
Ruthenium catalysts promote olefin isomerization. Previous reports (Cadot, C.; Dalko, P. I.; Cossy, J. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 1839-1841; Dinger, M. B.; Mol, J. C. Organometallics 2003, 22, 1089-1095; Dinger, M. B.; Mol, J. C. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 2003, 2827-2833; Schmidt, B. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2004, 2004, 1865-1880) have proposed that either a Ru hydride species (McGrath, D. V.; Grubbs, R. H. Organometallics 1994, 13, 224-235; Bourgeois, D.; Pancrazi, A.; Nolan, S. P.; Prunet, J. J. Organomet. Chem. 2002, 643-644, 247-252; van Rensburg, W. J.; Steynberg, P. J.; Meyer, W. H.; Kirk, M. M.; Forman, G. S. J Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 14332-14333; van Rensburg, W. J.; Steynberg, P. J.; Kirk, M. M.; Meyer, W. H.; Forman, G. S. J. Organometallic Chem. 2006, 691, 5312-5325; Ashworth, I. W.; Hillier, I. H.; Nelson, D. J.; Percy, J. M.; Vincent, M. A. Eur. J Org. Chem. 2012, 2012, 5673-5677) or a π-allyl Ru complex (McGrath, D. V.; Grubbs, R. H. Organometallics 1994, 13, 224-235; Bourgeois, D.; Pancrazi, A.; Nolan, S. P.; Prunet, J. Organomet. Chem. 2002, 643-644, 247-252; Higman, C. S.; Plais, L.; Fogg, D. E. Chem. Cat. Chem 2013, 5, 3548-3551; Schmidt, B. J. Mol. Catal. A: Chem. 2006, 254, 53-57; Trost, B. M.; Kulawiec, R. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 2027-2036) is responsible. The Ru hydride can form upon decomposition that occurs with extended reaction times or extreme reaction conditions. (Dinger, M. B.; Mol, J. C. Organometallics 2003, 22, 1089-1095; Dinger, M. B.; Mol, J. C. Eur. J. Inorg. Chem. 2003, 2003, 2827-2833). The rapid isomerization rates we observe are inconsistent with the formation of a Ru hydride species through decomposition of 2. Moreover, we did not observed Ru hydride resonances at the expected upheld region between 0 and −30 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra of the above reactions. Addition of 1,4-benzoquinone, which has been reported to oxidize Ru hydride species and prevent olefin isomerization, (Hong, S. H.; Sanders, D. P.; Lee, C. W.; Grubbs, R. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 17160-17161), to our amide le did not suppress isomerization. Therefore, a reduced, electron-rich species is unlikely to be responsible for initiation of isomerization (Table 1, entry 8 vs 12).
Alcohols can act as ruthenium reducing agents to enhance Ru hydride formation. (Higman, C. S.; Plais, L.; Fogg, D. E. Chem. Cat. Chem 2013, 5, 3548-3551). However, their coordination with Ru can suppress isomerization that proceeds via a π-allyl mechanism. (Schmidt, B. J. Mol. Catal. A: Chem. 2006, 254, 53-57; Bielawski, C.; Scherman, O.; Grubbs, R. Polymer 2001, 42, 4939-4945; Hillmyer, M. A.; Nguyen, S. T.; Grubbs, R. H. Macromolecules 1997, 30, 718-721). Therefore, we tested isomerization of 1c with and without methanol in the presence of 10 mol % catalyst 2. The 1c isomerization reaction containing 8% methanol in CD2Cl2 proceeded much more slowly than the reaction without methanol; only 65% isomerization was observed over 24 hours as compared to complete isomerization in 1.5 hours in the absence of methanol (Table 1, entry 13 vs 14). Our observations are consistent with isomerization via a π-allyl Ru complex formed upon coordination of amide 1 with catalyst 2. Evidence in hand does not distinguish between direct formation of this species from amide 1 or its formation by a “ring-walking” mechanism. (Curran, K.; Risse, W.; Hamill, M.; Saunders, P.; Muldoon, J.; Asensio de la Rosa, R.; Tritto, I. Organometallics 2012, 31, 882-889).
The isomerization rate depends on the nature of the amide nitrogen substituent: 1d>1c>1e>1b>1a>1f/1f*. The rate is slower for amides of α-substituted amines and for amides of amines that include an ester in the alkyl chain.
To investigate further the electronic influence on isomerization, we undertook a control experiment to establish the amount of isomerization with the corresponding methyl bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxylate. When subjected to catalyst 2 (2 mol %) at 50° C. for 2 days, the ester underwent ROM without isomerization as judged by the disappearance of the catalyst alkylidene proton signal and the remaining signals for the ester starting material. Therefore, the amide moiety assists rapid equilibration of isomers of 1 in the presence of 2.
Without being limited by theory, the kinetic data taken together with the structure-activity data strongly support a mechanism in which equilibration of regioisomers takes place via initial coordination involving the amide functional group and subsequent formation of a transient Ru π-allyl species.
Example 4: Alternating Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization of i-Amides
We monitored the isomerization of amide 1e to amide 1e' in the presence of 1 equivalent of catalyst 2 by 13C NMR spectroscopy. In addition to the growth of the signals corresponding to the formation of amide 1e', remarkably we observed the appearance of new peaks at 322.3 and 178.5 ppm, presumably representing the carbene carbon and the amide carbon respectively in the [Ru]═C(R)CONHR' species (FIG. 4). We also observed a peak at 315.5, representing a second ruthenium carbene species. On the basis of this experiment, we concluded, much to our surprise since monomer 1e' is a tetra-substituted alkene, that ROM occurs upon formation of 1'. Unlike the ruthenium carbenes from amide-substituted cyclobutenes, previously studied in our laboratory, (Lee, J. C.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 4578-9; Song, A.; Lee, J. C.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 10513-10520) the amide-substituted carbene derived from 1' does not undergo metathesis with remaining monomer, as noted above.
We reasoned that the amide-substituted carbene derived from 1' might undergo ring-opening cross-metathesis with cyclohexene 3, in a reaction analogous, but not identical, to the reaction of Ru enoic carbenes in our previous AROMP work. (Song, A.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 3444-3445; Lee, J. C.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 4578-9; Romulus, J.; Tan, L.; Weck, M.; Sampson, N. S. Macromol. Lett. 2013, 2, 749-752; Tan, L.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. Macromolecules 2014, 47, 6572-6579). Indeed, copolymer was rapidly formed upon addition of cyclohexene 3 (Table 2). The copolymerization of monomer 1c' or 1d' with 3, yields a 50-AB-mer in approximately 2 hours. Remarkably, in light of the steric hindrance in the system, this AROMP is faster under similar conditions than that of the less hindered 1-cyclobutene carboxylic methyl ester/cyclohexene AROMP which yields a 50-AB-mer in 3 hours (Song, A.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 3444-3445) and that of the corresponding bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxylic ester which yields a 50-AB-mer in 8 hours. (Tan, L.; Parker, K. A.; Sampson, N. S. Macromolecules 2014, 47, 6572-6579).
1H NMR spectroscopy of the copolymers displayed two alkene signals consistent with product from AROMP of isomer 1'. In contrast, AROMP of the original amide 1 would have given copolymer for which the NMR spectrum displayed three alkene signals (Scheme 1).
In order to investigate the possibility of AROMP of the original amide 1c, we premixed cyclohexene 3 with catalyst 2 before addition of amide. However, no polymer resonances were detected before a significant amount of amide 1c had isomerized to amide 1c'. Furthermore, the polymer obtained was identical to poly(1c'-alt-3)10 as judged by comparison of the 1H NMR spectra. Therefore, isomerization of 1c is faster than ROM, and thus faster than ROMP or AROMP of 1c. Likewise, in the case of amide 1d, isomerization to amide 1d' was complete before polymer appeared.
In the cases of 1a, 1b, 1e, and one of the diastereomers of 1f/1f*, we obtained mixtures of starting materials and alternating polymers. In these systems, then, the rate of isomerization is slower than or similar to the rate of ROM. Owing to their fast isomerization and polymerization, amides 1c' and 1d' were selected for the further characterization of their AROMP products. Polymers poly(1c'-alt-3)97, poly(1c'-alt-3)424, and poly(1d'-alt-3)50 were fully characterized.
Analysis of poly(1d'-alt-3)50 by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, APT and HSQC spectroscopy revealed that the polymer backbone has four alkene carbons and two alkene hydrogens corresponding to C1-C4 and H1 and H4 (Scheme 1, FIG. 5). HSQC spectroscopy confirmed that the amide-substituted olefin is a single stereoisomer; there is a single H1 signal, at 6.29 ppm that correlates with C1 at 136 ppm (FIG. 2). On the basis of comparison of the H1 alkene chemical shift with model compounds, we conclude that the conjugated alkene is of E-configuration. A single H4 signal at 5.11 ppm correlates with C4 at 121 ppm. Because of peak broadening in the polymer, we could not determine if the C3-C4 alkene is stereoregular.
Integration of the poly(1'-alt-3)n alkene signals relative to side chain signals demonstrated that an equal incorporation of the two monomers had occurred. An AA or BB dyad would be formed upon backbiting. Additional alkene proton resonances in the 5 ppm region of the 1H NMR spectrum which would indicate formation of BB dyad were not observed. In the i-AROMP product, the AA dyad does not possess an alkene proton. Therefore, we inspected the 13C NMR spectra of poly(1d'-alt-3)50 and poly(1c'-alt-3)424 for the presence of AA dyad alkene resonances, specifically, a C3' resonance between 160-145 ppm, and found none (FIG. 6). Further evidence for the equal incorporation of monomers 1d' and 3 was obtained with experiments with cyclohexene-D10. The 1H NMR spectra of the deuterium labeled copolymer poly(1d'-alt-3-D10)10 show a complete loss of the alkene resonances at 6.3 ppm and 5.1 ppm as expected for an alternating AB polymer (FIG. 7).

We explored the utility of alternating copolymerization by testing the maximal length of alternating copolymer that could be prepared. When cyclohexene 3 was added directly to a completed isomerization reaction of 1c' or 1d', poly(1c'-alt-3)50 or poly(1d'-alt-3)50 was obtained (Table 2). However, the dispersities exceeded those expected from the monomer:-catalyst ratio for a ruthenium-catalyzed polymerization, presumably because of loss of catalyst during isomerization. Therefore, in order to facilitate characterization of polymers longer than 100 AB dyads, to maximize their purity, and to minimize their dispersity, we isolated amides 1' before initiation of the AROMP reaction and added fresh catalyst.
In the case of amides 1a' and 1b', the AROMP reactions provided maximal lengths of 100 AB dyads and 260 AB dyads, respectively; with modest DM=1.1-1.2. Higher monomer feed ratios did not provide longer copolymers. In contrast, when amide 1c' was mixed with catalyst 2 in a ratio of 500:1 with 1000 equivalents of cyclohexene 3, we reproducibly obtained alternating copolymer with more than 400 AB dyads (FIG. 57c) and a modest molecular weight distribution (DM=1.2). Although the isomerization of 1d to 1d' was facile, the length of the copolymers obtained was limited to 50 AB dyads regardless of whether amide 1d' or 1d was used to initiate propagation. Finally, amides 1e' and if provided only short alternating copolymers that were not characterized further. Overall propagation efficiencies in order are 1c'>1b'>1a'>1d'>1e'>1f'. Thus, the maximal length of copolymer obtained depends on the degree of steric congestion a to the amide. Moreover, the presence of an aromatic ring in the amide substituent (1d' or 1e') significantly reduced propagation efficiency.
Given the unique polymer backbone generated in the i-AROMP reaction, the thermostability of poly(1c'-alt-3)was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in air. The Tg of poly(1c'-alt-3)97 is 86° C.±0.7° C. and it has a Td10=130° C. (5 wt %). Decomposition of poly(1c'-alt-3)424 occurred before the glass transition could be achieved. The high Tg of poly(1c'-alt-3)97 can be ascribed to its relatively rigid backbone, the large size of the amide substituents, and expected strength of the intermolecular interactions.
Conclusions.
Bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxamides of primary amines are quantitatively isomerized to bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(8)-ene-8-carboxamides in the presence of catalyst 2. Moreover, reaction of compound 1d to give 1d', which is complete within 15 minutes, is by far the fastest ruthenium-catalyzed olefin isomerization reported to date. This isomerization of an internal olefin in a bicyclic system provides a facile approach to synthesize tetra-substituted bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-1(8)-ene-8-carboxamides.
Remarkably, bicyclic tetra-substituted α, β-unsaturated amides are excellent AROMP substrates for the preparation of long, alternating copolymers. Isomerized unsaturated amides 1a', 1b', 1c' and 1d' undergo alternating ROMP with cyclohexene 1.5-4 times more rapidly than previously studied 1-cyclobutenecarboxylic acid esters or bicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene-7-carboxylic esters. The isomerized amide AROMP reaction is compatible with a variety of amides that provide functional group handles. This facile sequence, isomerization followed by alternating ring-opening cross metathesis of A and ring-opening cross metathesis of B, provides an efficient entry to well-controlled architectures, enables the production of linear, soluble, and impressively long (greater than 100 and up to 400 AB units) alternating polymers with superior monomer economics, and unlocks the prospect of employing functionalized alternating and sequence-specific copolymers in multiple applications.
General Information
General Procedure for NMR Scale Isomerization Reactions.
Under an N2 atmosphere, a solution of the original amide and catalyst 2 was prepared in the indicated solvent (600 μL) in an NMR tube and NMR spectra were acquired at 35° C. At the end of the isomerization reaction (after complete consumption or no further isomerization of amide as judged by the change of the olefinic proton resonance), each reaction was terminated with ethyl vinyl ether (100 μL) and stirred for 30 min. The solvent was evaporated and the resulting residue was purified by silica chromatography to isolate the isomerized amide.
i-[4.2.0] Amide 1a'.
Amide 1a (28 mg, 120 20 equiv) and catalyst 2 (5.3 mg, 6 μmol, 1 equiv) were mixed in CD2Cl2 in an NMR tube for 16 h; during this time, the integral for the olefinic proton decreased to 10% of its original value. The mixture was concentrated and the product was isolated by chromatography (100:1/CH2Cl2:MeOH) to yield 24 mg (80%) of 1a'. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.99 (s, 1H, CONH), 4.68 (m, 1H, CH), 3.78 (s, 3H, OCH3), 2.88 (dd, J=12.2, 6.7 Hz, 1H, CH2), 2.73 (ddd, J=15.4, 7.6, 3.9 Hz, 1H, CH2), 2.38 (m, 1H, CH), 2.24 (m, 1H, CH2), 2.10 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.94 (m, 1H, CH2), 1.75 (m, 1H, CH2), 1.45 (dt, J=18.6, 9.3 Hz, 3H, CH3), 1.34 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.16 (m, 1H, CH2).

The mixture was concentrated and the product was isolated by chromatography (100:1/CH2Cl2:MeOH) to yield 49 mg (85%) of 1c'. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 5.50 (s, 1H, CONH), 3.21 (m, 2H, side chain CH2), 2.81 (dd, J=13.4, 2.7 Hz, 1 Hz, CH2), 2.65 (dt, J=12.0, 3.8 Hz, 1H, CH2), 2.31 (m, 1H, CH), 2.15 (m, 1H, CH2), 2.04 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.89 (m, 1H, CH2), 1.69 (m, 2H, side chain CH2), 1.51 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.27 (m, 2H, CH2), 0.91 (t, J=7.5 Hz, 3H, CH3). 13C NMR (126 MHz, CD2Cl2): δ 164.1 (CONH), 161.7 (═C), 126.7 (═CCONH), 40.4 (side chain CH2), 37.6 (CH), 33.9 (CH2), 32.8 (CH2), 27.1 (CH2), 26.6 (CH2), 24.5 (CH2), 22.9 (side chain CH2), 11.3 (CH3).

A 0.01 M fresh solution of catalyst 2 in 600 μL CD2Cl2 was divided into two NMR tubes, a 50 μL aliquot of MeOH (in large excess relative to catalyst 2) was added to one tube, and a 50 μL aliquot of CD2Cl2 was added to the second tube, both tubes were stirred for 2 h. Monomer 1c (10 equiv in 250 μL CD2Cl2) was added to each tube, and the kinetics of isomerization were monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Amide 1d (23 mg, 120 μmol) and catalyst 2 (5.3 mg, 6 μmol) were mixed in CD2Cl2 in an NMR tube; after 20 min, isomerization was complete.

General Procedure for NMR Scale AROMP Reactions.
All kinetic experiments were performed at least twice, and preparative polymerization experiments were performed three times. Under an N2 atmosphere, a solution of amide 1 in CD2Cl2 (300 μL) was added to the NMR tube. Then 300 μL of catalyst 2 solution was added to the NMR tube. After complete mixing of the solution, NMR spectra were acquired at 35° C. Cyclohexene 3 was added after the amide was completely converted to its tetrasubstituted isomer as judged by the disappearance of the olefinic proton resonance around 6.7 ppm. This procedure was used for the preparation of polymers with up to 50 AB repeats. To ensure narrow dispersities, in the preparation of longer alternating polymers, the isomer 1' was isolated and mixed with fresh catalyst 2 in CD2Cl2. Cyclohexene 3 was added after catalyst 2 completely initiated as determined by the disappearance of the Ru alkylidene resonance at 19.1 ppm in the 1H NMR spectrum. When the propagation stopped or the isomerized amide disappeared as judged by a complete upfield shift of the amide N-H resonance from ˜5.4 ppm to ˜6 ppm, the reaction was quenched with ethyl vinyl ether and stirred for 30 min. The solvent was evaporated, and alternating copolymer was purified by step chromatography (100% CH2Cl2 to remove contaminants, then 20:1/CH2Cl2:MeOH to elute copolymer). The theoretical Mntheor was calculated from the monomer:catalyst feed ratio.
