[Technical Field]
The present invention relates to medicaments for preventing or treating diseases involving a pathogenic amyloid.
[Background Art]
Usually, proteins are each folded to form the specific native structure thereof, thereby exerting biological functions. When the proteins are misfolded, however, they may aggregate to form β-sheet-rich fibers (i.e., to form amyloid). Aggregates (e.g., oligomers, proto-fibrils, fibers) produced through this amyloid formation are known to cause various dysfunctions (these disorders are generally referred to as "amyloid diseases"). Here, 20 or more proteins have been identified as substances responsible for the amyloid diseases. Example of such amyloid known include: amyloid β, tau protein in Alzheimer's disease; α-synuclein in Parkinson's disease; amylin in diabetes mellitus; transthyretin in systemic amyloidosis; and huntingtin in Huntington's disease.
For example, as for amyloid β (abbreviated to Aβ), which is a causative amyloid of Alzheimer's disease, inhibitors of enzymes mediating the production of Aβ from a precursor protein, promoters of Aβ-degrading enzymes, immunotherapy, Aβ aggregation inhibitors, and the like are known as strategies to develop therapeutic drugs targeting these pathogenic amyloids.
On the other hand, it has been reported as to Aβ that a Met-oxidized form of an Aβ peptide (the sulfur atom of the Met residue is oxidized to sulfoxide (-S=O-)) remains in a small amount in vivo, and the Met-oxidized form is less aggregable as compared with the native Aβ peptide (Non Patent Literatures 1 to 3). From these viewpoints, the present inventors reported that oxidized forms of Aβ peptides are obtained by the oxidation of the Aβ peptides using a flavin photocatalyst having an Aβ-binding site represented by the formula (a), and these oxidized forms of Aβ peptides suppress the aggregation of Aβ (Non Patent Literature 4).

[Summary of Invention]
[Technical Problem]
The flavin photocatalyst used in Non Patent Literature 4 described above, however, has oxidative activity even in the absence of Aβ. This flavin photocatalyst might therefore react nonspecifically in vivo and has thus been difficult to apply in vivo, though applicable in vitro. In addition, the flavin photocatalyst could be applied only to Aβ peptides.
Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide: a compound useful as an amyloid oxidation catalyst which is applicable in vivo, is selective to amyloids and is applicable not only to Aβ peptides but to other amyloids; and a prophylactic or therapeutic drug for an amyloid-related disease, comprising the same.
[Solution to Problem]
Accordingly, the present inventors conducted various studies to develop a catalyst which has selective oxidative activity against amyloids and is applicable in vivo, and consequently completed the present invention by finding that a boron-dipyrrin complex, which is represented by the following formula (1), having a halogen atom or a halogenoalkyl group on the boron atom exhibits strong oxygenation activity on an Aβ peptide and other amyloids; the complex exhibits particularly strong oxygenation activity on very toxic Aβ peptide aggregates; the complex exhibits little oxygenation activity on peptides other than amyloid; and the complex is highly stable in water and/or under light irradiation, and that the boron-dipyrrin complex represented by the following formula (1) is useful as an in vivo catalyst which yields oxidized forms of amyloids having no aggregability. Further, a portion of the boron-dipyrrin complex represented by the following formula (1) (wherein R1 is hydrogen or alkyl) emits strong fluorescence upon light irradiation and is very stable in water and/or under light irradiation conditions. Thus, the portion is found to be useful as a fluorescent dye in vivo and/or in tissues or as an intermediate for the manufacture of the compound represented by formula (1). In this way, the present inventors have completed the present invention.

The compound is represented by the following formula (1A):
(In the formula, X1, X2, R2 to R10 are the same as above.)
A compound in which R1 is a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group emits strong fluorescence and is thus useful as a fluorescent dye which emits fluorescence to stain a living body, tissues, cells, etc. The compound is represented by the following formula (1B):

When the present compound (1) has an asymmetric carbon atom, an enantiomer may be present and the enantiomer and a racemate are both included in the present invention.
The present compound (1) may be produced in accordance with, for example, the following reaction scheme.
(In the scheme, X1, X2, R4, R5, R8, R9, and R10 are the same as above.)
First, a pyrrole compound (2) is reacted with a triethyl orthoformate compound in the presence of an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid to give a compound (3). For example, acetic acid other than trifluoroacetic acid may be used as the acid. This reaction may be performed in an inert solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, or dichloroethane at 0 to 50°C for 10 min to 10 hours.
Next, the compound (3) is reacted with a halogenoalkyl-modified trihalogenoboron (e.g., KBF3CF3, KBF3C2F5) to give a compound (1B1). In this reaction, the compound (3) is first reacted with an organic amine such as triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane. The resultant was reacted at 0°C with, for example, an acetonitrile suspension containing a halogenoalkyl-modified trihalogenoboron and a Lewis acid such as trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TMSOTf). After that, the reaction may be conducted at 0°C to room temperature for 1 to 10 hours.
Then, the compound (1B1) is reacted with a halogen such as iodine to give a compound (1B2). The iodination is preferably performed using an iodination agent such as diacetoxy iodobenzene and iodine. Note that the reaction may be conducted in a polar solvent such as acetonitrile at room temperature for 1 to 10 hours.
After that, the compound (1B2) is reacted with a compound (4) to give a compound (1A). This reaction may be carried out in the presence of an acid such as acetic acid and an organic amine such as piperidine in an inert solvent such as toluene at 100 to 200°C for 1 to 10 hours. In this reaction, an iodine atom is considered to detach from the boron-dipyrrin ring of the compound (1B2).
Note that the compound (4) may be produced, for example, by performing a Vilsmeier-Haack reaction where a tetrahydroquinoline compound is reacted with dimethylformamide and phosphoryl trichloride to formylate the tetrahydroquinoline compound at position 6.
Regarding a substituent on the dipyrrin structure, various kinds of the substituent of a starting material pyrrole compound may be used for appropriate substitution.
In addition, the compound (1A) wherein R8 is -(CH2)l-CONH-(CH2)n-Z may be obtained by the reaction using H2N(CH2)n-Z and, as a starting material, the compound (4) wherein R8 is - (CH2)l-COOH.
The present compound (1) as so obtained may be isolated and purified from a reaction mixture by using conventional techniques such as washing, crystallization, recrystallization, and chromatography.
The maximum light absorption wavelength of the present compound (1A) is shifted to the long-wavelength side when compared to that of thioflavin T. It was observed that regarding the present compound (1A) placed in the presence of Aβ, the light absorption wavelength was shifted a little more to the long-wavelength side than in the absence of Aβ and the compound exhibited remarkably high fluorescence. These results demonstrate that like thioflavin T, the present compound is bound to Aβ to inhibit an intramolecular rotation, which results in fluorescence emission.
In addition, when the present compound (1A) was added to native Aβ and was irradiated with light with a wavelength of 590 nm or more under physiological conditions, the amount of native Aβ decreased over time so as to increase the amount of oxygenated Aβ to which one to four oxygen atoms were added. The oxygenation efficiency was remarkably higher than that of thioflavin T. Also, the oxygenation reaction catalyzed by the present compound (1A) is selective for Aβ such that its selectivity is very weak with respect to non-amyloid peptides (e.g., angiotensin IV, methionine enkephalin).
Further, the present compound (1A) had higher oxygenation activity on very toxic aggregated peptides than toward Aβ peptide monomers. Furthermore, the present compound (1A) has superior stability to water and stability under light irradiation conditions.
Hence, the present compound (1A) should work as a catalyst which helps selectively oxygenate pathogenic amyloids such as Aβ peptide, amylin, transthyretin, α-synuclein, tau protein, and huntingtin. Once oxygenated, such a pathogenic amyloid cannot form a stacked β-sheet structure, so that its pathogenicity does not occur. Thus, the present compound (1A) is useful as a drug for preventing and/or treating diseases involving a pathogenic amyloid, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, diabetes mellitus, Huntington's disease, and systemic amyloidosis in animal including a human.
The present compound (1A) catalyzes a reaction in which a pathogenic amyloid is oxygenated. This oxygenation reaction proceeds such that the present compound (1A) is excited by light exposure and is thus activated to oxygenate amyloid. Because of this, when the present compound (1A) is used as a medicament, a patient is preferably irradiated with light after the present compound (1A) is administered. In addition, the light wavelength which enables the present compound (1A) to be under an excited state is a long-wavelength of 590 nm or more. Light with this characteristic wavelength is easy to permeate through a living body.
Meanwhile, examples of the amino acid residue in the amyloid that is oxygenated due to the action of the present compound (1A) include a methionine residue having a sulfur atom and a histidine residue having an imidazole ring.
A pharmaceutical composition comprising the present compound (1A) may be prepared, in accordance with a variety of formulation preparation processes, by selecting an appropriate formulation depending on an administration method and by using a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Examples of a dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition comprising, as a main ingredient, the present compound (1A) can include oral preparations such as a tablet, a powder, a granule, a capsule, a liquid, a syrup, an elixir, and an oily or aqueous suspension).
An injection may contain a stabilizer, a preservative, and/or a dissolution aid in a preparation. A solution which may contain such pharmaceutical aids may be placed in a container and provided, for example, as a lyophilized solid preparation, which will be prepared upon use. In addition, a single dose may be contained in a container. Also, multiple doses may be contained in a container.
Meanwhile, examples of an external preparation thereof include a liquid, a suspension, an emulsion, an ointment, a gel, a cream, a lotion, a spray, and a patch.
A solid preparation may contain the present compound (1A) and a pharmaceutically acceptable additive. Examples of the additive include fillers, thickeners, binders, disintegrants, solubilization enhancers, wetting agents, and lubricants. These additives may be selected, as needed, and mixed for formulation.
Examples of a liquid preparation thereof include a solution, a suspension, and an emulsion. The liquid preparation may contain, as an additive, a suspending agent and/or an emulsifying agent.
The present compound (1A) may be used as a human medicament. In this case, an adult daily dose ranges from 1 mg to 1 g and preferably from 1 mg to 300 mg.

Test Example 1 (Stability to water)
Phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) in which compound 8, 10, 11, or 12 (each 20 µM) had been dissolved were incubated at 37°C and the time course of each light absorption spectrum was determined.
The results are shown in Figure 1. As is clear from Figure 1, the present compounds in which the boron was substituted with trihalogenoalkyl group had a high stability to water.
Test Example 2 (Optical Properties and Stability under Light Irradiation Conditions)
The optical properties (in methanol) of compounds 2 to 4 synthesized were determined (Table 1). The compounds 2 to 4 each have maximum absorption at a wavelength at or near 500 nm and emit fluorescence at 509 nm. It was observed that introduction of a perfluoroalkyl group caused some decreases in light absorption coefficients, but little change in their fluorescence quantum yield. This result has demonstrated that the perfluoroalkyl group on the boron atom does not considerably affect the optical properties of the present compounds.

Next, a methanol solution containing each of compounds 2 to 4 was irradiated with light of 500 nm, and incubated at 37°C. Then, a change in the time course of the absorbance at the maximum light absorption wavelength was measured to compare their photostability (Figure 2). Compound 2 resulted in substantial photofading after about 30 min. By contrast, compounds 3 and 4, having a perfluoroalkyl group, took 2 hours or longer until complete photofading. That is, it was suggested that the present compounds having a perfluoroalkyl group on the boron atom should be more significantly stable against light than the compound having two fluorine atoms on the boron atom. Reaction with singlet oxygen seems to be primarily responsible for the photofading under visible light irradiation. So, the photostability of the present compounds was considered from the viewpoint of the reactivity with singlet oxygen. First, the HOMO/LUMO levels of compounds 2 to 4 were calculated in accordance with a DFT algorithm (Figure 3). The calculation results demonstrated that the HOMO/LUMO levels decreased in the order of F > CF3 > C2F5, which were a substituent on the boron atom. As the HOMO level increases, the compounds are more susceptible to oxygenation by singlet oxygen. Thus, this calculation results agree with the results of the photostability test. In addition, the three compounds exhibited almost no difference with respect to the HOMO-LUMO energy gap. This reflects the fact that the maximum absorption wavelength is unchanged.
Test Example 3
Each absorption spectrum was measured (Table 2).The maximum absorption wavelength of compound 8, in which the dimethylamino phenyl group of compound 9 was changed to a julolidine group, was shifted to the long-wavelength side by 30 nm than that of compound 9. Even when the substituent on the boron atom was changed from F to CF3 (compound 11), there was almost no observable change in the maximum absorption wavelength. The maximum absorption wavelength of compound 12, in which R6 was iodine, was shifted to the long-wavelength side by 20 nm. This allowed the compound to be efficiently excited by light with a longer wavelength of over 650 nm. In the cases of the carboxyl group- or sulfonic acid group-substituted tetrahydroquinoline derivatives (compounds 13 to 16) so as to introduce a water-soluble substituent, the absorption wavelength was shifted to the short-wavelength side by about 10 nm than that of the julolidine-substituted derivative. It can be deduced from the above results that as the lone electron pair of the nitrogen atom is arranged more stably on the same plane as that of the benzene ring due to the condensed ring structure of the julolidine or tetrahydroquinoline, the absorption wavelength tends to be shifted more to the long-wavelength side. Also, it was found that introduction of iodine caused a shift to the long-wavelength side and that the substituent on the boron atom did not significantly affect the absorption wavelength.

Test Example 4
(1) To check whether or not the compounds synthesized actually had Aβ oxygenation activity, in vitro oxygenation experiments were carried out using Aβ1-42 as a substrate. Compound 12 (20 µM) was added to a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. Before the light irradiation, native Aβ1-42 and Na+ adducts were primarily observed. After the light irradiation, however, there appeared ion peaks indicating the presence of oxygen adducts in a time-dependent manner (Figure 4).(2) The Aβ1-42 oxygenation activities of compounds 8, 11, and 12 were compared (Figure 5). First, 0.1% TFA aqueous solution containing o-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was diluted with a phosphate buffer solution (PB) (10 mM, pH 7.4) to prepare a native Aβ1-42 solution. To the resulting solution was added a DMSO catalyst stock solution (1.0 M). While incubated at 37°C, the mixture was irradiated with light at 595 nm. The MALDI-TOF MS results demonstrated that compounds 8, 11, and 12 each helped oxygenate Aβ1-42 under the light irradiation. The rate of oxygenation of Aβ1-42 was significantly faster using compound 12 than compounds 8 and 11 free of a heavy atom such as a bromine atom or an iodine atom. The heavy metal effect seems to enhance the efficiency of generating singlet oxygen. In addition, when comparing the compound 8 and 11, the compound 11 having a boron-trifluoromethyl bond had a faster oxygenation rate than the compounds 8, suggesting that the compound 11 can function as a better Aβ oxygenation catalyst.(3) Next, the activities of compounds 12, 14, and 16 were compared (Figure 6). Here, in view of application to multi-component systems such as cells, oxygenation experiments were carried out using DMEM as a solvent. O-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was converted to native Aβ1-42 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), followed by incubation at 37°C for 2 hours to promote aggregation. Then, the resultant was mixed in DMEM. Because the compounds 12, 14, and 16 had a maximum absorption wavelength of more than 650 nm, the reaction was made to proceed by irradiation with light at 660 nm, which was a longer wavelength than that of the preceding experiments. The results demonstrated that the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activity of each of the compounds 14 and 16, in which a water-soluble substituent (i.e., a carboxyl group or a sulfonic acid group) was introduced, was significantly larger than that of the compound 12. The oxygenation activity of the compound 16 having a sulfonic acid site was higher than that of the compound 14 having a carboxylic acid site, indicating the tendency that the higher the water solubility, the higher the oxygenation activity. In addition, Figure 7 shows the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activity of compound 19. (4) To obtain more direct knowledge, compounds 13 to 15 were used to further investigate the functions of an oxygenation photocatalyst having a perfluoroalkyl group on the boron atom. First, the Aβ1-42 oxygenation activities of the compounds 13 to 15 were likewise compared (Figure 8). The results demonstrated that the oxygenation activity was significantly higher in the order of C2F5 > CF3 > F, which were a substituent on the boron atom. This result agrees with the order of the above-described photostability. Accordingly, the level of the catalyst stability is deemed to reflect the activity.
Test Example 5 (Aβ Peptide Selectivity)
Compound 14 was used to investigate whether or not a compound of the present invention was able to selectively oxygenate Aβ. First, compound 14 (20 µM) was added to phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) each containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), angiotensin IV (20 µM) or a methionine enkephalin (20 µM), which solutions had been preincubated for 3 hours. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 30 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. Three model peptides having a residue capable of being oxygenated were selected, including angiotensin IV (AT-4), met-enkephalin (ME), and somatostatin (Sat). These three peptides were subjected to the same oxygenation conditions as for Aβ1-42 (Figure 9). In addition, riboflavin was used as a control which exhibited no Aβ selectivity, and the oxygenation experiments were likewise conducted. The results demonstrated that riboflavin exerted a certain oxygenation activity on all the peptides; by contrast, the compound 14 exerted strong oxygenation activity only toward Aβ1-42; and the oxygenation of each of the other peptides did not proceed at all or was significantly slower than that of Aβ1-42.
Test Example 6 (Oxygenation of Aggregated Aβ peptides)
In the following, in order to check whether or not compound 14 recognized a cross-β-sheet structure characteristic of Aβ aggregates to elicit oxygenation activity, dependency of the oxygenation rate on aggregation was examined. An incubation time after o-acyliso-Aβ1-42 was converted to native Aβ1-42 was used as an index for aggregation process index to check whether or not the oxygenation rate changed depending on the incubation time (Figure 10). A test compound (each 2 µM) was added to a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), which solution had not been incubated, or phosphate buffer solutions (pH 7.4) each containing Aβ1-42 (20 µM), which solutions had been preincubated for 1 or 3 hours. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 10 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 595 nm). Then, a mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to follow the reaction. The results demonstrated that the longer the incubation time, the faster the oxygenation of Aβ1-42. That is, it was found that the richer the cross-β-sheet structure as a result of aggregation, the faster the oxygenation of Aβ1-42. The above has indicated that the compound 14 recognizes the cross-β-sheet structure to selectively oxygenate aggregated Aβ.
Test Example 7 (Test on Cells)
(Method)
Aβ (40 µM) was dissolved in a phosphate buffer solution, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours. Next, compound 16 was added thereto (at 1.6 µM). Then, 0.1% horse serum-containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium was added to rat adrenal pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (purchased from RIKEN, Japan) seeded on a poly D-lysine-coated 96-well plate to prepare a mixture. To the mixture was added 25 µL of the above phosphate buffer solution containing Aβ and compound 16 (the final volume: 100 µL; the final Aβ concentration: 10 µM; the final compound 16 concentration: 0.4 µM). After that, this mixed solution was incubated at 37°C for 5 min under LED light irradiation (at a wavelength of 660 nm; at 10 mW) (provided that in the dark, no light irradiation). The plate containing the cell reaction solution was further incubated at 37°C for 48 hours under 5% CO2 atmosphere. Finally, a viable-cell count reagent SF containing WST-8 (10 µL; purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) was added and the resulting mixture was incubated at 37°C for 3 hours under 5% CO2 atmosphere to measure absorbance at 450 nm (cf., a reference wavelength: 655 nm). From the absorbance, cell viability was determined.
(Results)
Whether or not the oxygenation of Aβ1-42 in the presence of cells caused a decrease in cytotoxicity was investigated. Rat adrenal pheochromocytoma model nerve cells PC12 were used as cells and compound 16 with excellent water solubility and oxygenation activity was used as a catalyst to perform a cell viability (Figure 11). The cell viability was determined by measuring absorbance at 450 nm due to WST-8 using a plate reader. When Aβ1-42 and compound 16 were added under no light irradiation, substantially the same level of significant cell death as in the case where only Aβ1-42 was added was observed. By contrast, the cell viability under light irradiation significantly increased. That is, it has been demonstrated that the selective oxygenation of Aβ1-42 by the catalyst causes a decrease in cytotoxicity.
The present compound represented by formula (1A) has a structure in which an electron donor site and an electron acceptor site rotate around a bond therebetween as a shaft. Even when excited by light in the absence of Aβ, the present compound causes no reaction because of the rotation and resultant relaxation. By contrast, when the compound binds to the higher structure of amyloid and the rotation is inhibited, an oxygenation reaction occurs through the production of singlet oxygen. It is considered that since the activity of the present compound is switchable as describe above, the present compound seems can oxygenate Aβ1-42 in a highly selectable manner even in a complicated system, for example in the presence of cells.
