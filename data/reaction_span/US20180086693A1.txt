FIELD OF INVENTION
The present invention provides compounds suitable as therapeutic agents and intermediates thereto, pharmaceutical compositions of such compounds and methods of treating cancer in cancer patients, and so relates to the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine.
BACKGROUND
Cancer is one of the major causes of human morbidity and mortality. Cancer treatment is challenging because it is difficult to kill cancer cells without damaging or killing normal cells. Damaging or killing normal cells during cancer treatment is a cause of adverse side effects in patients and can limit the amount of anti-cancer drug administered to a cancer patient.
Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the AKR1C3 gene. This gene encodes a member of the aldo/keto reductase superfamily, which consists of more than 40 known enzymes and proteins. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of aldehydes and ketones to their corresponding alcohols by utilizing NADH and/or NADPH as cofactors.
Many cancer cells overexpress AKR1C3 reductase relative to normal cells (See, Cancer Res 2010; 70:1573-1584, Cancer Res 2010; 66: 2815-2825). PR 104:
has been shown to be a weak substrate for AKR1C3 and was tested in the clinical trials as the water soluble phosphate prodrug PR 104P. This compound is not a selective AKR1C3 activated prodrug as it can also be activated under hypoxic conditions. PR104 was ineffective in clinical trials.
There remains a need for compounds suitable for treating cancer patients, including for selective AKR1C3 reductase activated prodrugs for treating cancer patients. The present invention meets this need.

Example 2
In Vitro Human Tumor Cell Line Cytotoxicity Assay
In vitro proliferation data on the H460 non cell lung cancer human tumor cell line is determined based on IC50 measured by exposure of compounds at various concentrations for 2 hrs followed by a wash step and addition of fresh media followed by growth and cell viability staining and comparison to a media only treated control.
Specifically, exponentially growing cells are seeded at a density of 4×103 cells per well in a 96 well plate and incubated at 37° C. in 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity for 24 hours prior to addition of test compounds. Compounds are solubilized in 100% DMSO at 200 times the desired final test concentration. At the time of drug addition, compounds are further diluted to 4 times the desired final concentration with complete medium. Aliquots of 50 μl of compound at specified concentrations are added to microtiter wells already containing 150 μl of medium, resulting in the final drug concentration reported. After drug addition the plates are incubated 72 hrs at 37° C., 5% CO2, 95% air and 100% relative humidity. At the end of this incubation, the viable cells are quantified using the AlamarBlue assay. The drug concentration resulting in growth inhibition of 50% (IC50) is calculated using Prism software (Irvine, Calif.).
Cell proliferation were performed in the presence (3 micromolar) and absence of a specific inhibitor of the AKR 1C3 enzyme. The case of added inhibitor was added to cell culture 2 hours prior to compound treatment. The inhibitor used was compound 36 in Flanagan, et al, Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry (2014) p 962-977.
