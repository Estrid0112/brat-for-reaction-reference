BACKGROUND
The present disclosure provides compounds and pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of those compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, that are effective in inhibiting the binding or function of various chemokines to chemokine receptors. As antagonists or modulators of chemokine receptors, the compounds and compositions have utility in treating various immune disorder conditions and diseases.
Chemokines, also known as chemotactic cytokines, are a group of small molecular-weight proteins that are released by a wide variety of cells and have a variety of biological activities. Chemokines attract various types of cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils, and cause them to migrate from the blood to various lymphoid and none-lymphoid tissues. They mediate infiltration of inflammatory cells to sites of inflammation, and are responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of many inflammation diseases (reviewed in Schall, Cytokine, 3:165-183 (1991), Schall et al., Curr. Opin. Immunol., 6:865-873 (1994)).
In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, chemokines can induce other changes in responsive cells, including changes in cell shape, granule exocytosis, integrin up-regulation, formation of bioactive lipids (e.g., leukotrienes), respiratory burst associated with leukocyte activation, cell proliferation, resistance to induction of apoptosis and angiogenesis. Thus, chemokines are early triggers of the inflammatory response, causing inflammatory mediator release, chemotaxis and extravasation to sites of infection or inflammation. They are also stimulators of a multitude of cellular processes that bear important physiological functions as well as pathological consequences.
Chemokines exert their effects by activating chemokine receptors expressed by responsive cells. Chemokine receptors are a class of G-protein coupled receptors, also known as seven-transmembrane receptors, found on the surface of a wide variety of cell types such as leukocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and tumor cells.
Chemokines and chemokine receptors are expressed by intrinsic renal cells and infiltrating cells during renal inflammation (Segerer et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 11:152-76 (2000); Morii et al., J. Diabetes Complications, 17:11-5 (2003); Lloyd et al. J. Exp. Med., 185:1371-80 (1997); Gonzalez-Cuadrado et al. Clin. Exp. Immunol., 106:518-22 (1996); Eddy & Giachelli, Kidney Int., 47:1546-57 (1995); Diamond et al., Am. J. Physiol., 266:F926-33 (1994)).
T-lymphocyte (T cell) infiltration into the small intestine and colon has been linked to the pathogenesis of Coeliac diseases, food allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking trafficking of relevant T cell populations to the intestine can lead to an effective approach to treat human IBD. More recently, chemokine receptor-9 (CCR(9)) has been noted to be expressed on gut-homing T cells in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease. The only CCR(9) ligand identified to date, TECK (thymus-expressed chemokine) is expressed in both the small and large intestines and the ligand receptor pair is now thought to play a pivotal role in the development of IBD. In particular, this pair mediates the migration of disease causing inflammatory cells to the intestine. See for example, Zaballos et al., J. Immunol., 162(10):5671-5675 (1999); Kunkel et al., J. Exp. Med., 192(5):761-768 (2000); Papadakis et al., J. Immunol., 165(9):5069-5076 (2000); Papadakis et al., Gastroenterology, 121(2):246-254 (2001); Campbell et al., J. Exp. Med., 195(1):135-141 (2002); Wurbel et al., Blood, 98(9):2626-2632 (2001); and Uehara et al., J. Immunol, 168(6):2811-2819 (2002); Rivera-Nieves et al., Gastroenterology, 2006 November; 131(5):1518-29; and Kontoyiannis et al., J. Exp. Med., Vol. 196, Number 12, Dec. 16, 2002. In addition CCR(9) bearing lymphocytes have been show to mediate the pathology of filariasis (lymphatic filarial disease) and inhibition of CCR(9) has been correlated with reduction of the pathology associated with such conditions. See for example Babu et al., Journal of Infectious Diseases, 191: 1018-26, 2005.
Furthermore, CCR9+ T-helper cells have been found to increase in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, a systemic chronic inflammatory disorder whereby the exocrine glands are infiltrated by lymphocytes. Patients with Sjogren's syndrome develop xerostomia (dry eyes) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) when the inflammatory process impacts the salivary and lacrimal glands. McGuire et al., Immunity, 34(4):602-615 (2011).
Thus the identification of compounds that modulate the function of CCR(9) represents an attractive new family of therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammatory and other conditions and diseases associated with CCR(9) activation, such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Certain specific compounds of the present disclosure contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
The neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but otherwise the salts are equivalent to the parent form of the compound for the purposes of the present disclosure.
“Salt thereof” refers to a compound formed when the hydrogen of an acid is replaced by a cation, such as a metal cation or an organic cation and the like. Preferably, the salt is a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt, although this is not required for salts of intermediate compounds which are not intended for administration to a patient.
In addition to salt forms, the present disclosure provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present disclosure which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound of the disclosure.
Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are those compounds that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present disclosure. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the present disclosure by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to the compounds of the present disclosure when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent.
Prodrugs may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compounds. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds of the disclosure. Preparation, selection, and use of prodrugs is discussed in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; “Design of Prodrugs”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985; and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
The compounds of the disclosure may be present in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable metabolites thereof. The term “metabolite” means a pharmaceutically acceptable form of a metabolic derivative of a compound of the disclosure (or a salt thereof). In some aspects, the metabolite may be a functional derivative of a compound that is readily convertible in vivo into an active compound. In other aspects, the metabolite may be an active compound.
The term “acid isosteres” means, unless otherwise stated, a group which can replace a carboxylic acid, having an acidic functionality and steric and electronic characteristics that provide a level of activity (or other compound characteristic such as solubility) similar to a carboxylic acid. Representative acid isosteres include: hydroxamic acids, sulfonic acids, sulfinic acids, sulfonamides, acyl-sulfonamides, phosphonic acids, phosphinic acids, phosphoric acids, tetrazole, and oxo-oxadiazoles.
“Therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need of treatment.
“Treating” or “treatment” as used herein refers to the treating or treatment of a disease or medical condition (such as a viral, bacterial or fungal infection or other infectious diseases, as well as autoimmune or inflammatory conditions) in a patient, such as a mammal (particularly a human or a companion animal) which includes ameliorating the disease or medical condition, i.e., eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient; suppressing the disease or medical condition, i.e., slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a patient; or alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical condition in a patient.
Certain compounds of the present disclosure can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, both solvated forms and unsolvated forms are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. Certain compounds of the present disclosure may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms (i.e., as polymorphs). In general, all physical forms are equivalent for the uses contemplated by the present disclosure and are intended to be within the scope of the present disclosure.
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of the present disclosure may exist in tautomeric forms; all such tautomeric forms of the compounds being within the scope of the disclosure. For example, some compounds having heteroaryl may be substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups. Tautomeric forms would, therefore, include oxo substitutions. Certain compounds of the present disclosure possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers (e.g., separate enantiomers) are all intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure.
The compounds of the present disclosure may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present disclosure, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present disclosure. For example, the compounds may be prepared such that any number of hydrogen atoms are replaced with a deuterium (2H) isotope. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. Unnatural proportions of an isotope may be defined as ranging from the amount found in nature to an amount consisting of 100% of the atom in question. For example, the compounds may incorporate radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C), or non-radioactive isotopes, such as deuterium (2H) or carbon-13 (13C). Such isotopic variations can provide additional utilities to those described elsewhere within this application. For instance, isotopic variants of the compounds of the invention may find additional utility, including but not limited to, as diagnostic and/or imaging reagents, or as cytotoxic/radiotoxic therapeutic agents. Additionally, isotopic variants of the compounds of the invention can have altered pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics which can contribute to enhanced safety, tolerability or efficacy during treatment. All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The compounds of the present disclosure may include a detectable label. A detectable label is a group that is detectable at low concentrations, usually less than micromolar, probably less than nanomolar and possibly less than picomolar, and that can be readily distinguished from other molecules, due to differences in a molecular property (e.g. molecular weight, mass to charge ratio, radioactivity, redox potential, luminescence, fluorescence, electromagnetic properties, binding properties, and the like). Detectable labels may be detected by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, optical or chemical means and the like.
A wide variety of detectable labels are within the scope of the present disclosure, including hapten labels (e.g. biotin, or labels used in conjunction with detectable antibodies such as horse radish peroxidase antibodies); mass tag labels (e.g. stable isotope labels); radioisotopic labels (including 3H, 125I, 35S, 14C, or 32P); metal chelate labels; luminescent labels including fluorescent labels (such as fluorescein, isothiocyanate, Texas red, rhodamine, green fluorescent protein, and the like), phosphorescent labels, and chemiluminescent labels, typically having quantum yield greater than 0.1; electroactive and electron transfer labels; enzyme modulator labels including coenzymes, organometallic catalysts horse radish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase and others commonly used in an ELISA; photosensitizer labels; magnetic bead labels including Dynabeads; colorimetric labels such as colloidal gold, silver, selenium, or other metals and metal sol labels (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,643, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes), or colored glass or plastic (e.g., polystyrene, polypropylene, latex, etc.) bead labels; and carbon black labels. Patents teaching the use of such detectable labels include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,817,837; 3,850,752; 3,939,350; 3,996,345; 4,277,437; 4,275,149; 4,366,241; 6,312,914; 5,990,479; 6,207,392; 6,423,551; 6,251,303; 6,306,610; 6,322,901; 6,319,426; 6,326,144; and 6,444,143, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.
Detectable labels are commercially available or may be prepared as known to one skilled in the art. Detectable labels may be covalently attached to the compounds using a reactive functional group, which can be located at any appropriate position. Methods for attaching a detectable label are known to one skilled in the art. When the reactive group is attached to an alkyl, or substituted alkyl chain tethered to an aryl nucleus, the reactive group may be located at a terminal position of an alkyl chain.
Compounds
The present disclosure provides compounds that modulate the activity of CCR(9). Chemokine receptors are integral membrane proteins which interact with an extracellular ligand, such as a chemokine, and mediate a cellular response to the ligand, e.g., chemotaxis, increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, etc. Therefore, modulation of a chemokine receptor function, e.g., interference with a chemokine receptor ligand interaction, will modulate a chemokine receptor mediated response, and treat or prevent a chemokine receptor mediated condition or disease. Modulation of a chemokine receptor function includes both inducement and inhibition of the function. The type of modulation accomplished will depend on the characteristics of the compound, i.e., antagonist or full, partial or inverse agonist.
For example, compounds of this disclosure act as potent CCR(9) antagonists, and this antagonistic activity has been further confirmed in animal testing for inflammation, one of the hallmark disease states for CCR(9). Accordingly, the compounds provided herein are useful in pharmaceutical compositions, methods for the treatment of CCR(9)-mediated diseases, and as controls in assays for the identification of competitive CCR(9) antagonists.
In the formulae set forth below, when a variable appears more than once in the same formula, it can be either the same or different. For example, in formula (I), one R8 can be -NH2 and the remainder can be hydrogen.

Compositions that Modulate Chemokine Activity
In another aspect, the present disclosure provides compositions that modulate chemokine activity, specifically CCR(9) activity. Generally, the compositions for modulating chemokine receptor activity in humans and animals will comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or diluent and a compound having any of the formulae I-III.
The term “composition” as used herein is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts. By “pharmaceutically acceptable” it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this disclosure may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active object compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases.
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions and self-emulsifications as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,451,339, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with other non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents such as cellulose, silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example PVP, cellulose, PEG, starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated enterically or otherwise by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release.
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil. Additionally, emulsions can be prepared with a non-water miscible ingredient such as oils and stabilized with surfactants such as mono-diglycerides, PEG esters and the like.
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure may also be in the form of oil in water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth, naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative, and flavoring and coloring agents. Oral solutions can be prepared in combination with, for example, cyclodextrin, PEG and surfactants.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, axed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
The compounds of the present disclosure may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials are cocoa butter and polyethylene glycols. Additionally, the compounds can be administered via ocular delivery by means of solutions or ointments. Still further, transdermal delivery of the subject compounds can be accomplished by means of iontophoretic patches and the like.
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions containing the compounds of the present disclosure are employed. As used herein, topical application is also meant to include the use of mouth washes and gargles.
The pharmaceutical compositions and methods of the present disclosure may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein, such as those applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.
In one embodiment, the present disclosure provides a composition consisting of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of the disclosure.
Methods of Treatment
Depending on the disease to be treated and the subject's condition, the compounds and compositions of the present disclosure may be administered by oral, parenteral (e.g., intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, ICV, intracisternal injection or infusion, subcutaneous injection, or implant), inhalation, nasal, vaginal, rectal, sublingual, or topical routes of administration and may be formulated, alone or together, in suitable dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles appropriate for each route of administration. The present disclosure also contemplates administration of the compounds and compositions of the present disclosure in a depot formulation.
In the treatment or prevention of conditions which require chemokine receptor modulation an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.001 to 100 mg per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. Preferably, the dosage level will be about 0.01 to about 25 mg/kg per day; more preferably about 0.05 to about 10 mg/kg per day. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 25 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 10 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 5 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.005 to 0.05, 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5.0, or 5.0 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0, 100.0, 150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of 1 to 4 times per day, preferably once or twice per day.
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, hereditary characteristics, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.
In some embodiments, compounds of the present disclosure are administered as part of a combination therapy. For instance an amount of a chemotherapeutic agent or radiation is administered to the subject prior to, subsequent to or in combination with the compounds of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the amount is sub-therapeutic when the chemotherapeutic agent or radiation is administered alone. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that “combinations” can involve combinations in treatments (i.e., two or more drugs can be administered as a mixture, or at least concurrently or at least introduced into a subject at different times but such that both are in the bloodstream of a subject at the same time). Additionally, compositions of the current disclosure may be administered prior to or subsequent to a second therapeutic regimen, for instance prior to or subsequent to a dose of chemotherapy or irradiation.
In still other embodiments, the present methods are directed to the treatment of allergic diseases, wherein a compound or composition of the disclosure is administered either alone or in combination with a second therapeutic agent, wherein said second therapeutic agent is an antihistamine or an anti-inflammatory. When used in combination, the practitioner can administer a combination of the compound or composition of the present disclosure and a second therapeutic agent. Also, the compound or composition and the second therapeutic agent can be administered sequentially, in any order.
The compounds and compositions of the present disclosure can be combined with other compounds and compositions having related utilities to prevent and treat the condition or disease of interest, such as inflammatory conditions and diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), allergic diseases, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and asthma, Sjögren's syndrome and those pathologies noted above. Selection of the appropriate agents for use in combination therapies can be made one of ordinary skill in the art. The combination of therapeutic agents may act synergistically to effect the treatment or prevention of the various disorders. Using this approach, one may be able to achieve therapeutic efficacy with lower dosages of each agent, thus reducing the potential for adverse side effects.
In treating, preventing, ameliorating, controlling or reducing the risk of inflammation, the compounds of the present disclosure may be used in conjunction with an antiinflammatory or analgesic agent such as an opiate agonist, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, such as an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, such as a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, an interleukin inhibitor, such as an interleukin-1 inhibitor, an NMDA antagonist, an inhibitor of nitric oxide or an inhibitor of the synthesis of nitric oxide, aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs, a non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent, or a cytokine-suppressing antiinflammatory agent, for example with a compound such as acetaminophen, aspirin, codeine, biological TNF sequestrants, biological agents which target α4β7, ACE2 inhibitors, protein linase C inhibitors, fentanyl, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketorolac, morphine, naproxen, phenacetin, piroxicam, a steroidal analgesic, sufentanyl, sunlindac, tenidap, and the like.
Similarly, the compounds of the present disclosure may be administered with a pain reliever; a potentiator such as caffeine, an H2-antagonist, simethicone, aluminum or magnesium hydroxide; a decongestant such as pseudophedrine; an antitussive such as codeine; a diuretic; a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine; a very late antigen (VLA-4) antagonist; an immunosuppressant such as cyclosporin, tacrolimus, rapamycin, EDG receptor agonists, or other FK-506 type immunosuppressants; a steroid; a non-steroidal anti-asthmatic agent such as a β2-agonist, leukotriene antagonist, or leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitor; an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type IV (PDE-IV); a cholesterol lowering agent such as a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, sequestrant, or cholesterol absorption inhibitor; and an anti-diabetic agent such as insulin, α-glucosidase inhibitors or glitazones.
The weight ratio of the compound of the present disclosure to the second active ingredient may be varied and will depend upon the effective dose of each ingredient. Generally, an effective dose of each will be used. Thus, for example, when a compound of the present disclosure is combined with an NSAID the weight ratio of the compound of the present disclosure to the NSAID will generally range from about 1000:1 to about 1:1000, preferably about 200:1 to about 1:200. Combinations of a compound of the present disclosure and other active ingredients will generally also be within the aforementioned range, but in each case, an effective dose of each active ingredient should be used.
Methods of Treating or Preventing CCR(9)-Mediated Conditions or Diseases
In yet another aspect, the present disclosure provides methods of treating or preventing a CCR(9)-mediated condition or disease by administering to a subject having such a condition or disease a therapeutically effective amount of any compound of formulae above. Compounds for use in the present methods include those compounds according to the above formulae, those provided above as embodiments, those specifically exemplified in the Examples below, and those provided with specific structures herein. The “subject” is defined herein to include animals such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice and the like. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.
As used herein, the phrase “CCR(9)-mediated condition or disease” and related phrases and terms refer to a condition or disease characterized by inappropriate, i.e., less than or greater than normal, CCR(9) functional activity. Inappropriate CCR(9) functional activity might arise as the result of CCR(9) expression in cells which normally do not express CCR(9), increased CCR(9) expression (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases) or decreased CCR(9) expression. Inappropriate CCR(9) functional activity might also arise as the result of TECK secretion by cells which normally do not secrete TECK, increased TECK expression (leading to, e.g., inflammatory and immunoregulatory disorders and diseases) or decreased TECK expression. A CCR(9)-mediated condition or disease may be completely or partially mediated by inappropriate CCR(9) functional activity. However, a CCR(9)-mediated condition or disease is one in which modulation of CCR(9) results in some effect on the underlying condition or disease (e.g., a CCR(9) antagonist results in some improvement in patient well-being in at least some patients).
The term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the subject compound that will elicit the biological or medical response of a cell, tissue, system, or animal, such as a human, that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other treatment provider.
Diseases and conditions associated with inflammation, immune disorders, infection and cancer can be treated or prevented with the present compounds, compositions, and methods. In one group of embodiments, diseases or conditions, including chronic diseases, of humans or other species can be treated with inhibitors of CCR(9) function. These diseases or conditions include: (1) allergic diseases such as systemic anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity responses, drug allergies, insect sting allergies and food allergies, (2) inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, microscopic colitis, ileitis and enteritis, and postoperative ileus, (3) vaginitis, (4) psoriasis and inflammatory dermatoses such as dermatitis, eczema, atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, urticaria and pruritus, (5) vasculitis, (6) spondyloarthropathies, (7) scleroderma, (8) asthma and respiratory allergic diseases such as allergic asthma, allergic rhinitis, hypersensitivity lung diseases and the like, (9) autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome, fibromyalagia, ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile RA, Still's disease, polyarticular juvenile RA, pauciarticular juvenile RA, polymyalgia rheumatica, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, polyarticular arthritis, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, type I diabetes, type II diabetes, glomerulonephritis, and the like, (10) graft rejection (including allograft rejection), (11) graft-v-host disease (including both acute and chronic), (12) other diseases in which undesired inflammatory responses are to be inhibited, such as atherosclerosis, myositis, neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), encephalitis, meningitis, hepatitis, nephritis, sepsis, sarcoidosis, allergic conjunctivitis, otitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis, Behcet's syndrome and gout, (13) immune mediated food allergies such as Coeliac (Celiac) disease (14) pulmonary fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases, (15) irritable bowel syndrome, (16) primary sclerosing cholangitis, (17) cancer (including both primary and metastatic), (18) bacterial associated syndromes such as hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (19) melanoma, (20) primary sclerosing cholangitis, (21) post-operative ileus, (22) hepatitis, and (23) inflammatory hepatic diseases.
In another group of embodiments, diseases or conditions can be treated with modulators and agonists of CCR(9) function. Examples of diseases to be treated by modulating CCR(9) function include cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diseases in which angiogenesis or neovascularization play a role (neoplastic diseases, retinopathy and macular degeneration), infectious diseases (viral infections, e.g., HIV infection, and bacterial infections) and immunosuppressive diseases such as organ transplant conditions and skin transplant conditions. The term “organ transplant conditions” is means to include bone marrow transplant conditions and solid organ (e.g., kidney, liver, lung, heart, pancreas or combination thereof) transplant conditions.
Preferably, the present methods are directed to the treatment of diseases or conditions selected from inflammatory bowel disease including Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis, allergic diseases, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and asthma, autoimmune disease such as Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and immune-mediated food allergies such as Coelaic disease.
In yet other embodiments, the present methods are directed to the treatment of psoriasis where a compound or composition of the disclosure is used alone or in combination with a second therapeutic agent such as a corticosteroid, a lubricant, a keratolytic agent, a vitamin D3 derivative, PUVA and anthralin.
In other embodiments, the present methods are directed to the treatment of atopic dermatitis using a compound or composition of the disclosure either alone or in combination with a second therapeutic agent such as a lubricant and a corticosteroid.
In further embodiments, the present methods are directed to the treatment of asthma using a compound or composition of the disclosure either alone or in combination with a second therapeutic agent such as a β2-agonist and a corticosteroid.

Reagents and solvents used below can be obtained from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemical Co. (Milwaukee, Wis., USA). 1H-NMR were recorded on a Varian Mercury 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Significant peaks are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (br, broad; s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet) and number of protons. Mass spectrometry results are reported as the ratio of mass over charge, followed by the relative abundance of each ion (in parenthesis). In tables, a single m/e value is reported for the M+H (or, as noted, M−H, M+Na, etc.) ion containing the most common atomic isotopes. Isotope patterns correspond to the expected formula in all cases. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry analysis was conducted on a Hewlett-Packard MSD electrospray mass spectrometer using the HP1100 HPLC for sample delivery. Normally the analyte was dissolved in methanol at 0.1 mg/mL and 1 microliter was infused with the delivery solvent into the mass spectrometer, which scanned from 100 to 1500 daltons. All compounds could be analyzed in the positive ESI mode, using acetonitrile/water with 1% formic acid as the delivery solvent. The compounds provided below could also be analyzed in the negative ESI mode, using 2 mM NH4OAc in acetonitrile/water as delivery system.
Compounds of the present disclosure may be synthesized by General Synthesis A shown below. Treatment of an aryl sulfonyl chloride of formula A with the pyrazole amine B in the presence of a base such as pyridine at a suitable temperature, for example 80° C., affords the aryl sulfonamides of formula C. The pyrazole amines, B, may be synthesized treatment of hydrazine D with nitrile C at a suitable elevated temperature in a solvent such as ethanol. One skilled in the art will understand that the substituents, including, for example, R1, R2, R3, R4, and R6 may need to be protected as known to one skilled in the art with standard protecting groups during the synthesis depending upon their reactivity to the reaction conditions.

The reaction mixture was then poured into ice and aqueous sodium bicarbonate was added. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude residue was used without further purification (0.20 g, 0.59 mmol, 100%).

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and the organic volatile was removed in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in 2:1 chloromethane/iPrOH and washed with aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide and aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate.

Measuring Efficacy of Chemokine Modulators
In Vitro Assays
A variety of assays can be used to evaluate the compounds provided herein, including signaling assays, chemotaxis (migration assays), ligand binding assays, and other assays of cellular response. Chemokine receptor signaling assays can be used to measure the ability of a compound, such as a potential CCR(9) antagonist, to block CCR(9) ligand-(e.g. TECK)-induced signaling. Blocking such signaling can be useful in treating various diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases, an allergic disease, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, asthma, fibrotic diseases, graft rejection, immune mediated food allergies, autoimmune diseases, Celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, thymoma, thymic carcinoma, leukemia, solid tumor, acute lymphocytic leukemia, melanoma, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis, inflammatory hepatic disease, or post-operative ileus. A chemotaxis assay can be used to measure the ability of a compound of interest, such as a possible chemokine antagonist, to block chemokine-mediated cell migration in vitro. The latter is believed to resemble chemokine-induced cell migration in vivo. A ligand binding assay can also be used to measure the ability of a compound, such as a potential CCR(9) antagonist, to block the interaction of TECK or other CCR(9) ligands with their receptor.
In a suitable assay, a chemokine protein (whether isolated or recombinant) or other ligand is used that has at least one property, activity, or functional characteristic of a mammalian chemokine protein. The property can be a binding property (to, for example, a ligand or inhibitor), a signaling activity (e.g., activation of a mammalian G protein, induction of rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium ion), cellular response function (e.g., stimulation of chemotaxis or inflammatory mediator release by leukocytes), and the like.
The assay can be a cell-based assay that utilizes cells stably or transiently transfected with a vector or expression cassette having a nucleic acid sequence that encodes the chemokine receptor. Cell lines or isolated primary cells naturally expressing the chemokine can also be used. The cells are maintained under conditions appropriate for expression of the receptor and are contacted with a putative agent under conditions appropriate for binding to occur. Binding can be detected using standard techniques. For example, the extent of binding can be determined relative to a suitable control (for example, relative to background in the absence of a putative agent, or relative to a known ligand). Optionally, a cellular fraction, such as a membrane fraction, containing the receptor can be used in lieu of whole cells.
Detection of binding or complex formation can be detected directly or indirectly. For example, the putative agent can be labeled with a suitable label (e.g., fluorescent label, chemiluminescent label, isotope label, enzyme label, and the like) and binding can be determined by detection of the label. Specific and/or competitive binding can be assessed by competition or displacement studies, using unlabeled agent or a ligand (e.g., TECK) as a competitor.
Binding inhibition assays can be used to evaluate the present compounds. In these assays, the compounds are evaluated as inhibitors of ligand binding using, for example, TECK or small molecule ligands. The CCR(9) receptor is contacted with a ligand in the presence or absence of a test agent, and a measure of ligand binding is made. A reduction in the extent of ligand binding is indicative of inhibition of binding by the test agent. The binding inhibition assays can be carried out using whole cells which express the receptor, or a membrane fraction from cells which express the receptor.
Further, the binding of a G protein coupled receptor by, for example, an agonist, can result in a signaling event by the receptor. Accordingly, signaling assays can also be used to evaluate the compounds of the present disclosure and induction of signaling function by an agent can be monitored using any suitable method. For example, G protein activity, such as hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, or later signaling events triggered by receptor binding can be assayed by known methods (see, for example, PCT/US97/15915; Neote et al., Cell, 72:415425 (1993); Van Riper et al., J. Exp. Med., 177:851-856 (1993) and Dahinden et al., J. Exp. Med., 179:751-756 (1994)). Calcium signaling assays also measure GPCR activity, by measuring intra-cellular calcium concentration over time, preferably before and after receptor/ligand binding in the presence or absence of a test agent. These assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present disclosure, to generate the receptor signaling mediator by binding to a receptor of interest. Also, these assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present disclosure, to inhibit generation of the receptor signaling mediator by interfering with binding between a receptor of interest and a ligand.
In calcium signaling assays used to determine the ability of a compound to interfere with binding between a chemokine receptor and a known chemokine ligand, chemokine receptor-expressing cells (CCR(9)-expressing cells such as T cell line MOLT-4 cells) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a potential chemokine antagonist, at increasing concentrations. The cell number can be from 105 to 5×106 cells per well in a 96-well microtiter plate. The concentration of the compound being tested may range from 0 to 100 μM. After a period of incubation (which can range from 5 to 60 minutes), the treated cells are placed in a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR®) (available from Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The FLIPR® system is well known to those skilled in the art as a standard method of performing assays. The cells are then stimulated with an appropriate amount of the chemokine ligand (TECK for CCR(9)) at 5-100 nM final concentration, and the signal of intracellular calcium increase (also called calcium flux) is recorded. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of binding between the chemokine and the ligand can be calculated as an IC50 (the concentration needed to cause 50% inhibition in signaling) or IC90 (at 90% inhibition).
Chemotaxis assays can also be used to assess receptor function and evaluate the compounds provided herein. These assays are based on the functional migration of cells in vitro or in vivo induced by an agent, and can be used to assess the binding and/or effect on chemotaxis of ligands, inhibitors, or agonists. A variety of chemotaxis assays are known in the art, and any suitable assay can be used to evaluate the compounds of the present disclosure. Examples of suitable assays include those described in PCT/US97/15915; Springer et al., WO 94/20142; Berman et al., Immunol. Invest., 17:625-677 (1988); and Kavanaugh et al., J. Immunol., 146:4149-4156 (1991)).
In vitro cell chemotaxis assays can be performed (but are not limited to this format) using the 96-well microchamber (called ChemoTX™). The ChemoTX™ system is well known to those skilled in the art as a type of chemotactic/cell migration instrument. In this assay, CCR(9)-expressing cells (such as MOLT-4) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a possible CCR(9) antagonist at increasing concentrations. Typically, fifty thousand cells per well are used, but the amount can range from 103-106 cells per well. The chemokine ligand (for example, CCR(9) ligand TECK, typically at 50 nM (but can range from 5-100 nM)), is placed at the lower chamber and the migration apparatus is assembled. Twenty microliters of test compound-treated cells are then placed onto the membrane. Migration is allowed to take place at 37° C. for a period of time, typically 2.5 hours for CCR(9). At the end of the incubation, the number of cells that migrated across the membrane into the lower chamber is then quantified. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of chemokine-mediated cell migration can be calculated as an IC50 (the concentration needed to reduce cell migration by 50%) or IC90 (for 90% inhibition).
In Vivo Efficacy Models for Human IBD
T cell infiltration into the small intestine and colon have been linked to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases which include Coeliac disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking trafficking of relevant T cell populations to the intestine is believed to be an effective approach to treat human IBD. CCR(9) is expressed on gut-homing T cells in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease and Coeliac disease. CCR(9) ligand TECK is expressed in the small intestine. It is thus believed that this ligand-receptor pair plays a role in IBD development by mediating migration of T cells to the intestine. Several animal models exist and can be used for evaluating compounds of interest, such as potential CCR(9) antagonists, for an ability to affect such T cell migration and/or condition or disease, which might allow efficacy predictions of antagonists in humans.
Animal Models with Pathology Similar to Human Ulcerative Colitis
A murine model described by Panwala and coworkers (Panwala et al., J Immunol., 161(10):5733-44 (1998)) involves genetic deletion of the murine multi-drug resistant gene (MDR). MDR knockout mice (MDR−/−) are susceptible to developing a severe, spontaneous intestinal inflammation when maintained under specific pathogen-free facility conditions. The intestinal inflammation seen in MDR−/− mice has a pathology similar to that of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is defined by Th1 type T cells infiltration into the lamina propria of the large intestine.
Another murine model was described by Davidson et al., J Exp Med., 184(1):241-51 (1986). In this model, the murine IL-10 gene was deleted and mice rendered deficient in the production of interleukin 10 (IL-10−/−). These mice develop a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that predominates in the colon and shares histopathological features with human IBD.
Another murine model for IBD has been described by Powrie et al., Int. Immunol., 5(11):1461-71 (1993), in which a subset of CD4+ T cells (called CD45RB(high)) from immunocompetent mice are purified and adoptively transferred into immunodeficient mice (such as C.B-17 scid mice). The animal restored with the CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell population developed a lethal wasting disease with severe mononuclear cell infiltrates in the colon, pathologically similar with human IBD.
The TNF ARE(−/−) model. The role of TNF in Crohn's disease in human has been demonstrated more recently by success of treatment using anti-TNF alpha antibody by Targan et al., N. Engl. J Med., 337(15):1029-35 (1997). Mice with aberrant production of TNF-alpha due to genetic alteration in the TNF gene
(ARE−/−) develop Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel diseases (see Kontoyiannis et al., Immunity, 10(3):387-98 (1999)).
The SAMP/yit model. This model is described by Kosiewicz et al., J Clin. Invest., 107(6):695-702 (2001). The mouse strain, SAMP/Yit, spontaneously develops a chronic inflammation localized to the terminal ileum. The resulting ileitis is characterized by massive infiltration of activated T lymphocytes into the lamina propria, and bears a remarkable resemblance to human Crohn's disease.
Examples of In Vitro Assays
Reagents
MOLT-4 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va.) and cultured in RPMI tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. Recombinant human chemokine proteins TECK was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). ChemoTX® chemotaxis microchambers were purchased from Neuro Probe (Gaithersburg, Md.). CyQUANT® cell proliferation kits were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). Calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 AM was purchased from Molecular Devices (Mountain View, Calif.).
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Calcium Mobilization Assay
A cytoplasmic calcium mobilization assay was used to determine the efficacy of potential receptor antagonists at blocking the signals mediated through chemokine receptors, such as CCR(9). This assay was routinely performed using the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices). MOLT-4 cells were labeled with the fluorescent-indicator dye Fluo-4 (Molecular Devices) according to the manufacturer's directions. After labeling, the cells were collected by centrifugation (400×g for 5 min at room temperature) and resuspended in HBSS to a cell density of 2.5×106 cells/mL. Test compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO at 100× the final concentration; generally, a range of concentrations of each compound were tested, with final concentrations from 0.1 nM to 10,000 nM. Labeled cells (300 μL) were mixed with compound or an equal volume of DMSO (3 μL) in a 96-well plate; after thorough mixing, 50 μL of this cell/compound mixture was added to each of four wells of a 384-well FLIPR plate. The chemokine agonist (i.e., hTECK), prepared in HBSS at a 5× concentration of the previously determined EC50 concentration, was added to each well and resulting changes in the fluorescent intensity, indicative of chemokine receptor-mediated signaling, were recorded on the FLIPR. The compound IC50 values were calculated with these data using Graphpad Prism software (Graphpad Software) and a nonlinear regression, one-site competition model.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Serum Chemotaxis Assay
A serum chemotaxis assay was used to determine the efficacy of potential receptor antagonists at blocking the migration mediated through chemokine receptors, such as CCR(9). This assay was performed using the ChemoTX® microchamber system with a 5-μm pore-sized polycarbonate membrane. MOLT-4 cells were collected by centrifugation at 400×g at room temperature, then suspended at 50 million/ml in human serum, containing 50 mM HEPES (final pH of 7.2). The compound being tested or an equivalent volume of its solvent (DMSO) was then added to the cell/serum mixture at a final DMSO concentration of 0.125% (v/v), and this mixture was then incubated together at 37° C. for one hour. Separately, recombinant human TECK was diluted with chemotaxis buffer (HBSS+0.1% BSA), generally spanning a range from 0.1 nM to 500 nM, after which 29 μl of diluted chemokine was placed in the lower wells of the ChemoTX® plate. The 5-μm (pore size) polycarbonate membrane was placed onto the plate, and 20 μL of the cell/compound mixture was transferred onto each well of the membrane. The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 90 minutes, after which the polycarbonate membranes were removed and 5 μl of the DNA-intercalating agent CyQUANT (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) was added to the lower wells. The amount of fluorescence, corresponding to the number of migrated cells, was measured using a Spectrafluor Plus plate reader (TECAN, San Jose, Calif.).
The A2 values were calculated from the following equation, comparing the efficacy of the test compound with that of the DMSO-only control at equi-active chemokine levels:
<in-line-formulae>Log(A2)=log [drug(M)]−log [(A'/A)−1]</in-line-formulae>
where A reflects the potency of the agonist in the absence of antagonist and A reflects the potency of the agonist in the presence of antagonist at a given concentration of drug ([drug(M)]).
Examples of In Vivo Efficacy Assays
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a CCR(9) Dependent T Cell Trafficking Model
Single cell suspensions were prepared from spleens and lymph nodes of OT-I Tg CD45.1 mice. 15×106 total cells (about 3×106 CD8 T cells) were injected into sex-matched congenic CD45.2 C57BL/6n mice (8-10 weeks old). 24 hours later, animals were immunized via oral gavage with 25 mg Ovalbumin protein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.)+10 ug Cholera Toxin (Calbiochem, San Diego, Calif.). CCR(9) antagonists were administered prior to oral ovalbumin in a time frame dictated by their mouse pharmacokinetics and dosed throughout. Five days post immunization, animals were euthanized, and small intestines were harvested. Peyer's patches were removed and, after flushing with PBS, the gut was opened on a wet square of Optima fabric (Allegiance Healthcare). The mucosa was scraped with a scalpel and then dissociated by stirring in 50 ml of medium containing 10% newborn calf serum and DTT (1 mM) for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in PBS containing 10% newborn calf serum, vortexed for 3 min, and rapidly passed through a glass wool column (1.6 g packed in a 20-ml syringe; Fisher Scientific). IEL were further purified on a Ficoll-Paque gradient and stained with mAbs for flow cytometry analysis. Transferred OT-1 Tg CD45.1 T cells were detected and quantified by flow cytometry. In this model treatment with a compound of the disclosure resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of OT-1 Tg CD45.1 T cells that traffic to the small intestine in response to antigen.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Cell Transfer Model of Colitis
Single cell suspensions of purified CD4+ CD25− T cells were generated from the spleen and lymph nodes of Balb/c mice. 1×106 CD4+ CD25− T cell were then transferred into sex and age-matched CB17 SCID mice. CD4+ CD25− recipient mice received either vehicle or a compound of the disclosure starting 2 hrs prior to the transfer. Mice body weights were monitored weekly, as mice develop disease they lose weight. Mice in which the disease progression has been slowed or inhibited will have a marked difference in their body weight relative to mice receiving vehicle. At the end of the study the colons of the mice are weighed and measured in order to assess the remodeling of the target tissue. Changes in cytokines were also measured in colonic tissue homogenates. Treatment with a compound of the disclosure results in significant protection from the wasting associated with disease as well as a normalization of the colonic remodeling and proinflammatory cytokine levels.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Model of Inhibition of HIV Spread
In the bone marrow/liver/thymus, or “BLT” mouse, nonobese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice (which lack endogenous T and B cells) are surgically implanted with fetal thymic and liver organoids, as in the SCID-hu system. The mice are then sublethally irradiated and transplanted with autologous CD34+ stem cells obtained from fetal liver which take up residence in the murine bone marrow, effectively receiving a human bone marrow transplant and resulting in a range of human cells in peripheral blood, including mature T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, all of which show extensive infiltration of organs and tissues including liver, lung, and gastrointestinal tract. Following transplantation, a compound of the disclosure is administered to transplanted mice to inhibit the trafficking of human cells to the gastrointestinal tract, a major source of T cell/HIV interaction. Compound efficacy is measured as a reduction in blood viral load by standard techniques.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Model of Arthritis
A 17-day study of type II collagen-induced arthritis is conducted to evaluate the effects of a modulator on arthritis-induced clinical ankle swelling. Rat collagen-induced arthritis is an experimental model of polyarthritis that has been widely used for preclinical testing of numerous anti-arthritic agents (see Trentham et al., J. Exp. Med. 146(3):857-868 (1977), Bendele et al., Toxicologic Pathol. 27:134-142 (1999), Bendele et al., Arthritis. Rheum. 42:498-506 (1999)). The hallmarks of this model are reliable onset and progression of robust, easily measurable polyarticular inflammation, marked cartilage destruction in association with pannus formation and mild to moderate bone resorption and periosteal bone proliferation.
Female Lewis rats (approximately 0.2 kilograms) are anesthetized with isoflurane and injected with Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant containing 2 mg/mL bovine type II collagen at the base of the tail and two sites on the back on days 0 and 6 of this 17-day study. The test modulator is dosed daily by sub-cutaneous injection from day 9 to day 17 at a dose of 100 mg/kg and a volume of 1 mL/kg in the following vehicle (24.5% Cremaphore EL, 24.5% common oil, 1% Benzylalcohol and 50% Distilled water). Caliper measurements of the ankle joint diameter are taken daily, and reducing joint swelling is taken as a measure of efficacy.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Model of Ulcerative Colitis
The MDR1a-knockout mice, which lack the P-glycoprotein gene, spontaneously develop colitis under specific pathogen-free condition. The pathology in these animals has been characterized as Th1-type T cell-mediated inflammation similar to ulcerative colitis in humans. Disease normally begins to develop at around 8-10 weeks after birth. However the ages at which disease emerges and the ultimate penetrance level often vary considerably among different animal facilities.
In a study using the MDR1a-knockout mice, a CCR(9) antagonist of the disclosure was evaluated by prophylactic administration for its ability to delay disease onset. Female mice (n=34) were dosed with 10-100 mg/kg once a day by subcutaneous injections for 14 consecutive weeks starting at age 10 weeks. The study was evaluated for IBD-associated growth retardation, and the tested compound was shown to be efficacious in this model.
Evaluation of a Test Modulator in a Mouse Model of Asthma
This example describes a procedure to evaluate the efficacy of antagonists for treatment of asthma. An animal model of asthma can be induced by sensitizing rodents to an experimental antigen (e.g. OVA) by standard immunization, and subsequently introducing that same antigen into the rodents lung by aerosolization. Three series of rodent groups, comprising 10 rodents per group, are actively sensitized on Day 0 by a single i.p. injection with 100 ug OVA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), along with an adjuvant e.g. aluminum hydroxide. At 11 days after sensitization, the animals are placed in a Plexiglas chamber and challenged with aerosolized OVA (1%) for 30 minutes using the ultrasonic nebulizer (De Vilbliss). One series of mice additionally receives PBS and Tween 0.5% i.p. at the initial sensitization, and at different dosing schedules thereafter, up until the aerosolized OVA challenge. A second series consists of groups of mice receiving different doses of the CCR4 antagonist given either intraperitoneally, intra-venously, sub-cutaneously, intra-muscularly, orally, or via any other mode of administration at the initial sensitization, and at different dosing schedules thereafter, up until the aerosolized OVA challenge. A third series of mice, serving as positive control, consists of groups treated with either mouse IL-10 i.p., anti-IL4 antibodies i.p., or anti-IL5 antibodies i.p. at the initial sensitization, and at different dosing schedules thereafter, up until the aerosolized OV A challenge. Animals are subsequently analyzed at different time points after the aerosolized OVA challenge for pulmonary function, cellular infiltrates in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), histological examination of lungs, and measurement of serum OVA specific IgE titers.
It is therefore intended that the foregoing detailed description be regarded as illustrative rather than limiting, and that it be understood that it is the following claims, including all equivalents, that are intended to define the spirit and scope of this disclosure.
