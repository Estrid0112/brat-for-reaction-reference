BACKGROUND
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and related diseases are a major public health problem worldwide. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) encodes three enzymes which are required for viral replication: reverse transcriptase, protease, and integrase. Although drugs targeting reverse transcriptase and protease are in wide use and have shown effectiveness, particularly when employed in combination, toxicity and development of resistant strains have limited their usefulness (Palella, et al N. Engl. J. Med. (1998) 338:853-860; Richman, D. D. Nature (2001) 410:995-1001).
Accordingly, there is a need for new agents that inhibit the replication of HIV. There is also a need for agents that are directed against alternate sites in the viral life cycle including agents that target the integrase enzyme. There is also a need for new agents with appropriate levels of metabolic stability.
SUMMARY
The present invention encompasses the recognition that there exists a need for new compounds and methods for treating HIV infection. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I:

Protecting Groups
In the context of the present disclosure, protecting groups include prodrug moieties and chemical protecting groups.
Protecting group: As used herein, the phrase “protecting group” refers to a moiety of a compound that masks or alters the properties of a functional group or the properties of the compound as a whole. Chemical protecting groups and strategies for protection/deprotection are well known in the art. See e.g., Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Theodora W. Greene, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1991. Protecting groups are often utilized to mask the reactivity of certain functional groups, to assist in the efficiency of desired chemical reactions, e.g., making and breaking chemical bonds in an ordered and planned fashion. Protection of functional groups of a compound alters other physical properties besides the reactivity of the protected functional group, such as the polarity, lipophilicity (hydrophobicity), and other properties which can be measured by common analytical tools. Chemically protected intermediates may themselves be biologically active or inactive.
Protected compounds may also exhibit altered, and in some cases, optimized properties in vitro and in vivo, such as passage through cellular membranes and resistance to enzymatic degradation or sequestration. In this role, protected compounds with intended therapeutic effects may be referred to as prodrugs. Another function of a protecting group is to convert the parental drug into a prodrug, whereby the parental drug is released upon conversion of the prodrug in vivo. Because active prodrugs may be absorbed more effectively than the parental drug, prodrugs may possess greater potency in vivo than the parental drug. Protecting groups are removed either in vitro, in the instance of chemical intermediates, or in vivo, in the case of prodrugs. With chemical intermediates, it is not particularly important that the resulting products after deprotection, e.g., alcohols, be physiologically acceptable, although in general it is more desirable if the products are pharmacologically innocuous.
Protecting groups are available, commonly known and used, and are optionally used to prevent side reactions with the protected group during synthetic procedures, i.e. routes or methods to prepare the compounds of the invention. For the most part the decision as to which groups to protect, when to do so, and the nature of the chemical protecting group “PG” will be dependent upon the chemistry of the reaction to be protected against (e.g., acidic, basic, oxidative, reductive or other conditions) and the intended direction of the synthesis. Protecting groups do not need to be, and generally are not, the same if the compound is substituted with multiple protecting groups. In general, protecting groups will be used to protect functional groups such as carboxyl, hydroxyl, thio, or amino groups and to thus prevent side reactions or to otherwise facilitate the synthetic efficiency. The order of deprotection to yield free deprotected groups is dependent upon the intended direction of the synthesis and the reaction conditions to be encountered, and may occur in any order as determined by the artisan.
Various functional groups of the compounds of the invention may be protected. For example, protecting groups for -OH groups (whether hydroxyl, carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, or other functions) include “ether- or ester-forming groups”. Ether- or ester-forming groups are capable of functioning as chemical protecting groups in the synthetic schemes set forth herein. However, some hydroxyl and thio protecting groups are neither ether- nor ester-forming groups, as will be understood by those skilled in the art, and are included with amides, discussed below.
A very large number of hydroxyl protecting groups and amide-forming groups and corresponding chemical cleavage reactions are described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Theodora W. Greene (John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 1991, ISBN 0-471-62301-6) (“Greene”). See also Kocienski, Philip J.; Protecting Groups (Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1994), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein. In particular Chapter 1, Protecting Groups: An Overview, pages 1-20, Chapter 2, Hydroxyl Protecting Groups, pages 21-94, Chapter 3, Diol Protecting Groups, pages 95-117, Chapter 4, Carboxyl Protecting Groups, pages 118-154, Chapter 5, Carbonyl Protecting Groups, pages 155-184. For protecting groups for carboxylic acid, phosphonic acid, phosphonate, sulfonic acid and other protecting groups for acids see Greene.
Stereoisomers
Compounds of the invention may have chiral centers, e.g., chiral carbon or phosphorus atoms. In some embodiments, compounds of the invention include mixtures of all stereoisomers, including enantiomers, diastereomers, and atropisomers.
Chiral: As used herein, the term “chiral” refers to molecules which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner, while the term “achiral” refers to molecules which are superimposable on their mirror image partner.
Diastereoisomer: As used herein, the term “diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two or more centers or axes of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers typically have different physical properties, e.g., melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis and chromatography.
Enantiomer: As used herein, the term “enantiomer” refers to two stereoisomers of a compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another.
Stereoisomers: As used herein, the term “stereoisomers” refers to compounds which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.
In some embodiments, compounds of the present invention exist as atropisomers. For example, atropisomers can exist when R4 of Formula I is, e.g., phenyl, and certain substitution patterns are present on the phenyl ring, with such chirality occurring at the site indicated below with an asterisk:
<img> id-US20180118734A1-20180503-C00010.TIF </img>

One skilled in the art will recognize that substituents and other moieties of the compounds disclosed herein should be selected in order to provide a compound which is sufficiently stable to provide a pharmaceutically useful compound which can be formulated into an acceptably stable pharmaceutical composition. Compounds disclosed herein which have such stability are contemplated as falling within the scope of the present invention.
It is to be understood that for compounds disclosed herein when a bond is drawn in a non-stereochemical manner (e.g. flat) the atom to which the bond is attached includes all stereochemical possibilities. It is also to be understood that when a bond is drawn in a stereochemical manner (e.g. bold, bold-wedge, dashed or dashed-wedge) the atom to which the stereochemical bond is attached has the stereochemistry as shown unless otherwise noted.
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes (D and L) or (R and S) are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and 1 or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or 1 meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they are mirror images of one another. A specific stereoisomer may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “racemate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity.
In some embodiments, compounds of the invention include enriched or resolved optical isomers at any or all asymmetric, chiral atoms. In other words, in some embodiments, one or more chiral centers apparent from the depictions are provided as chiral isomers or racemic mixtures. Both racemic and diastereomeric mixtures, as well as individual optical isomers isolated or synthesized, substantially free of their enantiomeric or diastereomeric partners, are all within the scope of the invention. Racemic mixtures can be separated into individual, substantially optically pure isomers through well-known techniques such as, for example, separation of diastereomeric salts formed with optically active adjuncts, e.g., acids or bases followed by conversion back to the optically active substances. In some embodiments, a desired optical isomer is synthesized by means of stereospecific reactions, beginning with an appropriate stereoisomer of a desired starting material.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein can also exist as tautomeric isomers. Although only one delocalized resonance structure may be depicted, all such forms are contemplated within the scope of the invention. For example, ene-amine tautomers can exist for purine, pyrimidine, imidazole, guanidine, amidine, and tetrazole systems and all their possible tautomeric forms are within the scope of the invention.

Prodrugs
In some embodiments, a prodrug of a compound described herein is provided. A “prodrug” is defined in the pharmaceutical field as a biologically inactive derivative of a drug that upon administration to the human body is converted to the biologically active parent drug according to some chemical or enzymatic pathway. Prodrugs include, for instance, a compound that when administered to a biological system generates a compound of the invention that inhibits the replication of HIV (“the active inhibitory compound”). Such a compound may be formed from the prodrug as a result of, for example: (i) spontaneous chemical reaction(s), (ii) enzyme catalyzed chemical reaction(s), (iii) photolysis, and/or (iv) metabolic chemical reaction(s).
“Prodrug moiety” refers to a labile functional group which separates from an active inhibitory compound during metabolism, systemically, inside a cell, by hydrolysis, enzymatic cleavage, or by some other process (Bundgaard, Hans, “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development (1991), P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Eds. Harwood Academic Publishers, pp. 113-191). Enzymes which are capable of an enzymatic activation mechanism with prodrug compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, amidases, esterases, microbial enzymes, phospholipases, cholinesterases, and phosphases. Prodrug moieties can serve to enhance solubility, absorption and lipophilicity to optimize drug delivery, bioavailability and efficacy. A prodrug moiety may include an active metabolite or drug itself.
Exemplary prodrug moieties include hydrolytically sensitive or labile acyloxymethyl esters -CH2OC(═O)R99 and acyloxymethyl carbonates -CH2OC(═O)OR99 where R99 is C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 substituted alkyl, C6-C20 aryl or C6-C20 substituted aryl. Acyloxyalkyl esters were first used as a prodrug strategy for carboxylic acids and then applied to phosphates and phosphonates by Farquhar et al. (1983) J. Pharm. Sci. 72: 24; also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,816,570, 4,968,788, 5,663,159 and 5,792,756. Subsequently, acyloxyalkyl esters were used to deliver phosphonic acids across cell membranes and to enhance oral bioavailability. A close variant of acyloxyalkyl esters, i.e., alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl esters (carbonates), may also enhance oral bioavailability as prodrug moieties for use in combination with compounds of the invention. An exemplary acyloxymethyl ester is pivaloyloxymethoxy, (POM) -CH2OC(═O)C(CH3)3. An exemplary acyloxymethyl carbonate prodrug moiety is pivaloyloxymethylcarbonate (POC) -CH2OC(═O)OC(CH3)3.

Pharmaceutical Formulations
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are formulated with conventional carriers (e.g., inactive ingredient or excipient material) selected in accord with ordinary practice. In some embodiments, tablets contain excipients, including glidants, fillers, binders and the like. In some embodiments, aqueous formulations are prepared in sterile form. In some embodiments, such aqueous formulations are intended for delivery by other than oral administration and are isotonic. In some embodiments, formulations optionally contain excipients such as those set forth in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (1986). Excipients include, but are not limited to, ascorbic acid and other antioxidants, chelating agents such as EDTA, carbohydrates such as dextrin, hydroxyalkylcellulose, hydroxyalkylmethylcellulose, stearic acid and the like. In some embodiments, the present invention provides formulations in solid dosage form, for example, in solid oral dosage form.
In some embodiments, formulations may be specially formulated for administration in solid or liquid form, including those adapted for the following: oral administration, for example, drenches (aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets, e.g., those targeted for buccal, sublingual, and systemic absorption, boluses, powders, granules, pastes for application to the tongue; or parenteral administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous or epidural injection as, for example, a sterile solution or suspension, or sustained-release formulation.
While it is possible for the active ingredients to be administered alone it may be preferable to present them as pharmaceutical formulations (compositions). The formulations, both for veterinary and for human use, of the invention comprise at least one active ingredient, together with one or more acceptable carriers and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and physiologically innocuous to the recipient thereof.
Formulations include those suitable for the foregoing administration routes. In some embodiments, formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Techniques and formulations generally are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa.). Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the inactive ingredients (e.g., a carrier, pharmaceutical excipients, etc.) which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In some embodiments, formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product.
In some embodiments, formulations described herein that are suitable for oral administration are presented as discrete units including, but not limited to, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations disclosed herein comprise one or more compounds described herein together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients and optionally other therapeutic agents. Pharmaceutical formulations containing the active ingredient may be in any form suitable for the intended method of administration. When used for oral use for example, tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oil suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, syrups or elixirs may be prepared. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents including sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents, in order to provide a palatable preparation. Tablets containing the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipient which are suitable for manufacture of tablets are acceptable. These excipients may be, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium or sodium carbonate, lactose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, calcium or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, such as maize starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, such as cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. Tablets may be uncoated or may be coated by known techniques including microencapsulation to delay disintegration and adsorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax may be employed.
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more inactive ingredients to produce a dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, in some embodiments, a dosage form for oral administration to humans contains approximately 1 to 1000 mg of active material formulated with an appropriate amount of carrier material (e.g., inactive ingredient or excipient material). In certain embodiments, the carrier material varies from about 5% to about 95% of the total composition (weight:weight).
It should be understood that, in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, formulations of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents.
In some embodiments, the present invention provides veterinary compositions comprising at least one active ingredient as above defined together with a veterinary carrier.
Veterinary carriers are materials useful for the purpose of administering the composition and may be solid, liquid or gaseous materials which are otherwise inert or acceptable in the veterinary art and are compatible with the active ingredient. These veterinary compositions may be administered orally, parenterally or by any other desired route.
Effective dose of active ingredient depends at least on the nature of the condition being treated, toxicity, whether a compound is being used prophylactically (lower doses), the method of delivery, and the pharmaceutical formulation, and will be determined by the clinician using conventional dose escalation studies.
Routes of Administration
One or more compounds described herein (herein referred to as the active ingredients) are administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated. Suitable routes include oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intradermal, intrathecal and epidural), and the like. It will be appreciated that a preferred route may vary with, for example, the condition of the recipient. An advantage of the compounds of this invention is that they are orally bioavailable and can be dosed orally.
Identification and/or Characterization of Compounds/Compositions
The antiviral properties of a compound of the invention may be determined using the methods described below.
The specific pharmacological responses observed may vary according to and depending on the particular active compound selected or whether there are present pharmaceutical carriers, as well as the type of formulation and mode of administration employed, and such expected variations or differences in the results are contemplated in accordance with practice of the present invention.
The invention has been described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention.

Example 125: Compound Assays
Antiviral Assay in MT4 Cells
For the antiviral assay, 0.4 μL of 189X test concentration of 3-fold serially diluted compound in DMSO was added to 40 μL of cell growth medium (RPMI 1640, 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin, 1% L-Glutamine, 1% HEPES) in each well of 384-well plate (10 concentrations) in quadruplicate.
1 mL Aliquots of MT4 cells were pre-infected for 3 hours at 37° C. with 25 μL of cell growth medium (mock-infected) or a fresh 1:250 dilution of an HIV-IIIb (wildtype, IN T174I BT, or IN T174I DE) concentrated ABI stock (0.004 m.o.i.). IN T174I BT virus was derived from viral breakthrough (BT) assay as described in Mulato, A.; Hansen, D.; Thielen, A.; Porter, D.; Stepan, G.; White, K.; Daeumer, M.; Cihlar, T.; Yant, S. R. AIDS Research and Human Retrovirues, July 2016, ahead of print. doi:10.1089/aid.2016.0071. IN T174I DE virus was derived from serial passaging with dose escalation (DE) of test compound. Infected and uninfected cells were diluted in cell growth media and 35 μL (2000 cells) was added to each well of the assay plates.
Assay plates were then maintained in a humidified, 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. After 5 days of incubation, 25 μl of 2× concentrated CellTiter-Glo™ Reagent (catalog # G7573, Promega Biosciences, Inc., Madison, Wis.) was added to each well of the assay plate. Cell lysis was carried out by incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes and then chemiluminescence was read using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). EC50 values were calculated as the compound concentration that caused a 50% decrease in luminescence signal, a measure of HIV-1 replication.

All references, including publications, patents, and patent documents are incorporated by reference herein, as though individually incorporated by reference. The invention has been described with reference to various specific and preferred embodiments and techniques. However, it should be understood that many variations and modifications may be made while remaining within the spirit and scope of the invention.
The use of the terms “a” and “an” and “the” and similar references in the context of this disclosure (especially in the context of the following claims) are to be construed to cover both the singular and the plural, unless otherwise indicated herein or clearly contradicted by context. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., such as, preferred, preferably) provided herein, is intended merely to further illustrate the content of the disclosure and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the claims. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element as essential to the practice of the present disclosure.
Alternative embodiments of the claimed disclosure are described herein, including the best mode known to the inventors for practicing the claimed invention. Of these, variations of the disclosed embodiments will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading the foregoing disclosure. The inventors expect skilled artisans to employ such variations as appropriate (e.g., altering or combining features or embodiments), and the inventors intend for the invention to be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.
Accordingly, this invention includes all modifications and equivalents of the subject matter recited in the claims appended hereto as permitted by applicable law. Moreover, any combination of the above described elements in all possible variations thereof is encompassed by the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context.
The use of individual numerical values is stated as approximations as though the values were preceded by the word “about” or “approximately.” Similarly, the numerical values in the various ranges specified in this application, unless expressly indicated otherwise, are stated as approximations as though the minimum and maximum values within the stated ranges were both preceded by the word “about” or “approximately.” In this manner, variations above and below the stated ranges can be used to achieve substantially the same results as values within the ranges. As used herein, the terms “about” and “approximately” when referring to a numerical value shall have their plain and ordinary meanings to a person of ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosed subject matter is most closely related or the art relevant to the range or element at issue. The amount of broadening from the strict numerical boundary depends upon many factors. For example, some of the factors which may be considered include the criticality of the element and/or the effect a given amount of variation will have on the performance of the claimed subject matter, as well as other considerations known to those of skill in the art. As used herein, the use of differing amounts of significant digits for different numerical values is not meant to limit how the use of the words “about” or “approximately” will serve to broaden a particular numerical value or range. Thus, as a general matter, “about” or “approximately” broaden the numerical value. Also, the disclosure of ranges is intended as a continuous range including every value between the minimum and maximum values plus the broadening of the range afforded by the use of the term “about” or “approximately.” Thus, recitation of ranges of values herein are merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range, unless otherwise indicated herein, and each separate value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein.
It is to be understood that any ranges, ratios and ranges of ratios that can be formed by, or derived from, any of the data disclosed herein represent further embodiments of the present disclosure and are included as part of the disclosure as though they were explicitly set forth. This includes ranges that can be formed that do or do not include a finite upper and/or lower boundary. Accordingly, a person of ordinary skill in the art most closely related to a particular range, ratio or range of ratios will appreciate that such values are unambiguously derivable from the data presented herein.
