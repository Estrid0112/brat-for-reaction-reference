FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a series of Janus kinase inhibitors, in particular to compounds of Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
JAK belongs to a family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6. The present invention also provides methods for the production of the compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, methods for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of diseases involving inflammation, autoimmune diseases, proliferative diseases, transplant rejection, diseases involving impairment of cartilage turnover, congenital cartilage malformations and/or diseases associated with hypersecretion of IL6 by administering a compound of the present invention.
Janus kinases (JAK) are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine signaling from membrane receptors to STAT transcription factors. Four JAK family members are described in the prior art: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2. Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, JAK family members auto- and/or transphosphorylate each other, followed by phosphorylation of STATs and then migrate to the nucleus to modulate transcription. JAK-STAT intracellular signal transduction is suitable for the interferons, most interleukins, as well as a variety of cytokines and endocrine factors such as EPO, TPO, GH, OSM, LIF, CNTF, GM-CSF and PRL (Vainchenker W. et al. (2008)).
The combination of genetic models and small molecule JAK inhibitor research revealed the therapeutic potential of several JAKs. JAK3 is validated by mouse and human genetics as an immune-suppression target (O'Shea J.et al. (2004)). JAK3 inhibitors were successful taken into clinical development, initially for organ transplant rejection but later also in other immuno-inflammatory indications such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and Crohn's diseases (http://clinicaltrials.gov/). TYK2 is a potential target for immuno-inflammatory diseases, being validated by human genetics and mouse knock-out studies (Levy D. and Loomis C.(2007)). JAK1 is a new target in the immuno-inflammatory disease area. JAK1 heterodimerizes with other JAKs to transduce cytokine-driven pro-inflammatory signaling. Therefore, it is expected that inhibition of JAK1 and other JAKs are a therapeutic benefit for a series of inflammatory diseases and other diseases driven by JAK-mediated signal transduction.

Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
Preferably, the neutral forms of the compounds may be regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compound in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" belongs to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by converting an existing acid or base to its salt form. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but not limited to, inorganic or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compounds formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include, but not limited to, those derived from salts of inorganic or organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, hydroxy, hydroxynaphthoic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicylic, stearic, subacetic, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric, tannic, tartaric, and p-toluenesulfonic acids.

Optically-active (R)-and (S)- enantiomers, and D-, and L-isomers may be prepared by chiral synthesis, or by chiral reagents, or by any other conventional techniques. If an enantiomer of a certain compound of the present invention is desired, it may be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivation with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantionmers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as amino, or an acidic functional group, such as carboxyl, diastereomeric salts are formed with an appropriate optically-active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by resolution means well known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantionmers. Additionally, the separation of the enantionmers and diastereomers can be generally accomplished by using chromatography which using chiral stationary phase and optionally in combination with a chemical derivatization method (e.g. the formation of carbamates from amines).
The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be labeled by using radioactive isotopes, such as tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I), or carbon-14 (14C).

These matrices include suspending agents, tackifiers, transdermal enhancers, and the like, the formulations of which are well known to those skilled person in the art of cosmetics or local medicines. Regarding additional information about the carriers, refer to the content in "Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005)" which are hereby incorporated by reference.
The term "excipient" generally refers to the carrier, diluent and/or medium required by preparation of an effective pharmaceutical composition.
For the drug or pharmacologically active agent, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. For the oral dosage in the present invention, the "effective amount" of an active substance in the composition refers to the amount required to achieve the desired effect when used in combination with another active substance in the composition. The effective amount will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of the individual, depending on the particular active agent as well. An appropriate "effective" amount in any individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art in accordance with conventional experimentation.
The terms "active ingredient", "therapeutic agent", "active substance" or "active agent" mean a chemical entity which is effective in treating a target disorder, disease or condition.
The term "substituted" means that any one or more hydrogen atoms on the designated atom is replaced with substituent, provided that the designated atom's valency is normal, and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When the substituent is keto (i.e.,=O), then two hydrogen atoms are substituted. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The term "optionally substituted" means that it may be substituted or may not be substituted, unless specified otherwise, the type and number of substituents may be optionally on the chemically achievable basis.
When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than one time in constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-2 R, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
When the number of a linking group is 0, such as -(CRR)0-, it indicates that the linking group is a single bond.
When one of the variables is selected from a single bond, it indicates that the two groups to which they are attached are directly connected, for example, when L in A-L-Z represents a single bond, the structure is actually A-Z.
When a substituent is vacant, it indicates that the substituent is absent, for example, when X is vacant in A-X, it means that the structure is actually A. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. For example, the structural unitorindicates that it can be substituted at any position on the cyclohexyl group or the cyclohexadiene group.
Unless specified otherwise, the term "hetero" means a heteroatom or heteroatom radical (i.e., an atomic radical containing a heteroatom), including atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), and atomic radical containing such heteroatoms, for example, including oxygen(O), nitrogen(N), sulfur(S), silicon(Si), germanium(Ge), aluminum(Al), boron(B), -O-, -S-, =O, =S, -C(=O)O-, -C(C=O)-, -S(=O), -S(=O)2-, and optionally substituted -C(=O)N(H)-, -N(H)-, -C(=NH)-, -S(=O)2N(H)- or -S(=O)N(H)-.

The ring includes monocyclic ring, bicyclic ring, spiro ring, or bridged ring. The number of atoms on the ring is usually defined as the number of membered ring, for example, "5- to 7-membered ring" refers to the surrounding arrangement of 5 to 7 atoms. Unless specified otherwise, the ring optionally contains from 1 to 3 heteroatoms. Thus, the term "5- to 7-membered ring" includes such as phenyl, pyridyl and piperidinyl. On the other hand, the term "5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring" includes pyridyl and piperidinyl, but does not include phenyl. The term "cyclo" also includes cyclic system containing at least one ring, in which each "cyclo" independently meets the above definition.
Unless specified otherwise, the term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclic group" is intended to mean a stable monocyclic or bicyclic or tricyclic ring, including heteroatom or heteroatom radical, which is saturated, partially unsaturated or fully unsaturated (aromatic), and which consists of carbon atoms and from 1, 2, 3 or 4 cyclic heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S; and including any bicyclic group in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings is fused to a benzene ring. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (NO, and S(O)p, p represents 1 or 2). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its pendant group at any heteroatom or carbon atom which results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic ring described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resulting compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. It is preferred that when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. It is preferred that the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocyclic system" or "heteroaryl group" is intended to mean a stable 5, 6, 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic ring, and which consists of carbon atoms and from 1, 2, 3 or 4 cyclic heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S.
