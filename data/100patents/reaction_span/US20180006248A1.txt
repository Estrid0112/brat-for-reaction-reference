FIELD OF INVENTION
The present disclosure relates to porphyrin small molecules useful for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) applications. Provided are synthesized materials that can have strong and ordered self-assembly properties, leading to form bi-continuous, interpenetrating networks which can be used for efficient charge separation and transport in organic solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on the embodiments described herein can have high PCE relative to traditional solution-processed BHJ solar cell devices based on porphyrin small molecules.
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
Solution-processed organic photovoltaics have been recognized as one of the most promising alternative next-generation green technologies to inorganic solar cells. They have drawn much attention due, in part, to their potential eco-friendliness and low-cost conversion of solar energy to clean electricity due to, e.g., their solution processability, light weight and flexibility of organic solar cells (OSCs).
As a result of the remarkable improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 13.2% that have been achieved for single-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer OSCs, small molecule (SM) BHJ OSCs are under intense study recently.
Small molecule OSCs have several advantages over single-junction BHJ polymer OSCs. Such advantages include, e.g., defined molecular structure and molecular weight, high purity, and good batch-to-batch reproducibility of small molecules in comparison with their polymer counterparts.
These properties have the potential to allow researchers to better understand the relationships between the molecular structures and device performance. They may also provide a path to design higher performance photovoltaic materials and finally realize commercial applications especially when the PCEs solution-processed small molecule based solar cells have increased dramatically up to 10% for single layer cells structure, which is closing the gap to the much widely investigated polymer based solar cells.
Inspired by the natural photosynthetic systems which utilize chlorophylls to absorb light and carry out photochemical charge separation to store light energy, porphyrins and their derivatives have been explored as the active materials from the beginning of OSC studies. However, the PCEs of the BHJ OSCs based on them have traditionally been very low.
It is an objective of the present disclosure to provide materials for building BHJ OSC to achieve higher PCEs.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The present disclosure is further illustrated by the following experiments and embodiments. It should be understood that the subject matter disclosed in the experiments and embodiments are used for illustrative purpose are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) have been well studied and recognized as one of the most promising next-generation green technology alternatives to inorganic solar cells, because of their solution processability, low cost, light weight, and high flexibility.
In the last decade, there has been intense research on developing new organic semi-conducting materials, including polymers and small molecules for BHJ photovoltaic devices. Though great progress has been made for polymeric electron donor material, recent studies show that polymers are not the single approach to achieve a suitable interpenetrating network and thereby a high performance OPV deice, since intrinsic batch to batch variation issue could hamper the performance reproducibility. In contrast small molecules organic solar cell devices demonstrate many prominent advantages, as could be synthesized with certain structure, easily tuned absorptions and energy levels resulting from a dedicated chemical structure design, have defined molar weight, can be obtained in batch to batch variations. (A. Shah, P. Torres, et al., Science, 1999, 285, 692; G. Li, R. Zhu, Y. Yang, Nat. Photonics, 2012, 6, 153.)
In dye-sensitized solar porphyrin-based push-pull photosensitizers have demonstrated their potential as large and rigid planar conjugated structures, which can enhance the π-electron delocalization and promote intermolecular π-π interaction, as well as charge transport in devices. (E. Dietel, et al., Chem. Commun., 1998, 1981; S. Mathew, et al., Nat. Chem., 2014, 6, 242; A. Yella, et al., Science, 2011, 334, 629.) However, porphyrin-based polymers or small molecules (SM) have less contribution in BHJ OSC, and the main performance impediments are the unfavorable aggregation, short exciton diffusion length and the low charge mobility. (J. Hatano, et al., J. Mater. Chem., 2012, 22, 19258; L. L. Li, and E. W. G. Diau, Chem. Soc. Rev., 2013, 42, 291; C. L. Mai, et al., Chem. Commun., 2010, 46, 809.) Recently, the inventors employed A-π-D-π-A A strategy to synthesize porphyrin organic photovoltaic materials demonstrating that porphyrins are promising OSCs. However, porphyrin-based light-harvesting donor materials still remained underexposed in bulk heterojunction OSC. And it is very challenging to achieve a balance between solubility and intermolecular interactions for porphyrin molecules, simultaneously targeting optimally positioned energy levels (to ensure a high VOC) and increased solar flux coverage (to ensure, a high JSC) and charge carrier mobility (to ensure a high FF). Also the inventors believe that porphyrin-based small molecules should play more important roles in BHJ OSCs due to high molar absorption coefficients, easy chemical structure modification and unique photophysical properties, which motivate the inventors to design new molecules to better understand the structure-property-function relationships and improve the performance of OSCs.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs are based on a solution processed active layer blend composed of an organic electron donating and an electron accepting material. The BHJ OSCs working processes are described as follow. The first step is light absorption of blend to form an exciton. Then, the singlet excitons diffuse to the interface to form interfacial charge transfer (CT) excited state species that then dissociate into free holes and electrons. The free charges then move to the respective electrodes, and photo-current Comes from the extraction of the charge carrier. The simplified working mechanism of an OPV device involves four distinct events: (i) optical absorption and formation of excitons, (ii) exciton diffusion to the donor-acceptor interface, (iii) exciton dissociation at the donor-acceptor interface, and (iv) charge collection at the electrodes. These four steps are significantly influenced by the morphology, structure, unique physical and chemical properties of the materials. (C. J. Brabec, et al., Adv Funct. Mater., 2001, 11, 15; S. Günes, et al., Chem. Rev., 2007, 107, 1324; Y.-J. Cheng, et al., Chem. Rev., 2009, 109, 5868.)
The diffusion of excitons to the active interface thus plays a critical role in organic solar cells. In order to make a contribution to the photocurrent, the exciton diffusion length in a good organic solar cell must at least be in the order of magnitude of the typical penetration depth of light, in order that the predominant portion of the light can be utilized. Organic crystals or thin layers which are perfect in terms of structure and with regard to chemical purity do indeed satisfy this criterion. Solution-processed organic solar cells based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends have drawn much attention in recent years as a promising alternative green energy complimentary to silicon technologies. Impressively, small-molecular (SM) active materials have been fast developed for the least batch-to-batch variation in physical and optoelectronic properties, and the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) single-junction small-area devices reach 10%. (Q. Zhan, et al., Nat. Photonics, 2014, 9, 35; B. Kan, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2014, 136, 15529.) Among them, porphyrins as one unique family have also been successfully demonstrated as active materials because of their superior light-harvesting capability in the visible region and freely tunable photophysical and photochemical properties by facile structural modification. Though porphyrin-based donor materials have demonstrated their enormous potentiality in photovoltaic applications with outstanding performance, porphyrin based materials are disadvantaged by the lack of light-harvesting beyond 850 nm, thus limiting their cell performances. Since 50% of the total solar photon flux is located in the red and near-infrared (NIR) spectra (600˜1000 nm), its quite urgent to develop efficient NIR absorbing molecules for high performance organic solar cells.
The current status and limitations of research provided motivation to develop a new class of conjugated porphyrin to optimize light absorption and energy level, with the highlight of pushing light absorption into near infrared region, and developing highly efficient NIR organic solar cells (OSCs).
The performance of A-π-D-π-A type porphyrin-based small molecules strongly depends on the molecular structure. Because this is one of the important aspects to control the film morphology and crystallinity, thus enhancement of intermolecular charge transport and consequently higher fill factor. In addition, the materials should possess lower-lying HOMO energy level to get higher open-circuit voltage (VOC), since VOC of bulk heterojunction generally proportional to the gap between the HOMO of donor and the LUMO of the acceptor. On the other hand, suitable and matching energy levels of donor and acceptor are essential for efficient excitons dissociation in the photoactive layers for higher JSC. Therefore, broadening the absorption and effectively tuning the HOMO energy levels of the porphyrin-based small molecules are crucial for designing high-efficiency donor materials. Several strategies have been exploited to address this issue, such as replacement of different acceptor (A2) units, expanding the length of π bridge and side chains engineering of the conjugated structures. One of the promising approaches to enhance, orbital coupling is to use molecules that extended π-conjugated structure. Meanwhile, controlling the π-conjugated length of backbones also can tune optoelectronic properties, intermolecular interaction, and solubility. These properties are expected to fulfill the various requirements the device fabrication in solution-processed BHJ OSCs.
Devices based on porphyrin donors show efficient photocurrent response from 300-850 nm, indicating that there is yet plenty of space to further widen the light-harvesting region. To achieve better performance, an attempt on fusion of π-extended porphyrin can further improve the device performance with the following considerations: 1) extended π-electron conjugation systems with even stronger light-harvesting abilities both in the visible and the near-infrared region; 2) ample intermolecular interactions for efficient charge transfer, thus enhanced charge mobility; 3) well-defined and rigid molecular structures to ensure molecular ordered arrangement in solid state; 4) flexible side chains can ensure the high level of solubility and suppress molecular aggregation. Also, the physical properties of expanded porphyrin small molecules was investigated by various experimental methods, and superior light harvesting ability towards the near-infrared region exhibit a remarkable feature because it might be adopted into the system of ternary or tandem organic solar cells to improve the device performance.
Described herein, is the design and preparation of a series of porphyrin small molecules based on four different type structure architectures as below (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 and Type 4), in which electron transport groups (Ar1 and Ar2) were conjugated meso-ethynyl porphyrin core, and then ended with electron-acceptor terminal units (A1, A2 and A3), respectively, in certain embodiments, the electron transport groups (Ar1 and Ar2) are symmetrically conjugated to meso-ethynyl porphyrin core.
In certain embodiments, Type 1 porphyrin donors extend the backbone conjugation and enhance intermolecular π-π interaction by different electron transport groups (Ar1), in which the metalloporphyrin core was linked, e.g., symmetrically, with Ar1 via an acetylene bridge and ended with acceptor terminal units (A2). The conjugation of π groups not only effectively increase the solar flux coverage between the conventional Soret and Q bands, but also enhanced the directional intermolecular π-π stacking in films together with two aliphatic substitutions instead of aromatic meso-substitions on porphyrin core. The blended films with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are characteristic of bi-continuous, interpenetrating networks required for efficient charge separation and transportation. Therefore, developing new porphyrin materials for blend film is critical for widespread application of organic solar cells.
Although porphyrin derivatives are a favorable choice for producing high performance solar cells, limited empirical research to investigate the relationship of PCE and structure optimizations has been done. On the contrary, side chain engineering is usually done in the establishment of high-performance OSCs; especially in benzodithiophene (BDT) based polymers. In comparison to the introduction of new or different building blocks conjugated to the porphyrin to tune the energy levels and surface morphology, optimizing side-chains offers an ideal route to optimize materials. As the simple and effective method in tuning solubility, optical absorption, thermal stability, photostability and crystallinity, the various of side chains are being recognized as an important factor determine the exciton diffusion, charge separation, and charge transport properties, but there are less correlation studies focused on the porphyrin unit. Hence, we explored the different peripheral substitutions (A1) substituted on porphyrin ring to finely tune its physical and chemical properties.
Type 2 porphyrin donors expand the π-conjugation based on the Type 1, in which the peripheral substitutions (A1) connect to porphyrin ring via an acetylene bridge. It is also believed that the selection of appropriate peripheral substitutions could balance the solubility of small molecules in common organic solvent and the self-assemble property, as well as morphology of blend films. Type 3 porphyrin donors are tethered via ethynyl linker (Ar1), and ended with electron deficient group (A2) via the second ethynyl linker (Ar2). Moreover, side chain substitutions (A1) can be readily introduced to the orthogonal position in porphyrins to manipulate material solubility and solid-state packing. Additionally, Type 4 porphyrin donors are based on the coupling several porphyrin macrocycles (m=1, 2, 3, 4 . . . ) through an ethynyl linker, which is an effective way to extend the absorption of a porphyrin toward deep-absorption region. Besides, employing meso-meso linked porphyrin molecules can improve extinction coefficients regularly with the strong exciton coupling between two porphyrin moieties and decrease the π-π* gap concomitantly with the increased π-conjugation, (C.-L. Mai, et al., Chem. Commun., 2010, 46, 809; H.-P. Wu, et al., Energy Environ. Sci., 2012, 5, 9843, J.-W. Shiu, et al., J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015, 3, 1417.)
Biologically important porphyrin derivatives in natural world are all metal porphyrins. Metal porphyrins have also received much attention in connection with their intrinsically interesting spectroscopic, magnetic, and electrochemical properties. So, substitution of the metal center (M) in porphyrin core was studied, which yielded very useful information about their electronic structure and optical spectra.

As shown in FIG. 1A, the absorption spectra of CS-I, CS-II and CS-III, measured in dilute chloroform (CHCl3) solution exhibits identical peak maxima at around 474, 505 and 698 nm with similar molar extinction coefficients of 1.6×10−5 cm−1. As shown in FIG. 1B, it should be noted that a strong and broad absorption in the region of 600 to 760 nm was observed due the characteristics of A-D-A molecular structure. Comparing to their spectra in solution, their thin films prepared by spin-coating from chlorobenzene solutions red-shift to 740 nm for Q bands. Obviously, the strong intermolecular π-π stacking of the molecules leads to a broader absorption from visible to near infrared (NIR) regions. Such an ordered packing of small molecules is in favor of achieving efficient charge mobility as discussed below. Besides, CS-I in solid film shows a broader absorption band that presumably comes from stronger intermolecular interactions.
The solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated utilizing PC71BM as the electron acceptor and three small molecules as the electron donors under a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)]-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene PFN/Al, and then measured under illumination. The ratio of small molecule donor and PC71BM was optimized to be 1:1 (w/w) and those blend films were processed with or without pyridine additive from chlorobenzene. The current density-voltage (J-V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in FIGS. 2A-2B, FIGS. 4 and 5A-5B, and the key device parameters are included in Table 1. A PCE of 3.19% with VOC=0.85 V, 8.41 mA cm31 2 and FF=44.79% was achieved for CS-I without pyridine additive (FIG. 3). With 3% pyridine as additive for the blend film, the device shows, a much improved photovoltaic performance with VOC=0.90 V, JSC=13.72 mA cm−2 and FF=52.12%, corresponding to a of 6.49% (FIG. 2A). The highly enhanced JSC originates from the change of molecular assembly of the zinc porphyrin in the specific solvent additive. As shown in FIG. 2B, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized device of 1:1 CS-I/PC71BM ratio with 3% pyridine and without pyridine additive (FIG. 4) was measured. Both the devices show a very wide range of photocurrent generation in the region of 300 to 850 nm, with the highest EQE value of 72.46% at 510 nm and 60.04% at 740 nm achieved for the device based on CS-I/PC71BM blend film with 3% pyridine additive. Unexpectedly, the performance of the device based on CS-II shows much inferior performance with a JSC of 6.29 mA cm−2, FF of 0.48 and PCE, of 2.53% (FIG. 2A). This result is due to the inefficient exciton splitting in accordance with the macroscopic phase separation (vide infra). As for CS-III, a comparable value of 0.87 V and a lower JSC of 10.50 mA cm−2 constrain PCE to 5.12% (FIG. 2A).

In summary, a series of new unsymmetrical push-pull A-D-A small molecules based on different 5,15-dialkylated porphyrin cores were designed and synthesized, which shows good solubility in common organic solvent, a broad absorption in the visible and NIR regions, a relatively high hole-mobility and good film-forming properties for solution processed BHJ OSC. Based on the blend film of CS-I/PC71BM spin-coated from a mixture with 3% pyridine in chlorobenzene, a high PCE of 6.49% was achieved (FIG. 2A). These primary results indicate that the A-D-A small molecules based on meso-alkyl directly substituted porphyrin core are new class of donor candidates for highly efficient BHJ OSCs.

The other materials were of the common commercial level and used as received. 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Ultrashield 400 Plus NMR spectrometer. High-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra were obtained with a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. UV-vis spectra of dilute solutions (1×10−5 M) of samples in dichloromethane (DCM) were recorded at room temperature (ca. 25° C.) using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Solid films for UV-vis spectroscopic analysis were obtained by spin-coating the molecule solutions onto a quartz substrate.
BHJ-OSC Device Fabrication
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction solar wells were fabricated as follows: Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and isopropyl alcohol. After treated with an oxygen plasma for 5 mins, 40 nm thick poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) layer was spin-coated on the ITO-coated glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s, the substrates were subsequently dried at 150° C. for 10 mins in air and then transferred to a N2-glovebox. The active layers were spun from solution of donor material and PC71BM at weight ratio of 1:1 (or other ratio) with an overall concentration of 32 mg/mL. The thicknesses of active layers were measured by a profilometer. The ultra-thin PFN layer was deposited by spin casting from a 0.02% (w/v) solution in methanol (from 2000 rpm for 30 s). Finally, Al (˜80 nm) was evaporated with a shadow mask as the top electrode. The effective area was measured to be 0.16 cm2.
Characterization and Measurement
The values of power conversion efficiency were determined from characteristics measured by a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit under AM 1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192). Masks made from laser beam cutting technology with a well-defined area of 0.16 cm2 were attached to define the effective area the accurate measurement. Solar simulator illumination intensity was determined using a monocrystal silicon reference cell (Hamamatsu S1133, with KG-5 color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) The active layer was spin coated from blend chloroform or chlorobenzene solutions with a weight ratio of donor materials and PC71BM at 1:1 (or other ratios) and then was placed in a glass pith dish containing 0.3 mL CHCl3 for 80 s for solvent vapor annealing. External quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the encapsulated devices were measured by using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan, China) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was determined by using a calibrated silicon photodiode.

Results and Discussion
Measurement
The absorption spectra of two molecules both in diluted chloroform solution and thin film were measured. As seen in FIG. 5A and Table 2, the two porphyrins similar absorption spectra (CS-IV and CS-V) with two absorption peaks at 464 and 682 nm in solution, which are the typical characteristics of ethynyl linked conjugated D-A porphyrins and can be ascribed to the π-π* transition of the conjugated backbones of Soret hand and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) of Q band, respectively. The ICT band is weaker and the wavelength is also shorter than those in phenylene ethynylene bridged porphyrins indicating the reduced ICT of the two molecules after the replacement of phenylenes with terthiophenes. And the similar absorption spectra of CS-IV and CS-V suggest that the ICT is similar in the two molecules though there are two additional 1,1-dicyanomethylene electron-withdrawing groups on CS-V.

As seen in FIG. 5B, the NIR peak at 682 nm of both CS-IV and CS-V in solution significantly red shifts to 760 nm with the appearance of vibronic shoulders at 700 nm in films. The optical band gaps, which are estimated from the onsets of the absorption spectra in film, are 1.45 and 1.52 eV for CS-V and CS-IV, respectively. It should be noted that their Q bands of 760 nm are intensified remarkably and they are even higher than the Soret bands in film while they are much lower than the Soret bands in solution, indicating the very effective intermolecular π-π stacking (self-assembly) in the condensed solid state. Comparing to the absorption spectra of the reported porphyrins with similar chemical structures in solution and in film, the inventors ascribed the stronger self-assembly to the elongated π backbones after the replacement of phenylene with terthiophene and the replacement of the bulky 2,6-dioctyloxylphenyl groups with 2-octylundecyl substituents at the meso positions of the porphyrins.
Solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated using CS-IV or CS-V as the electron donor material and PC71BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the electron acceptor material with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/PFN/Al (ITO: indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS: poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene), PFN: poly[(9,9-bis(3'-(N,N-dimethylamino)ropyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]).
During the fabrication of the devices, the inventors noticed that good CS-V blend films can be obtained by using chlorobenzene (CB) solution while only chloroform (CF) solution produces smooth films for CS-IV blends. Therefore, CB and CF were chosen as the solvents in device fabrication. The weight ratio of the donor to PC71BM were optimized to be 1:1 for CS-IV/PC71BM and 4:3 for CS-V/PC7BM (the inventors used different donor/PC71BM ratios (w/w) of 1:1.5, 1:1, 4:3 and 1:0.5 to optimize blend ratios). The active layer thickness was about 100 nm.

Table 3 Device performance of organic solar cells based on CS-IV/PC71BM (w/w=1:1) and CS-V/PC71BM (w/w=4:3) donor materials under different solvent vapor annealing.
The J-V curves of the devices are presented in FIG. 6, and their device parameters are summarized in Table 3. As shown in FIG. 6, PCEs of CS-IV based device were further improved to 7.66% under chloroform with 0.4% DIO as additives (short circuit current (JSC)=14.93 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC)=0.80, fill factor (FF)=)64.18%); and for CS-V based device, the PCEs were further improved to 8.21% under chlorobenzene with 0.4% DIO as additives (JSC=14.30 mA cm−2, VOC=0.82, FF=70.01%). The performance enhancement is contributed improved morphology and optical properties.
FIG. 7 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of optimized devices. It is shown that peak values of EQE reaches up to 65% and the spectra cover a broad region from 300 to 850 nm for both CS-IV- and CS-V-based devices. JSC values integrated from the EQE data are 14.51 and 13.89 mA cm−2, respectively, which are within 5% mismatch with that obtained from J-V measurements. The EQE values and response regions are higher and wider compared to the bulky side chain substituted porphyrin molecules, and the inventors suspect the alkyl side chains will elevate the steric hindrance and thus promote intermolecular interactions.
The EQE spectrum of CS-V-based devices showed a slightly broader response but with smaller EQE values from 600 to 750 nm than CS-IV, which is consistent with the absorption spectra of CS-IV and CS-V in pure and blend film. The EQE response for CS-V longer than 750 nm can be ascribed to its stronger J-aggregations and the EQE peak at around 700 nm from CS-IV-based devices was speculated to be H-aggregation features of the molecule. It is also noted that in EQE spectra, a broad peak from 300-600 nm region showed up, and this peak breadth is much wider than soret band of porphyrin molecules, the inventors thus conclude both PC71BM and porphyrin molecules contributed to the photon-to-electron conversions.
In the present invention, the inventors designed a dimeric porphyrin dye (CS-DP) based on an efficient push-pull zinc porphyrin (MP) with extended π-conjugation through coupling of two zinc porphine cores via an acetylene bridge at the meso position of the porphyrin to extend the absorption spectrum effectively into the near infrared region. FIG. 8A shows molecular structure of MP and FIG. 8B shows molecular structure of CS-DP. As shown in FIG. 12B, the device based on CS-DP/PC71BM showed panchromatic spectral features in the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) action spectrum in the region 300-950 nm, and the devices displayed power conversion efficiencies as high as 8.23% with JSC/mA cm−2=15.14, VOC/mV=0.78 and FF=69.8% (FIGS. 12A-12B) under AM 1.5G solar irradiation. This performance is superior to what is obtained from the individual near-infrared small molecule based single-layer devices systems.

The synthetic route for the porphyrin is shown in Scheme 3. It should be noted that the use of zinc as the central metal atom is necessary for high stability. The Sonogashira coupling of PZnBr with arylacetylenes produced the monobrominated intermediates. The important asymmetry intermediates was obtained in good yield by same coupling of monobrominated intermediates and triisopropylacetylene in the presence of catalytic amounts of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) dichloride [PdCl2(PPh3)2] in quantitative yields. In order to get higher yield, the target small molecule CS-DP was obtained by one step that combined deprotection reaction with sonogashira coupling. The targeted molecules CS-DP were prepared by the Knoevenagel condensation of 3-ethylrhodanine with c respectively. Detailed synthetic procedures are described in the experimental section. They are well soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, THF, and toluene, and can be readily processed to form smooth and pinhole-free films upon spin-coating
Optical and Electrochemical Properties
The inventors evaluated the optical properties of MP and CS-DP by using UV-Vis absorption spectroscopies. The absorption spectra of MP and CS-DP in CHCl3 and in film are shown in FIG. 9-11, and data are collected in Table 4. The absorption spectrum of MP in dilute solution showing exhibits an intensive absorption band at 472 nm, 502 nm and 696 nm with a high molar extinction coefficient of 1.64×10−5 cm−1, 1.95×10−5 cm−1 and 1.81×10−5 cm−1, respective (FIG. 10). As expected, the maximum absorption CS-DP was much more red-shifted to 791 nm in comparison to monomer analogue MP, indicating the lower band gap of CS-DP due to the strong electron coupling and electronic delocalization of dimeric porphyrin core tethered by ethynyl linkers (FIG. 9). Compared to its spectrum in solution, the thin film of CS-DP exhibits a significantly broadened and bathochromic absorption with Q band extended into NIR region over 1100 nm (FIG. 9). Impressively, CS-DP with the A-π2-D-π1-Dπ2-A configuration shows a red-shifted Q-band by 117 nm in thin film contrasted sharply with the A-π-D-π-A structural MP, The result indicates that the dimeric porphyrin center is more favorable in self-assembly, leading to strong intermolecular π-π interactions. The absorption spectrum of CS-DP/PC71BM (w/w, 4:5) was also evaluated in FIG. 11. In BHJ thin film, the absorption in the range of 400 to 600 nm is enhanced due to the inclusion of PCBM with strong absorption in the visible region. In addition, the BHJ thin films prepared under different processing conditions show different absorption features Q band region, which is strongly correlated with the morphology of BHJ thin films.

Photovoltaics Performance
The solution-processed BHJ OSCs were fabricated utilizing CS-DP as the electron donor and PC71BM as the electron acceptor under a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CS-DP:PC71BM/Ca/Al, and the device performance was measured under a simulated solar illumination of 100 mW/cm2. The current density-voltage (J-V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are shown in FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B, and the photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 5. The CS-DP/PC71BM mass ratios ranging from 1:1 to 1:1.5 were first investigated, and the ratio of the CS-DP/PC71BM was optimized to be 4:5 with pyridine as additive in chlorobenzene solution. Except for the initial thermal annealing (TA), tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatment was further processed for the film and best vapor annealing time was found to be 20 s. Although CS-DP has a high lying HOMO energy level of −4.96 eV and a small band gap of −1.26 eV, all devices demonstrated high open circuit voltages (VOC) in a range of 0.75 to 0.83 V. The energy losses were calculated in-between 0.43-0.51 eV, which are among the smallest values for systems with a high EQE. As ultra-small bandgap donor materials usually process low VOC values, it is great potential to exactly balance the bandgap with the low energy losses and overall performance through finely structural engineering of π-conjugation systems.

As solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and thermal annealing (TA) are effective treatments to optimize thin film morphology in the active layer, CS-DP based devices also showed dramatically improved PCEs in comparison with those of as-cast devices after two step annealing (TA-SVA) treatments (FIG. 12A). In detail, as-cast devices gave an average PCE 1.05%, with a VOC of 0.827 V, a JSC of 3.84 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 33.1%. Using pyridine as an additive and then thermal annealing at 90° C. for 5 min, the PCE value increased to 3.35%, with a VOC=0.835 V, a JSC=950 mA cm−2, and an FF=42.2%. And the PCE of the device was further enhanced to 5.86% after SVA of the active layer with THF, corresponding to a JSC=12.61 mA cm−2 and an FF=56.3%.35 Since a combined TA and SVA method can effectively enhance performances, it is worthy to note that proper thermal annealing treatment (110° C.) can provide the highest PCE for CS-DP with 20 s THF vapor annealing. Under 110° C. thermal annealing, the device showed a JSC to 15.14 mA cm−2, a FF of 69.8%, a VOC to 0.781 V and a PCE of 8.23%. However, 130° C. thermal annealing led to a decreased 7.69% PCE with a VOC=0.765 V, a JSC=14.75 mA cm−2 and a FF=68.2%; 150° C. thermal annealing led to a further decreased PCE of 6.45%, with a VOC of 0.756 V, a JSC of 14.20 mA cm−3, a fill factor of 60.1%, mainly due to an obvious reduction in JSC.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured to explore the spectral response of the optimized devices. The results are shown in FIG. 12B, which is matched well with J-V measurements. It is clear that the CS-DP based devices can convert photons into electrons efficiently in the wavelength region of 300-900 nm, and a lower EQE tail extended to 950 nm, well inside NIR region. The three prominent peaks around 350, 500 and 800 nm, corresponding to PC71BM, Soret band and Q band absorption features. The relationship between photocurrent (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) was also examined (FIG. 13). The Jph value reaches the saturation value (Jph,sat) at high effective voltage. Theoretically, the Jph,sat was correlated to the maximum exciton generation rate after photons being absorbed. The OPV cell with TA treatment showed a higher Jph,sat compared to pristine device, indicating that more photons could be absorbed, corresponding to the optimized morphology. In addition, the charge collection probabilities P(E,T), which can be assessed by the Jph/Jph,sat ratios under short circuit conditions, are 51.9% and 87.5% for the pristine device and the device with additive and TA treatment, indicating improved charge collection efficiency. Device processed by using only pyridine additive without TA showed a reduced Jph-voltage relationship in the carrier-drifting region. This is because the transport of carriers is quite unbalanced and the build-up of space charges strongly limits photon current, thus the correlated device fill factor is low.
