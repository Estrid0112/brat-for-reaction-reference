TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to compounds, materials for organic electroluminescence device comprising the compounds, organic electroluminescence devices comprising the compounds, and electronic devices comprising the organic electroluminescence devices.
BACKGROUND ART
An organic electroluminescence device (also referred to as “organic EL device”) is generally composed of an anode, a cathode, and one or more organic thin film layers which comprise a light emitting layer and are sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. When a voltage is applied between the electrodes, electrons are injected from the cathode and holes are injected from the anode into a light emitting region. The injected electrons recombine with the injected holes in the light emitting region to form excited states. When the excited states return to the ground state, the energy is released as light. Therefore, it is important for increasing the efficiency of an organic EL device to develop a compound which transports electrons or holes into the light emitting region efficiently and facilitates the recombination of electrons and holes. Therefore, a host material to be used in the light emitting layer have been still continuously sought.
In addition, a charge transporting material having a high electron and/or hole mobility and a charge transporting material having an ionization potential level and/or a affinity level (electron affinity) balanced with the energy level of light emitting layer are required for improving the light emission efficiency and the device lifetime. Therefore, various proposals have been made for such a charge transporting material.

A composite material obtained by mixing an organic compound and an electron donor is also usable in the electron injecting layer.

Examples of the material for the cathode include a metal of the group 1 or 2 of the periodic table, for example, an alkali metal, such as lithium (Li) and cesium (Cs), an alkaline earth metal, such as magnesium (Mg), an alloy containing these metals (for example, MgAg and AlLi), a rare earth metal, such as europium (Eu) and ytterbium (Yb), and an alloy containing a rare earth metal.
The alkali metal, the alkaline earth metal, and the alloy thereof can be made into the cathode by a vacuum vapor deposition or a sputtering method. When a silver paste, etc. is used, a coating method and an inkjet method are usable.
When the electron injecting layer is formed, the material for the cathode can be selected independently from the work function and various electroconductive materials, such as Al, Ag, ITO, graphene, and indium oxide-tin oxide doped with silicon or silicon oxide, are usable. These electroconductive materials are made into films by a sputtering method, an inkjet method, and a spin coating method.
Each layer of the organic EL device is formed by a dry film-forming method, such as vacuum vapor deposition, sputtering, plasma, and ion plating, and a wet film-forming method, such as spin coating, dip coating, and flow coating.
In the wet film-forming method, the material for each layer is dissolved or dispersed in a suitable solvent, such as ethanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane, and then the obtained solution or dispersion is made into a film. To improve the film-forming properties and prevent pin holes on the film, the solution and the dispersion may include a resin or an additive. Examples of the resin include an insulating resin and a copolymer thereof, such as polystyrene, polycarbonate, polyarylate, polyester, polyamide, polyurethane, polysulfone, polymethyl methacrylate, polymethyl acrylate, and cellulose; and a photoconductive resin, such as poly-N-vinylcarbazole and polysilane; and an electroconductive resin, such as polythiophene and polypyrrole. Examples of the additive include an antioxidant, an ultraviolet absorber, and a plasticizer.
The thickness of each layer is not particularly limited and selected so as to obtain a good device performance. If extremely thick, a large applied voltage is needed to obtain a desired emission output, thereby reducing the efficiency. If extremely thin, pinholes occur on the film to make it difficult to obtain a sufficient luminance even when applying an electric field. The thickness is generally 5 nm to 10 μm and preferably 10 nm to 0.2 μm. The thickness of the light emitting layer is, but not particularly limited to, preferably 5 to 100 nm, more preferably 7 to 70 nm, and still more preferably 10 to 50 nm. The thickness of the hole transporting layer is preferably 10 to 300 nm.
When the hole transporting layer is made into a two-layered structure as described above, the thickness of the first hole transporting layer (anode side) is preferably 50 to 300 nm, more preferably 50 to 250 nm, still more preferably 50 to 200 nm, and further preferably 50 to 150 nm, and the thickness of the second hole transporting layer (light emitting layer side) is preferably 5 to 100 nm, more preferably 5 to 80 nm, and if needed, 5 to 40 nm, preferably 5 to 20 nm.

Example 1-1 (Production of Organic EL Device)
A glass substrate of 25 mm×75 mm×1.1 mm having an ITO transparent electrode (product of Geomatec Company) was cleaned by ultrasonic cleaning in isopropyl alcohol for 5 min and then UV (ultraviolet) ozone cleaning for 30 min.
The cleaned glass substrate having a transparent electrode line was mounted to a substrate holder of a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus. First, the electron-accepting compound (A1) was vapor-deposited on the surface having the transparent electrode line so as to cover the transparent electrode to form an acceptor layer with a thickness of 5 nm.
On the acceptor layer, the aromatic amine derivative (X1) as a first hole transporting material was vapor-deposited to form a first hole transporting layer with a thickness of 85 nm. Successively after forming the first hole transporting layer, the aromatic amine derivative (Y1) as a second hole transporting material was vapor-deposited to form a second hole transporting layer with a thickness of 10 nm.
On the hole transporting layer, the compound (PH1) as a phosphorescent host material and Ir(ppy)3 as a phosphorescent dopant were vapor co-deposited into a thickness of 30 nm to form a phosphorescent emitting layer. The concentration of Ir(ppy)3 was 15% by mass.
Thereafter, on the light emitting layer, the benzimidazole derivative (ET1) was vapor-deposited into a thickness of 30 nm and LiF was vapor-deposited into a thickness of 1 nm to form an electron transporting/injecting layer. Further, metallic Al was deposited into a thickness of 80 nm to form a cathode, thereby producing an organic EL device.
Evaluation of Emission Performance of Organic EL Device
The organic EL device thus produced was allowed to emit light by driving at a constant current and measured for the luminance (L) and the current density. From the measured results, the current efficiency (L/J) and the driving voltage (V) at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 were determined. In addition, the lifetime (80% lifetime) at a current density of 50 mA/cm2 was determined. The 80% lifetime is the time taken until the luminance is reduced to 80% of the initial luminance when driving at a constant current. The results are shown in Table 1.
