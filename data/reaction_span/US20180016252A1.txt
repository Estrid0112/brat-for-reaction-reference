FIELD OF THE INVENTION
Described herein are compounds that are somatostatin modulators, methods of making such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions and medicaments comprising such compounds, and methods of using such compounds in the treatment of conditions, diseases, or disorders that would benefit from modulating somatostatin activity.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Somatostatin is a peptide hormone that regulates the endocrine system and affects neurotransmission and cell proliferation via interaction with G-protein-coupled somatostatin receptors and inhibition of the release of numerous secondary hormones. Six subtype somatostatin receptor proteins have been identified (SSTR1, SSTR2a, SSTR2b, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5) and are encoded by five different somatostatin receptor genes. Modulation of a particular subtype somatostatin receptor, or combination thereof, is attractive for the treatment of conditions, diseases, or disorders that would benefit from modulating somatostatin activity.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Compounds described herein are somatostatin modulator compounds. In some embodiments, compounds described herein modulate one or more of the subtype somatostatin receptor proteins. In some embodiments, compounds described herein modulate two or more of the subtype somatostatin receptor proteins. Somatostatin peptide analogs, such as octreotide and pasireotide, formulated as depot injections, are routinely used to normalize hormone levels for the treatment of GH secreting adenomas, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and carcinoid tumors. Unfortunately, these analogs are only effective in about half of acromegalic patients with GH adenomas, and patients with carcinoid tumors frequently become resistant to therapy due to internalization and desensitization of the SST2A receptor. In addition, these peptide drugs are extremely expensive and require frequent doctor's office visits for painful injections that can lead to injection site reactions. Compounds described herein are molecules that are structurally different from peptide analogs. The compounds described herein are somatostatin modulators that are potent inhibitors of hormone secretion.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Somatostatin (SST), also known as somatotropin release inhibiting factor (SRIF) was initially isolated as a 14-amino acid peptide from ovine hypothalamii (Brazeau et al., Science 179, 77-79, 1973). An N-terminal extended 28-amino acid peptide with similar biological activity to 14-amino acid somatostatin was subsequently isolated (Pradayrol et, al., FEBS Letters, 109, 55-58, 1980; Esch et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77, 6827-6831, 1980). SST is a regulatory peptide produced by several cell types in response to other neuropeptides, neurotransmitters, hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. SST acts through both endocrine and paracrine pathways to affect its target cells. Many of these effects are related to the inhibition of secretion of other hormones, most notably growth hormone (GH). They are produced by a wide variety of cell types in the central nervous sstem (CNS) and gut and have multiple functions including modulation of secretion of growth hormone (GH), insulin, glucagon, as well as many other hormones that are anti-proliferative.
These pleotropic actions of somatostatins are mediated by six somatostatin receptor proteins (SSTR1, SSTR2a, SSTR2b, SSTR3, SSTR4, SSTR5). The six somatostatin receptor proteins are encoded by five different somatostatin receptor genes (Reisine and Bell, Endocr Rev. 16, 427-442, 1995; Patel and Srikant, Trends Endocrinol Metab 8, 398-405, 1997). All the receptors are members of the class-A subgroup of the GPCR superfamily. SST2A receptor is the most widely expressed subtype in human tumors and is the dominant receptor by which GH secretion is suppressed. Unless otherwise stated, the term SSTR2 means SSTR2a.
It is possible to selectively modulate any one of the somatostatin receptor subtypes, or combination thereof. In some embodiments, selectively modulating any one of the somatostatin receptor subtypes relative to the other somatostatin receptor subtypes, or combination thereof, in useful in a variety of clinical applications. In some embodiments, selectively modulating any one of the somatostatin receptor subtypes relative to the other somatostatin receptor subtypes reduces unwanted side effects in a variety of clinical applications.
For example, modulation of SSTR2 activity mediates the inhibition of growth hormone (GH) release from the anterior pituitary and glucagon release from pancreas. SSTR2 is also implicated in many other biological functions such as, but not limited to, cell proliferation, nociception, inflammation, and angiogenesis. In some embodiments, a selective SSTR2 modulator is used in the treatment of acromegaly, gut neuroendocrine tumors, pain, neuropathies, nephropathies, and inflammation, as well as retinopathies resulting from aberrant blood vessel growth. In some other embodiments, a selective SSTR2 modulator is used in the treatment of arthritis, pain, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, Cushing's disease, acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and ophthalmic disorders such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, and Graves ophthalmology, among others.
In some embodiments, SSTR4 agonists exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects.
In some embodiments, SSTR3 agonists inhibit insulin secretion.
In some embodiments, SSTR5 agonists inhibit insulin secretion. In addition, SSTR5 has also been implicated to modulate the release of growth hormone.
Somatostatin peptide and its receptor subtypes are also widely expressed in the brain and disruption or diminishment of their activity is potentially involved in several psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. For example, concentrations of somatostatin in the cebrebral cortex and hippocampus are reduced in schizophrenics and one of the most consistent neuropathologic findings in this patient group is a deficit in cortical inhibitory interneurons expressing somatostatin. Somatostatin is also highly expressed in brain regions associated with seizures and has also been implicated as having an important role in epilepsy. Somatostatin levels are diminshed in the hippocampi of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's patients, suggesting that restoration of its signaling as a potential drug target for neurodegeneration.
In one aspect, compounds described herein are modulators of SSTR2. In some embodiments, compounds described herein selectively modulate the activity of SSTR2 relative to the other somatostatin receptors.
In some embodiments, compounds described here are amenable to oral administration to a mammal in need of treatment with a somatostatin modulator.
In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein have utility over a wide range of therapeutic applications. In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein are used in the treatment of a variety of diseases or conditions such as, but not limited to acromegaly, neuroendocrine tumors, retinopathies and other ophthalmic disorders, neuropathy, nephropathy, respiratory diseases, cancers, pain, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammatory diseases, as well as psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein are used in the treatment of acromegaly in a mammal.
In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein inhibit the secretion of various hormones and trophic factors in mammals. In some embodiments, the compounds are used to suppress certain endocrine secretions, such as, but not limited to GH, insulin, glucagon and prolactin. The suppression of certain endocrine secretions is useful in the treatment of disorders such as acromegaly; endocrine tumors such as carcinoids, VIPomas, insulinomas and glucagonomas; or diabetes and diabetes-related pathologies, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein are used to suppress exocrine secretions in the pancreas, stomach and intestines, for the treatment of disorders such as pancreatitis, fistulas, bleeding ulcers and diarrhea associated with such diseases as AIDS or cholera. Disorders involving autocrine or paracrine secretions of trophic factors such as IGF-1 (as well as some endocrine factors) which may be treated by administration of the compounds described herein include cancers of the breast, prostate, and lung (both small cell and non-small cell epidermoids), as well as hepatomas, neuroblastomas, colon and pancreatic adenocarcinomas (ductal type), chondrosarcomas, and melanomas, diabetic retinopathy, and atherosclerosis associated with vascular grafts and restenosis following angioplasty.
In some embodiments, somatostatin receptor modulators described herein are used to suppress the mediators of neurogenic inflammation (e.g. substance P or the tachykinins), and may be used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis; psoriasis; topical inflammation such as is associated with sunburn, eczema, or other sources of itching; inflammatory bowel disease; irritable bowel syndrome; allergies, including asthma and other respiratory diseases In some other embodiments, the somatostatin receptor modulators described herein function as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and are useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, pain, and headaches.

In some embodiments, provided herein is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound that is described in Table 4.
In one aspect, compounds described herein are in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As well, active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity are included in the scope of the present disclosure. In addition, the compounds described herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. The solvated forms of the compounds presented herein are also considered to be disclosed herein.
“Pharmaceutically acceptable,” as used herein, refers a material, such as a carrier or diluent, which does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic, i.e., the material is administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the components of the composition in which it is contained.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a form of a therapeutically active agent that consists of a cationic form of the therapeutically active agent in combination with a suitable anion, or in alternative embodiments, an anionic form of the therapeutically active agent in combination with a suitable cation. Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use. International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, Wiley-VCH 2002. S. M. Berge, L. D. Bighley, D. C. Monkhouse, J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19. P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, editors, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, Weinheim/Zurich:Wiley-VCH/VHCA, 2002. Pharmaceutical salts typically are more soluble and more rapidly soluble in stomach and intestinal juices than non-ionic species and so are useful in solid dosage forms. Furthermore, because their solubility often is a function of pH, selective dissolution in one or another part of the digestive tract is possible and this capability can be manipulated as one aspect of delayed and sustained release behaviours. Also, because the salt-forming molecule can be in equilibrium with a neutral form, passage through biological membranes can be adjusted.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained by reacting a compound of Formula (I) with an acid. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) (i.e. free base form) is basic and is reacted with an organic acid or an inorganic acid. Inorganic acids include, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, and metaphosphoric acid. Organic acids include, but are not limited to, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid; 2,2-dichloroacetic acid; 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid; 2-oxoglutaric acid; 4-acetamidobenzoic acid; 4-aminosalicylic acid; acetic acid; adipic acid; ascorbic acid (L); aspartic acid (L); benzenesulfonic acid; benzoic acid; camphoric acid (+); camphor-10-sulfonic acid (+); capric acid (decanoic acid); caproic acid (hexanoic acid); caprylic acid (octanoic acid); carbonic acid; cinnamic acid; citric acid; cyclamic acid; dodecylsulfuric acid; ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid; ethanesulfonic acid; formic acid; fumaric acid; galactaric acid; gentisic acid; glucoheptonic acid (D); gluconic acid (D); glucuronic acid (D); glutamic acid; glutaric acid; glycerophosphoric acid; glycolic acid; hippuric acid; isobutyric acid; lactic acid (DL); lactobionic acid; lauric acid; maleic acid; malic acid (− L); malonic acid; mandelic acid (DL); methanesulfonic acid; naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid; naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid; nicotinic acid; oleic acid; oxalic acid; palmitic acid; pamoic acid; phosphoric acid; proprionic acid; pyroglutamic acid (− L); salicylic acid; sebacic acid; stearic acid; succinic acid; sulfuric acid; tartaric acid (+ L); thiocyanic acid; toluenesulfonic acid (p); and undecylenic acid.
In some embodiments, a compound of Formula (I) is prepared as a chloride salt, sulfate salt, bromide salt, mesylate salt, maleate salt, citrate salt or phosphate salt.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained by reacting a compound of Formula (I) with a base. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is acidic and is reacted with a base. In such situations, an acidic proton of the compound of Formula (I) is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, or an aluminum ion. In some cases, compounds described herein coordinate with an organic base, such as, but not limited to, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, meglumine, N-methylglucamine, dicyclohexylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine. In other cases, compounds described herein form salts with amino acids such as, but not limited to, arginine, lysine, and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases used to form salts with compounds that include an acidic proton, include, but are not limited to, aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, and the like. In some embodiments, the compounds provided herein are prepared as a sodium salt, calcium salt, potassium salt, magnesium salt, meglumine salt, N-methylglucamine salt or ammonium salt.
It should be understood that a reference to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms. In some embodiments, solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are formed during the process of crystallization with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Solvates of compounds described herein are conveniently prepared or formed during the processes described herein. In addition, the compounds provided herein optionally exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms.
The methods and formulations described herein include the use of N-oxides (if appropriate), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds having the structure of Formula (I), as well as active metabolites of these compounds having the same type of activity.
In some embodiments, sites on the organic radicals (e.g. alkyl groups, aromatic rings) of compounds of Formula (I) are susceptible to various metabolic reactions. Incorporation of appropriate substituents on the organic radicals will reduce, minimize or eliminate this metabolic pathway. In specific embodiments, the appropriate substituent to decrease or eliminate the susceptibility of the aromatic ring to metabolic reactions is, by way of example only, a halogen, deuterium, an alkyl group, a haloalkyl group, or a deuteroalkyl group.
In another embodiment, the compounds described herein are labeled isotopically (e.g. with a radioisotope) or by another other means, including, but not limited to, the use of chromophores or fluorescent moieties, bioluminescent labels, or chemiluminescent labels.
Compounds described herein include isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in the various formulae and structures presented herein, but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the present compounds include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, fluorine chlorine, iodine, phosphorus, such as, for example, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I, 124I, 125I, 131I, 32P and 33P. In one aspect, isotopically-labeled compounds described herein, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. In one aspect, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, such as, for example, increased in vivo half-life or altered metabolic pathways to reduce undesirable metabolites or reduced dosage requirements.
In some embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I) possess one or more stereocenters and each stereocenter exists independently in either the R or S configuration. For example, in some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the R configuration when one stereocenter is present. In other embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the S configuration when one stereocenter is present. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the RR configuration when two stereocenters are present. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the RS configuration when two stereocenters are present. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the SS configuration when two stereocenters are present. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) exists in the SR configuration when two stereocenters are present.
The compounds presented herein include all diastereomeric, individual enantiomers, atropisomers, and epimeric forms as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof. The compounds and methods provided herein include all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E), and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate mixtures thereof.
Individual stereoisomers are obtained, if desired, by methods such as, stereoselective synthesis and/or the separation of stereoisomers by chiral chromatographic columns or the separation of diastereomers by either non-chiral or chiral chromatographic columns or crystallization and recrystallization in a proper solvent or a mixture of solvents. In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) are prepared as their individual stereoisomers by reacting a racemic mixture of the compound with an optically active resolving agent to form a pair of diastereoisomeric compounds/salts, separating the diastereomers and recovering the optically pure individual enantiomers. In some embodiments, resolution of individual enantiomers of compounds of Formula (I) is carried out using covalent diastereomeric derivatives of the compounds described herein. In another embodiment, diastereomers of compounds of Formula (I) are separated by separation/resolution techniques based upon differences in solubility. In other embodiments, separation of steroisomers of compounds of Formula (I) is performed by chromatography or by the forming diastereomeric salts and separation by recrystallization, or chromatography, or any combination thereof. Jean Jacques, Andre Collet, Samuel H. Wilen, “Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions”, John Wiley And Sons, Inc., 1981. In some embodiments, stereoisomers are obtained by stereoselective synthesis.
Seaparation of individual enantiomers from a racemic mixture is possible by the use of chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) or chiral high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In some embodiments, enantiomers described herein are separated from each other by the use of chiral SFC or chrial HPLC. In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) that include one or more chiral centers (e.g. compounds of Formula (I) that include the moiety trans-octahydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]morpholin-6-yl) are separated into individual enantiomers using chiral SFC or chrial HPLC. A wide variety of conditions and suitiable columns are available.
Daicel polysaccharide chiral stationary phases (CSPs) are among the columns used for chiral SFC separations. In some embodiments, Daicel analytical immobilised and coated CHIRALPAK and CHIRALCEL HPLC columns can be used for SFC analysis.
In some embodiments, screening for the suitability of using a SFC column is performed on the four main immobilised phases (CHIRALPAK IA, IB, IC and ID) and the four main coated columns (CHIRALPAK AD and AS and CHIRALCEL OD and OJ), with varying concentrations of organic modifier. A variety of column phases are available, including but not limited to OD and OJ, OX and OZ chlorinated phases, and a range of complementary cellulose based CHIRALCEL phases including OA, OB, OC, OF, OG and OK.
Non-limiting examples of chiral selectors contemplated for use in the seaparation of enantiomers include amylose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), cellulose tris (3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate), cellulose tris (3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamate), amylose tris (3-chlorophenylcarbamate), amylose tris (3,5-dichlorophenylcarbamate), amylose tris (3-chloro, 4-methylphenylcarbamate), amylose tris ((S)-alpha-methylbenzylcarbamate), amylose tris (5-chloro-2-methylphenylcarbamate), cellulose tris (4-methylbenzoate), cellulose tris (4-chloro-3-methylphenylcarbamate), and cellulose tris (3-chloro-4-methylphenylcarbamate).
Non-limiting examples of chiral columns contemplated for use in the seaparation of enantiomers include CHIRALPAK IA SFC, CHIRALPAK AD-H SFC, CHIRALPAK D3 SFC, CHIRALCEL OD-H SFC, CHIRALPAK IC SFC, CHIRALPAK ID SFC, CHIRALPAK IE SFC, CHIRALPAK IF SFC, CHIRALPAK AZ-H SFC, CHIRALPAK AS-H SFC, CHIRALPAK AY-H SFC, CHIRALCEL OJ-H SFC, CHIRALCEL OX-H SFC, and CHIRALCEL OZ-H SFC.
In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as prodrugs. A “prodrug” refers to an agent that is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they are easier to administer than the parent drug. They are, for instance, bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent is not. Further or alternatively, the prodrug also has improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. In some embodiments, the design of a prodrug increases the effective water solubility. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug is a compound described herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to provide the active entity. A further example of a prodrug is a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized to reveal the active moiety. In certain embodiments, upon in vivo administration, a prodrug is chemically converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound. In certain embodiments, a prodrug is enzymatically metabolized by one or more steps or processes to the biologically, pharmaceutically or therapeutically active form of the compound.
Prodrugs of the compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, esters, ethers, carbonates, thiocarbonates, N-acyl derivatives, N-acyloxyalkyl derivatives, N-alkyloxyacyl derivatives, quaternary derivatives of tertiary amines, N-Mannich bases, Schiff bases, amino acid conjugates, phosphate esters, and sulfonate esters. See for example Design of Prodrugs, Bundgaard, A. Ed., Elseview, 1985 and Method in Enzymology, Widder, K. et al., Ed.; Academic, 1985, vol. 42, p. 309-396; Bundgaard, H. “Design and Application of Prodrugs” in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Krosgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, Ed., 1991, Chapter 5, p. 113-191; and Bundgaard, H., Advanced Drug Delivery Review, 1992, 8, 1-38, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, a hydroxyl group in the compounds disclosed herein is used to form a prodrug, wherein the hydroxyl group is incorporated into an acyloxyalkyl ester, alkoxycarbonyloxyalkyl ester, alkyl ester, aryl ester, phosphate ester, sugar ester, ether, and the like. In some embodiments, a hydroxyl group in the compounds disclosed herein is a prodrug wherein the hydroxyl is then metabolized in vivo to provide a carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, a carboxyl group is used to provide an ester or amide (i.e. the prodrug), which is then metabolized in vivo to provide a carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, compounds described herein are prepared as alkyl ester prodrugs.
Prodrug forms of the herein described compounds, wherein the prodrug is metabolized in vivo to produce a compound of Formula (I) as set forth herein are included within the scope of the claims. In some cases, some of the herein-described compounds is a prodrug for another derivative or active compound.
In some embodiments, any one of the hydroxyl group(s), amino group(s) and/or carboxylic acid group(s) are functionalized in a suitable manner to provide a prodrug moiety. In some embodiments, the prodrug moiety is as described above.
In some embodiments, the identity of and placement of substituents on the compounds described herein help to minimize undesired activity. For example, in some embodiments undesired activity includes undesired hERG inhibition. In some embodiments, the presence of a hydroxyl group and an adjacent cyano group on an aromatic ring reduces undesired hERG inhibition significantly as compared to the lack of both groups, the presence of a hydroxyl group without an adjacent cyano group, or the presence of a cyano group without an adjacent hydroxyl group. For example, in some embodiments significant reduction of undesired hERG inhibition is observed when RB is a substituted or unsubstituted 2-hydroxy-3-cyanophenyl.
In additional or further embodiments, the compounds described herein are metabolized upon administration to an organism in need to produce a metabolite that is then used to produce a desired effect, including a desired therapeutic effect.
A “metabolite” of a compound disclosed herein is a derivative of that compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “active metabolite” refers to a biologically active derivative of a compound that is formed when the compound is metabolized. The term “metabolized,” as used herein, refers to the sum of the processes (including, but not limited to, hydrolysis reactions and reactions catalyzed by enzymes) by which a particular substance is changed by an organism. Thus, enzymes may produce specific structural alterations to a compound. For example, cytochrome P450 catalyzes a variety of oxidative and reductive reactions while uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferases catalyze the transfer of an activated glucuronic-acid molecule to aromatic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines and free sulphydryl groups. Metabolites of the compounds disclosed herein are optionally identified either by administration of compounds to a host and analysis of tissue samples from the host, or by incubation of compounds with hepatic cells in vitro and analysis of the resulting compounds.

If it is necessary, R2 substitution can be introduced at XIII where R2 is a hydrogen, XIII can react with R2X (X═Br, I, OMs, OTf) under strong base such as NaH. If it is necessary, R2 substitution can also be introduced on XIV where R2 is hydrogen.

(Lippincott Williams & Wilkins 1999), herein incorporated by reference for such disclosure.
In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are administered either alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients or diluents, in a pharmaceutical composition. Administration of the compounds and compositions described herein can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include, though are not limited to delivery via enteral routes (including oral, gastric or duodenal feeding tube, rectal suppository and rectal enema), parenteral routes (injection or infusion, including intraarterial, intracardiac, intradermal, intraduodenal, intramedullary, intramuscular, intraosseous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intravascular, intravenous, intravitreal, epidural and subcutaneous), inhalational, transdermal, transmucosal, sublingual, buccal and topical (including epicutaneous, dermal, enema, eye drops, ear drops, intranasal, vaginal) administration, although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. By way of example only, compounds described herein can be administered locally to the area in need of treatment, by for example, local infusion during surgery, topical application such as creams or ointments, injection, catheter, or implant. The administration can also be by direct injection at the site of a diseased tissue or organ.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration are presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. In some embodiments, the active ingredient is presented as a bolus, electuary or paste.
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. In some embodiments, the tablets are coated or scored and are formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In some embodiments, stabilizers are added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or Dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutical compositions are formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.
Pharmaceutical compositions may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt.
For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth.
Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound of the present invention externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration.
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient may comprise, for topical administration, from 0.001% to 10% w/w, for instance from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation.

In one embodiment, the compounds of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are used in the preparation of medicaments for the treatment of diseases or conditions in a mammal that would benefit from modulation of somatostatin activity. Methods for treating any of the diseases or conditions described herein in a mammal in need of such treatment, involves administration of pharmaceutical compositions that include at least one compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, active metabolite, prodrug, or pharmaceutically acceptable solvate thereof, in therapeutically effective amounts to said mammal.
In certain embodiments, the compositions containing the compound(s) described herein are administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In certain therapeutic applications, the compositions are administered to a patient already suffering from a disease or condition, in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest at least one of the symptoms of the disease or condition. Amounts effective for this use depend on the severity and course of the disease or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status, weight, and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Therapeutically effective amounts are optionally determined by methods including, but not limited to, a dose escalation and/or dose ranging clinical trial.
In prophylactic applications, compositions containing the compounds described herein are administered to a patient susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a particular disease, disorder or condition. Such an amount is defined to be a “prophylactically effective amount or dose.” In this use, the precise amounts also depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. When used in patients, effective amounts for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. In one aspect, prophylactic treatments include administering to a mammal, who previously experienced at least one symptom of the disease being treated and is currently in remission, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in order to prevent a return of the symptoms of the disease or condition.
In certain embodiments wherein the patient's condition does not improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds are administered chronically, that is, for an extended period of time, including throughout the duration of the patient's life in order to ameliorate or otherwise control or limit the symptoms of the patient's disease or condition.
Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, in specific embodiments, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, is reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. In certain embodiments, however, the patient requires intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.
The amount of a given agent that corresponds to such an amount varies depending upon factors such as the particular compound, disease condition and its severity, the identity (e.g., weight, sex) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but nevertheless is determined according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, the condition being treated, and the subject or host being treated.
In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment are typically in the range of 0.01 mg-2000 mg per day. In one embodiment, the desired dose is conveniently presented in a single dose or in divided doses administered simultaneously or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.
In one embodiment, the daily dosages appropriate for the compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, described herein are from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg per body weight. In some embodiments, the daily dosage or the amount of active in the dosage form are lower or higher than the ranges indicated herein, based on a number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime. In various embodiments, the daily and unit dosages are altered depending on a number of variables including, but not limited to, the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens are determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 and the ED50. The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it is expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. In certain embodiments, the data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies are used in formulating the therapeutically effective daily dosage range and/or the therapeutically effective unit dosage amount for use in mammals, including humans. In some embodiments, the daily dosage amount of the compounds described herein lies within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. In certain embodiments, the daily dosage range and/or the unit dosage amount varies within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.
In any of the aforementioned aspects are further embodiments in which the effective amount of the compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is: (a) systemically administered to the mammal; and/or (b) administered orally to the mammal; and/or (c) intravenously administered to the mammal; and/or (d) administered by injection to the mammal; and/or (e) administered topically to the mammal; and/or (f) administered non-systemically or locally to the mammal.
In any of the aforementioned aspects are further embodiments comprising single administrations of the effective amount of the compound, including further embodiments in which (i) the compound is administered once a day; or (ii) the compound is administered to the mammal multiple times over the span of one day.
In any of the aforementioned aspects are further embodiments comprising multiple administrations of the effective amount of the compound, including further embodiments in which (i) the compound is administered continuously or intermittently: as in a single dose; (ii) the time between multiple administrations is every 6 hours; (iii) the compound is administered to the mammal every 8 hours; (iv) the compound is administered to the mammal every 12 hours; (v) the compound is administered to the mammal every 24 hours. In further or alternative embodiments, the method comprises a drug holiday, wherein the administration of the compound is temporarily suspended or the dose of the compound being administered is temporarily reduced; at the end of the drug holiday, dosing of the compound is resumed. In one embodiment, the length of the drug holiday varies from 2 days to 1 year.
Combination Treatments
In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer at least one compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents.
In one embodiment, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein is enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant has minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, in some embodiments, the benefit experienced by a patient is increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit.
In one specific embodiment, a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is co-administered with a second therapeutic agent, wherein the compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the second therapeutic agent modulate different aspects of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, thereby providing a greater overall benefit than administration of either therapeutic agent alone.
In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient is simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient experiences a synergistic benefit.
For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth. In additional embodiments, when co-administered with one or more other therapeutic agents, the compound provided herein is administered either simultaneously with the one or more other therapeutic agents, or sequentially.
In combination therapies, the multiple therapeutic agents (one of which is one of the compounds described herein) are administered in any order or even simultaneously. If administration is simultaneous, the multiple therapeutic agents are, by way of example only, provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (e.g., as a single pill or as two separate pills).
The compounds of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as well as combination therapies, are administered before, during or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the timing of administering the composition containing a compound varies. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds described herein are used as a prophylactic and are administered continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop conditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the disease or condition. In another embodiment, the compounds and compositions are administered to a subject during or as soon as possible after the onset of the symptoms. In specific embodiments, a compound described herein is administered as soon as is practicable after the onset of a disease or condition is detected or suspected, and for a length of time necessary for the treatment of the disease. In some embodiments, the length required for treatment varies, and the treatment length is adjusted to suit the specific needs of each subject.

SSTR Assays
Functional Assay for SSTR2 Agonists
General overview: All five SSTR subtypes are Gi coupled G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that lead to decreases in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) when activated by an agonist. Therefore, measurement of intracellular cAMP levels can be used to assess whether compounds of the invention are agonists of SSTR subtypes (John Kelly, Troy Stevens, W. Joseph Thompson, and Roland Seifert, Current Protocols in Pharmacology, 2005,2.2.1-2.2). Human SSTR2 intracellular cAMP assay is described below. The human SSTR1, 3, 4 and 5 assays follow the same protocol of SSTR2.
cAMP Assay Protocol:
Four days prior to the assay, 5,000 Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC #CCL-61) stably expressing the human SSTR2 are plated in each well of a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate in Ham's F12 growth media (ThermoFisher #10-080-CM) supplemented with 10% donor bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products #100-506), 100 U/mL penicillin; 100 ug/mL streptomycin; 2 mM L-glutamine (Gemini Bio-Products #400-110) and 0.2 mg/mL hygromycin B (GoldBio #31282-04-9). The cells are cultured at 37° C., 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. On the day of the assay, the media is aspirated and the cells are treated with 50 μL of 1.6 μM NKH477 (Sigma #N3290) plus various dilutions of compounds of the invention in assay buffer [1× Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (ThermoFisher #SH3058802), 0.5 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, VWR #200002-790)]. The cells are incubated for 20 minutes at 37° C. (the final concentration of the compounds of the invention are typically 0-10,000 nM). The cells are treated with 50 μL of lysis buffer (HRTF cAMP kit, Cisbio). The lysate is transferred to 384-well plates and cAMP detection and visualization antibodies are added and incubated for 1-24 hours at room temperature. The time-resolved fluorescent signal is read with a Tecan M1000Pro multiplate reader. The intracellular cAMP concentrations are calculated by regression to a standard curve and are plotted vs. the concentration of the compounds of the invention and the EC50 of the compounds are calculated using standard methods. All data manipulations are in GraphPad Prism v6.
Illustrative biological activity of compounds is demonstrated in the following table by evaluating the inhibition of cAMP activities via human SST2R, where A means <10 nM; B means ≧10 nM and <100 nM; C means ≧100 nM and <1000 nM; D means ≧1000 nM
