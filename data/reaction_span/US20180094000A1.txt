TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a polycyclic aromatic compound, a light emitting layer-forming composition using the same, and an organic electroluminescent element (organic EL element) manufactured using the composition. More specifically, the present invention relates to a light emitting layer-forming composition containing a polycyclic aromatic compound containing boron, nitrogen, or oxygen as a dopant, capable of wet film formation, and exhibiting excellent characteristics in a case of use as a constituent component of an organic EL element. In addition, the present invention relates to a polycyclic aromatic compound containing a functional group and boron, nitrogen, or oxygen.
BACKGROUND ART
An organic EL element can manufacture a display element and lighting which are driven by low power, are thin and light, and have excellent flexibility, and has been therefore actively studied as a next generation light emitting display element.
An organic EL element has a structure having a pair of electrodes composed of a positive electrode and a negative electrode, and a single layer or a plurality of layers which are disposed between the pair of electrodes and contain an organic compound. Examples of a layer containing an organic compound include a light emitting layer and a charge transport/injection layer for transporting or injecting a charge such as a hole or an electron. As a method for forming these organic layers, a vacuum deposition method or a wet film formation method is used.
The vacuum deposition method is advantageous in that a high-quality film can be formed uniformly on a substrate, a luminescent element which can be easily laminated and has excellent characteristics can be easily obtained, an extremely small amount of impurities derived from a manufacturing process are mixed, and the like. Many organic EL elements which are practically used now are obtained by the vacuum deposition method using a low molecular weight material. Meanwhile, a vacuum deposition apparatus used in the vacuum deposition method has such problems that the apparatus is generally expensive, continuous manufacturing is difficult, and manufacturing cost is high when all the steps are performed in vacuum.
On the other hand, the wet film formation method does not require a vacuum process, does not require an expensive vacuum deposition apparatus, and therefore makes it possible to form a layer at relatively low cost. In addition, the wet film formation method is advantageous in that an area can be large, continuous manufacturing is possible, a plurality of materials having various functions can be contained in one layer (coating liquid), and the like. Meanwhile, in the wet film formation method, lamination is difficult, and it is difficult to obtain a high-quality and uniform coating film which does not contain impurities derived from a manufacturing process (for example, a solvent).
In particular, development of an ink for forming a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, and a light emitting layer has been positively carried out for material development for a wet film formation method. Among these developments, regarding inks for a hole injection layer and a hole transport layer, characteristics of each layer formed by the wet film formation method using these inks have reached a practical level. Regarding an ink for forming a light emitting layer, development of inks for a red light-emitting layer and a green light-emitting layer is progressing toward improvement of characteristics. However, regarding an ink for a blue light-emitting layer, in general, development of a composition using a polycyclic aromatic compound having an aromatic ring, such as anthracene, a styryl derivative, or the like has been carried out, but has not obtained practical characteristics. In particular, at present, an ink for a blue light-emitting layer having high color purity has not been developed.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
1. Light Emitting Layer-Forming Composition
A blue light emitting layer-forming composition of the present invention is a composition for coating and forming a light emitting layer of an organic EL element. The composition includes at least one selected from the group consisting of a polycyclic aromatic compound represented by general formula (A) and a polycyclic aromatic multimer compound having a plurality of structures represented by general formula (A) as a first component; at least one selected from the group consisting of compounds represented by general formulas (B-1) to (B-6) as a second component; and at least one organic solvent as a third component. The first component functions as a dopant component of a light emitting layer obtained from the composition, and the second component functions as a host component of the light emitting layer. The third component functions as a solvent for dissolving the first component and the second component in the composition. At the time of application, the third component provides a smooth and uniform surface shape due to a controlled evaporation rate of the third component itself.
1-1. First Component: Compound Represented by General Formula (A) or (A')
The first component is at least one selected from the group consisting of a polycyclic aromatic compound represented by general formula (A) and a polycyclic aromatic multimer compound having a plurality of structures represented by general formula (A), and functions as a dopant component of a light emitting layer obtained from the light emitting layer-forming composition. A compound represented by general formula (A) has a high fluorescence quantum yield and high color purity, and is therefore preferable as a dopant of a light emitting layer. These compounds are preferably polycyclic aromatic compounds represented by general formula (A'), or polycyclic aromatic multimer compounds each having a plurality of structures represented by the following general formula (A').

Ring A, ring B and ring C in formula (A) each independently represent an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring, and at least one hydrogen atom in these rings may be substituted by a substituent. This substituent is preferably a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, a substituted or unsubstituted diarylamino, a substituted or unsubstituted diheteroarylamino, a substituted or unsubstituted arylheteroarylamino (an amino group having an aryl and a heteroaryl), a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted alkoxy, or a substituted or unsubstituted aryloxy. In a case where these groups have substituents, examples of the substituents include an aryl, a heteroaryl, and an alkyl. Furthermore, the aryl ring or heteroaryl ring preferably has a 5-membered ring or 6-membered ring that shares a bond with a fused bicyclic structure (hereinafter, this structure is also referred to as “structure D”) at the center of formula (A) constituted by Y1, X1 and X2.
Here, the “fused bicyclic structure (structure D)” means a structure in which two saturated hydrocarbon rings that are configured to include Y1, X1 and X2 and indicated at the center of formula (A), are fused. Furthermore, a “6-membered ring sharing a bond with the fused bicyclic structure” means, for example, ring a (benzene ring (6-membered ring)) fused to the structure D as represented by the above formula (A'). Furthermore, the phrase “aryl ring or heteroaryl ring (which is ring A) has this 6-membered ring” means that the ring A is formed from this 6-membered ring only, or the ring A is formed such that other rings are further fused to this 6-membered ring so as to include this 6-membered ring. In other words, the “aryl ring or heteroaryl ring (which is ring A) having a 6-membered ring” as used herein means that the 6-membered ring that constitutes the entirety or a portion of the ring A is fused to the structure D. Similar description applies to the “ring B (ring b)”, “ring C (ring c)”, and the “5-membered ring”.
The ring A (or ring B or ring C) in formula (A) corresponds to ring a and its substituents R1 to R3 in formula (A') (or ring b and its substituents R4 to R7, or ring c and its substituents R8 to R11). That is, formula (A') corresponds to a structure in which “rings A to C each having a 6-membered ring” have been selected as the rings A to C of formula (A). For this meaning, rings of formula (A') are represented by small letters a to c.
In formula (A'), adjacent groups among the substituents R1 to R11 of the ring a, ring b, and ring c may be bonded to each other to form an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c, and at least one hydrogen atom in the ring thus formed may be substituted by an aryl, a heteroaryl, a diarylamino, a diheteroarylamino, an arylheteroarylamino, an alkyl, an alkoxy, or an aryloxy, while at least one hydrogen atom in these may be substituted by an aryl, a heteroaryl or an alkyl. Therefore, a ring structure constituting the polycyclic aromatic compound represented by formula (A') changes according to a mutual bonding form of substituents in the ring a, ring b, and ring c as indicated by the following formulas (A'-1) and (A'-2). Ring A', ring B' and ring C' in each formula correspond to the ring A, ring B and ring C, respectively, in formula (A). Note that R1 to R3, Y1, X1, and X2 in formula (A'-1) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A'), and R4 to R11, Y1, X1, and X2 in formula (A'-2) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00025.TIF </img>
The ring A', ring B', and ring C' in the above formulas (A'-1) and (A'-2) each represent, to be described in connection with formula (A'), an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among the substituents R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, and ring c, respectively (may also be referred to as a fused ring obtained by fusing another ring structure to the ring a, ring b, or ring c). Incidentally, although not indicated in the formula, there is also a compound in which all of the ring a, ring b, and ring c have been changed to the ring A', ring B' and ring C'. Furthermore, as apparent from the above formulas (A'-1) and (A'-2), for example, R8 of the ring b and R7 of the ring c, R11 of the ring b and R1 of the ring a, R4 of the ring c and R3 of the ring a, and the like do not correspond to “adjacent groups”, and these groups are not bonded to each other. That is, the term “adjacent groups” means adjacent groups on the same ring.
A compound represented by the above formula (A'-1) or (A'-2) corresponds to, for example, a compound represented by any one of formulas (1-402) to (1-409) listed as specific compounds described below. That is, for example, the compound represented by formula (A'-1) or formula (A'-2) is a compound having ring A' (or ring B' or ring C') that is formed by fusing a benzene ring, an indole ring, a pyrrole ring, a benzofuran ring or a benzothiophene ring to the benzene ring which is the ring a (or ring b or ring c), and the fused ring A' (or fused ring B' or fused ring C') that has been formed is a naphthalene ring, a carbazole ring, an indole ring, a dibenzofuran ring, or a dibenzothiophene ring.
The “aryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” in formula (A') is, for example, an aryl ring having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, and the aryl ring is preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. However, the carbon number of the “aryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” includes the carbon number 6 of the ring a, ring b, or ring c.
Specific examples of the aryl ring thus formed include a naphthalene ring which is a fused bicyclic ring system; an acenaphthylene ring, a fluorene ring, a phenalene ring, and a phenanthrene ring which are fused tricyclic systems; a triphenylene ring, a pyrene ring, and a naphthacene ring which are fused tetracyclic systems; and a perylene ring and a pentacene ring which are fused pentacyclic systems.
The “heteroaryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” in formula (A') is, for example, a heteroaryl ring having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, and the heteroaryl ring is preferably a heteroaryl ring having 6 to 25 carbon atoms, more preferably a heteroaryl ring having 6 to 20 carbon atoms, still more preferably a heteroaryl ring having 6 to 15 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably a heteroaryl ring having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. In addition, examples of the “heteroaryl ring” include a heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 5 heteroatoms selected from an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and a nitrogen atom in addition to a carbon atom as a ring-constituting atom. However, the carbon number of the “aryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” includes the carbon number 6 of the ring a, ring b, or ring c.
Specific examples of the heteroaryl ring thus formed include an indole ring, an isoindole ring, a 1H-indazole ring, a benzimidazole ring, a benzoxazole ring, a benzothiazole ring, a 1H-benzotriazole ring, a quinoline ring, an isoquinoline ring, a cinnoline ring, a quinazoline ring, a quinoxaline ring, a phthalazine ring, a carbazole ring, an acridine ring, a phenoxathiin ring, a phenoxazine ring, a phenothiazine ring, a phenazine ring, a benzofuran ring, an isobenzofuran ring, a dibenzofuran ring, a benzothiophene ring, a dibenzothiophene ring, and a thianthrene ring.
At least one hydrogen atom in the ring thus formed may be substituted by an aryl, a heteroaryl, a diarylamino, a diheteroarylamino, an arylheteroarylamino, or an aryloxy, while at least one hydrogen atom in these may be further substituted by an aryl, a heteroaryl, or a diarylamino. For this description, the description in R1 to R11 of formula (A') described below can be cited.
Y1 in formulas (A) and (A') represents B.
X1 and X2 in formula (A) each independently represent O or N-R, while R of the N-R represents an optionally substituted aryl, or an optionally substituted heteroaryl or an alkyl, and R of the N-R may be bonded to the ring B and/or ring C by a linking group or a single bond. The linking group is preferably -O-, -S- or -C(-R)2-. Incidentally, R of the “-C(-R)2-” represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl. This description also applies to X1 and X2 in formula (A').
Here, the provision that “R of the N-R is bonded to the ring A, ring B and/or ring C by a linking group or a single bond” in formula (A) corresponds to the provision that “R of the N-R is bonded to the ring a, ring b and/or ring c by -O-, -S-, -C(-R)2- or a single bond” in formula (A').
This provision can be expressed by a compound having a ring structure in which X1 or X2 is incorporated into the fused ring B' or C', represented by the following formula (A'-3-1). That is, for example, the compound is a compound having ring B' (or ring C') that is formed by fusing another ring to a benzene ring which is ring b (or ring c) in formula (A') so as to incorporate X1 (or X2). This compound corresponds to, for example, a compound represented by any one of formulas (1-451) to (1-462) or a compound represented by any one of formulas (1-1401) to (1-1460), listed as specific examples that are described below, and the fused ring B' (or fused ring C') that has been formed is, for example, a phenoxazine ring, a phenothiazine ring, or an acridine ring.
The above provision can be expressed by a compound having a ring structure in which X1 and/or X2 are/is incorporated into the fused ring A', represented by the following formula (A'-3-2) or (A'-3-3). That is, for example, the compound is a compound having ring A' formed by fusing another ring to a benzene ring which is the ring a in formula (A') so as to incorporate X1 (and/or X2). This compound corresponds to, for example, a compound represented by any one of formulas (1-471) to (1-479) listed as specific examples that are described below, and the fused ring A' that has been formed is, for example, a phenoxazine ring, a phenothiazine ring, or an acridine ring. Note that R1 to R3, Y1, X1, and X2 in formula (A'-3-1) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A'), and R4 to R11, Y1, X1, and X2 in formulas (A'-3-2) and (A'-3-3) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').

The “aryl ring” as the ring A, ring B, or ring C of formula (A) is, for example, an aryl ring having 6 to 30 carbon atoms, and the aryl ring is preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably an aryl ring having 6 to 10 carbon atoms. Incidentally, this “aryl ring” corresponds to the “aryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” defined by formula (A'). The ring a (or ring b or ring c) is already constituted by a benzene ring having 6 carbon atoms, and therefore the carbon number of 9 in total of a fused ring obtained by fusing a 5-membered ring to this benzene ring becomes a lower limit of the carbon number.
Specific examples of the “aryl ring” include a benzene ring which is a monocyclic system; a biphenyl ring which is a bicyclic system; a naphthalene ring which is a fused bicyclic system; a terphenyl ring (m-terphenyl, o-terphenyl, or p-terphenyl) which is a tricyclic system; an acenaphthylene ring, a fluorene ring, a phenalene ring and a phenanthrene ring which are fused tricyclic systems; a triphenylene ring, a pyrene ring and a naphthacene ring which are fused tetracyclic systems; and a perylene ring and a pentacene ring which are fused pentacyclic systems. Furthermore, as described below, a group in which each of these aryls is substituted by a heteroaryl defined below is also defined as an aryl here.
The “heteroaryl ring” as the ring A, ring B or ring C of formula (A) is, for example, a heteroaryl ring having 2 to 30 carbon atoms, and the heteroaryl ring is preferably a heteroaryl ring having 2 to 25 carbon atoms, more preferably a heteroaryl ring having 2 to 20 carbon atoms, still more preferably a heteroaryl ring having 2 to 15 carbon atoms, and particularly preferably a heteroaryl having 2 to 10 carbon atoms. In addition, examples of the “heteroaryl ring” include a heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 5 heteroatoms selected from an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, and a nitrogen atom in addition to a carbon atom as a ring-constituting atom. Incidentally, this “heteroaryl ring” corresponds to the “heteroaryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c” defined by formula (A'). The ring a (or ring b or ring c) is already constituted by a benzene ring having 6 carbon atoms, and therefore the carbon number of 6 in total of a fused ring obtained by fusing a 5-membered ring to this benzene ring becomes a lower limit of the carbon number.
Specific examples of the “heteroaryl ring” include a pyrrole ring, an oxazole ring, an isoxazole ring, a thiazole ring, an isothiazole ring, an imidazole ring, an oxadiazole ring, a thiadiazole ring, a triazole ring, a tetrazole ring, a pyrazole ring, a pyridine ring, a pyrimidine ring, a pyridazine ring, a pyrazine ring, a triazine ring, an indole ring, an isoindole ring, a 1H-indazole ring, a benzimidazole ring, a benzoxazole ring, a benzothiazole ring, a 1H-benzotriazole ring, a quinoline ring, an isoquinoline ring, a cinnoline ring, a quinazoline ring, a quinoxaline ring, a phthalazine ring, a naphthyridine ring, a purine ring, a pteridine ring, a carbazole ring, an acridine ring, a phenoxathiin ring, a phenoxazine ring, a phenothiazine ring, a phenazine ring, an indolizine ring, a furan ring, a benzofuran ring, an isobenzofuran ring, a dibenzofuran ring, a thiophene ring, a benzothiophene ring, a dibenzothiophene ring, a furazane ring, an oxadiazole ring, a thianthrene ring, and the N-aryl substituted heteroaryl. Furthermore, as described below, a group in which each of these heteroaryls is substituted by the aryl defined above is also defined as a heteroaryl here.
At least one hydrogen atom in the above “aryl ring” or “heteroaryl ring” may be substituted by a substituted or unsubstituted “aryl”, a substituted or unsubstituted “heteroaryl”, a substituted or unsubstituted “diarylamino”, a substituted or unsubstituted “diheteroarylamino”, a substituted or unsubstituted “arylheteroarylamino”, a substituted or unsubstituted “alkyl”, a substituted or unsubstituted “alkoxy”, or a substituted or unsubstituted “aryloxy”, which is a primary substituent. Examples of the aryl of the “aryl”, “heteroaryl” and “diarylamino”, the heteroaryl of the “diheteroarylamino”, the aryl and heteroaryl of the “arylheteroarylamino” and the aryl of the “aryloxy” as these primary substituents include a monovalent group of the “aryl ring” or “heteroaryl ring” described above.
Furthermore, the “alkyl” as the primary substituent may be either linear or branched, and examples thereof include a linear alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms and a branched alkyl having 3 to 24 carbon atoms. An alkyl having 1 to 18 carbon atoms (branched alkyl having 3 to 18 carbon atoms) is preferable, an alkyl having 1 to 12 carbon atoms (branched alkyl having 3 to 12 carbon atoms) is more preferable, an alkyl having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (branched alkyl having 3 to 6 carbon atoms) is still more preferable, and an alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms (branched alkyl having 3 to 4 carbon atoms) is particularly preferable.
Specific examples of the alkyl include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, t-pentyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylpentyl, 4-methyl-2-pentyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, 2-ethylbutyl, n-heptyl, 1-methylhexyl, n-octyl, t-octyl, 1-methylheptyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-propylpentyl, n-nonyl, 2,2-dimethylheptyl, 2,6-dimethyl-4-heptyl, 3,5,5-trimethylhexyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, 1-methyldecyl, n-dodecyl, n-tridecyl, 1-hexylheptyl, n-tetradecyl, n-pentadecyl, n-hexadecyl, n-heptadecyl, n-octadecyl, and n-eicosyl.
Furthermore, the “alkoxy” as a primary substituent may be, for example, a linear alkoxy having 1 to 24 carbon atoms or a branched alkoxy having 3 to 24 carbon atoms. An alkoxy having 1 to 18 carbon atoms (branched alkoxy having 3 to 18 carbon atoms) is preferable, an alkoxy having 1 to 12 carbon atoms (branched alkoxy having 3 to 12 carbon atoms) is more preferable, an alkoxy having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (branched alkoxy having 3 to 6 carbon atoms) is still more preferable, and an alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms (branched alkoxy having 3 to 4 carbon atoms) is particularly preferable.
Specific examples of the alkoxy include methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, isobutoxy, s-butoxy, t-butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, and octyloxy.
In the substituted or unsubstituted “aryl”, substituted or unsubstituted “heteroaryl”, substituted or unsubstituted “diarylamino”, substituted or unsubstituted “diheteroarylamino”, substituted or unsubstituted “arylheteroarylamino”, substituted or unsubstituted “alkyl”, substituted or unsubstituted “alkoxy”, or substituted or unsubstituted “aryloxy”, which is the primary substituent, at least one hydrogen atom may be substituted by a secondary substituent, as described to be substituted or unsubstituted. Examples of this secondary substituent include an aryl, a heteroaryl, and an alkyl, and for the details thereof, and reference can be made to the above description on the monovalent group of the “aryl ring” or “heteroaryl ring” and the “alkyl” as the primary substituent. Furthermore, regarding the aryl or heteroaryl as the secondary substituent, an aryl or heteroaryl in which at least one hydrogen atom is substituted by an aryl such as phenyl (specific examples are described above), or an alkyl such as methyl (specific examples are described above) is also included in the aryl or heteroaryl as the secondary substituent. For instance, when the secondary substituent is a carbazolyl group, a carbazolyl group in which at least one hydrogen atom at the 9-position is substituted by an aryl such as phenyl or an alkyl such as methyl is also included in the heteroaryl as the secondary substituent.
Examples of the aryl, the heteroaryl, the aryl of the diarylamino, the heteroaryl of the diheteroarylamino, the aryl and the heteroaryl of the arylheteroarylamino, or the aryl of the aryloxy for R1 to R11 of formula (A') include the monovalent groups of the “aryl ring” or “heteroaryl ring” described in formula (A). Furthermore, regarding the alkyl or alkoxy for R1 to R11, reference can be made to the description on the “alkyl” or “alkoxy” as the primary substituent in the above description of formula (A). In addition, similar description applies to the aryl, heteroaryl or alkyl as the substituent for these groups.

1-1-4. Substitution on Compound
At least one hydrogen atom in a compound represented by formula (A) or (A') (at least one hydrogen atom in an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring in the compound) may be substituted by a group represented by formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, further any -CH2- in the alkyl may be substituted by -O- or -Si(CH3)2-, any -CH2- excluding -CH2- directly bonded to the compound in the alkyl may be substituted by an arylene having 6 to 24 carbon atoms, and any hydrogen atom in the alkyl may be substituted by a fluorine atom.
A group represented by formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms can further improve solubility in a solvent, film formability, wet coatability, thermal stability, and in-plane orientation of a compound because of being substituted by an appropriate length and structure at an appropriate position of a molecule.
One of molecular design guidelines for solubility control is to impart flexibility to molecules. Because of this, it is considered that solubility can be improved or controlled by reducing a cohesive force between solid molecules and promoting immediate solvent infiltration upon dissolution. In general, an alkyl chain is introduced into a molecule. However, in a case of use as an organic EL element, the alkyl chain may inhibit accumulation of molecules and may break a carrier path, and therefore a driving voltage of the organic EL element may be raised or mobility may be lowered.
In such a situation, it has been found that high solubility can be imparted without deteriorating a characteristic of the organic EL element by introducing a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) having a structure in which phenylene is linked at an m-position. When a plurality of rotations between a phenyl and a phenyl in a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) is combined, the group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) can draw a large rotating volume and is very flexible. Therefore, it is considered that a derivative to which a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) is imparted can have high solubility. Particularly, as a group represented by formula (FG-1) is longer, flexibility is higher, and higher solubility can be imparted to a molecule. Therefore, a longer group is more preferable from a viewpoint of solubility. A structure that does not interfere with flexibility of a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) throughout a molecule is preferable because flexibility of the group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) is utilized to the utmost and sufficient solubility is imparted thereto.
In addition, it is known that a biphenyl structure has a planar structure with an angle of 0° between phenyl rings in a crystal. Similarly, a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) can have a planar structure in a solid. A group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) has flexibility in a solution. However, it is considered that flexibility of the group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) is suppressed after film formation, and molecules are sufficiently densely packed in a film. This generates a carrier transporting path in the film, and therefore leads to an improvement in carrier mobility and a reduction in drive voltage. Particularly, as a group represented by formula (FG-1) is shorter, the density of a structure of portions other than the group represented by formula (FG-1) responsible for the path can be higher. Therefore, a shorter group is more preferable from a viewpoint of the carrier transporting path.
Here, the term “wet coatability” means a measure of smoothness and uniformity of a film formed with wet coatability. During wet film formation, when solubility is low, a film cannot be formed but a crystal may be deposited. On the other hand, when solubility is high, a film defect such as a pinhole or cissing may be generated. Strictly speaking, when there is an extremely large difference from other components in solubility, component separation may occur. Furthermore, compatibility with a solvent, a composition, and a film formation/drying/baking step may have an influence on a film quality, and precise adjustment of each element may be required in order to obtain a high-quality film. Therefore, it is considered that control of solubility without changing HOMO and LUMO of a molecule leads to control of wet coatability.
A group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) can control solubility without having a large influence on a structure of portions other than the group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) responsible for HOMO or LUMO. In addition, the group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2) can give a certain range to solubility, and can adjust a light emitting layer-forming composition flexibly.
Stability during driving of an organic EL element is estimated by thermal stability (glass transition point). It is considered that a cohesive force of a molecule may be increased in order to raise the glass transition point. That is, as solubility is improved more, the molecule may be more flexible, the glass transition point may be lower, and thermal stability may be lower.
By imparting a group represented by formula (FG-1), flexibility can be imparted to a molecule, while dense packing can be expected in a film. As a result, molecular motion can be restricted, and therefore stability to internal and external heat may be improved. As a group represented by formula (FG-1) is longer, a molecule can be larger, and Tg can be raised from a viewpoint of thermal stability. A group represented by formula (FG-2) has higher planarity than a group represented by formula (FG-1), and therefore has a larger effect of raising Tg.
In order to improve characteristics of a compound used for an organic EL element, studies have been made to impart in-plane orientation by giving a rigid structure to a molecule. In general, a compound having in-plane orientation has a rigid and highly linear structure like a p-terphenyl, and therefore has poor solubility.
However, contrary to conventional common general technical knowledge, the present inventors have found that high in-plane orientation can be imparted even to a molecule which is not rigid by performing a substitution such that a group represented by formula (FG-1) is long and the molecule has a rod-like shape. In this case, the molecule does not have a rigid and highly linear structure, and therefore solubility is never lowered. Preferably, a group represented by formula (FG-1) is long and the molecule has a rod-like shape from a viewpoint of in-plane orientation. When a group represented by formula (FG-1) is sufficiently long, high in-plane orientation can be exhibited even when a molecule is bent.
Even in a molecule into which an alkyl chain is introduced, deterioration of characteristics of an organic EL element can be prevented by controlling a chain length and a structure such that the alkyl chain does not inhibit accumulation of the molecules.
In a compound represented by formula (A) or (A'), at least one hydrogen atom in a molecule is preferably substituted by a group represented by formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 7 to 24 carbon atoms from a viewpoint of improving coating film formability and in-plane orientation. More preferably, at least one hydrogen atom in a molecule is substituted by a group represented by formula (FG-1) or (FG-2). Particularly preferably, at least one hydrogen atom in a molecule is substituted by a group represented by formula (FG-1).

In general, when a molecule into which an alkyl chain is introduced is used as an organic EL element, the alkyl chain may inhibit accumulation of the molecules and may break a carrier path. Meanwhile, even in a molecule into which an alkyl chain is introduced, deterioration of characteristics of an organic EL element can be prevented by controlling a chain length and a structure such that the alkyl chain does not inhibit accumulation of the molecules.

1-3. Organic Solvent
The light emitting layer-forming composition of the present invention contains at least one organic solvent as a third component. By controlling an evaporation rate of an organic solvent at the time of film formation, it is possible to control and improve film formability, presence or absence of defects in a coating film, surface roughness, and smoothness. At the time of film formation using an ink jet method, by controlling meniscus stability at a pinhole of an ink jet head, ejection performance can be controlled and improved. In addition, by controlling a drying speed of a film and orientation of a derivative molecule, it is possible to improve electrical characteristics, luminescence characteristics, efficiency, and a lifetime of an organic EL element having a light emitting layer obtained from the light emitting layer-forming composition.
1-3-1. Physical Properties of Organic Solvent
In the third component, the boiling point of at least one organic solvent is from 130° C. to 300° C., more preferably from 140° C. to 270° C., and still more preferably from 150° C. to 250° C. A case where the boiling point is higher than 130° C. is preferable from a viewpoint of ink jet ejection performance. A case where the boiling point is lower than 300° C. is preferable from a viewpoint of defects in a coating film, surface roughness, a residual solvent, and smoothness. The third component more preferably contains two or more kinds of organic solvents from a viewpoint of good ink jet ejection performance, film formability, smoothness, and the small amount of a residual solvent. Meanwhile, in some cases, in consideration of transportability and the like, the third component may be a solid composition obtained by removing a solvent from the light emitting layer-forming composition.
Furthermore, a particularly preferable configuration is that the third component contains a good solvent (GS) and a poor solvent (PS) for at least one of compounds represented by formulas (B-1) to (B-6), and the boiling point (BPGS) of the good solvent (GS) is lower than the boiling point (BPPS) of the poor solvent (PS).
By adding a poor solvent having a high boiling point, a good solvent having a low boiling point is volatilized earlier at the time of film formation, and the concentration of contents in the composition and the concentration of the poor solvent are increased to promote prompt film formation. As a result, a coating film having few defects, less surface roughness, and high smoothness can be obtained.
A difference in solubility (SGS−SPS) is preferably 1% or more, more preferably 3% or more, and still more preferably 5% or more. A difference in boiling point (BPPS−BPGS) is preferably 10° C. or more, more preferably 30° C. or more, and still more preferably 50° C. or more.
After the film formation, an organic solvent is removed from a coating film through a drying step such as evacuation, reduction in pressure, or heating. In a case of heating, heating is preferably performed at a glass transition temperature (Tg) of the first component +30° C. or lower from a viewpoint of improving coating film formability. Heating is preferably performed at a glass transition point (Tg) of the first component −30° C. or higher from a viewpoint of reducing a residual solvent. Even when the heating temperature is lower than the boiling point of an organic solvent, the organic solvent is sufficiently removed because the film is thin. Drying may be performed a plurality of times at different temperatures, or a plurality of drying methods may be used in combination.

Meanwhile, the light emitting layer-forming composition having a high surface tension brings about good ink jet ejection performance. Therefore, the surface tension of the light emitting layer-forming composition is preferably from 20 mN/m to 40 mN/m, and more preferably from 20 mN/m to 30 mN/m at 25° C. In the present invention, the surface tension is a value measured using a hanging drop method.
2. Manufacturing Method
Hereinafter, a method for manufacturing a compound represented by general formula (A) or (A') and compounds represented by general formulas (B-1) to (B-6) will be described.
2-1. Method for Manufacturing Compound Represented by General Formula (A), (A'), or (B-5)
Compounds represented by general formulas (A), (A'), and (B-5) and multimer compounds thereof are contained in the first component and the second component in the light emitting layer-forming composition of the present invention, and are different constituent components from one another. However, manufacturing methods thereof are similar to one another, and therefore will be described collectively.
In regard to compounds represented by general formulas (A), (A'), and (B-5), and multimer compounds thereof, basically, an intermediate is first manufactured by bonding the ring A (ring a), ring B (ring b), and ring C (ring c) with a bonding group (a group containing X1 or X2) (first reaction), and then a final product can be manufactured by bonding the ring A (ring a), ring B (ring b), and ring C (ring c) with a bonding group (a group containing Y1) (second reaction). In the first reaction, for example, in an etherification reaction, a general reaction such as a nucleophilic substitution reaction or an Ullmann reaction can be utilized, and in an amination reaction, a general reaction such as a Buchwald-Hartwig reaction can be utilized. In the second reaction, a Tandem Hetero-Friedel-Crafts reaction (continuous aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction, the same hereinafter) can be utilized.
The second reaction is a reaction for introducing Y1 that bonds the ring A (ring a), ring B (ring b), and ring C (ring c) as illustrated in the following scheme (1) or (2), and as an example, a case in which Y1 represents a boron atom, and X1 and X2 represent nitrogen atoms is indicated below. First, a hydrogen atom between X1 and X2 is ortho-metalated with n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, t-butyllithium, or the like. Subsequently, boron trichloride, boron tribromide, or the like is added thereto to perform lithium-boron metal exchange, and then a Brønsted base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine is added thereto to induce a Tandem Bora-Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, a desired product can be obtained. In the second reaction, a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride may be added in order to accelerate the reaction. Note that R1 to R11 and R of N-R in structural formulas in schemes (1) and (2) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').

<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00166.TIF </img>
Incidentally, the scheme (1) or (2) mainly illustrates a method for manufacturing a polycyclic aromatic compound represented by general formula (A) or (A'). However, a multimer compound thereof can be manufactured using an intermediate having a plurality of ring A's (ring a's), ring B's (ring b's) and ring C's (ring c's). More specifically, the manufacturing method will be described with the following schemes (3) to (5). In this case, a desired product can be obtained by increasing the amount of a reagent used therein such as butyllithium to a double amount or a triple amount. Note that R1 to R11 and R of N-R in structural formulas in schemes (3) to (5) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').

<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00169.TIF </img>
In the above schemes, a lithium atom is introduced to a desired position by ortho-metalation. However, a lithium atom can also be introduced to a desired position by halogen-metal exchange by introducing a bromine atom or the like to a position to which it is wished to introduce lithium, as in the following schemes (6) and (7). Note that R1 to R11 and R in N-R in structural formulas in schemes (6) and (7) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00170.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00171.TIF </img>
Furthermore, also in regard to the method for manufacturing a multimer described in scheme (3), a lithium atom can be introduced to a desired position also by halogen-metal exchange by introducing a halogen atom such as a bromine atom or a chlorine atom to a position to which it is wished to introduce a lithium atom, as in the above schemes (6) and (7) (the following schemes (8), (9), and (10)). Note that R1 to R11 and R of N-R in structural formulas in schemes (8) to (10) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00172.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00173.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00174.TIF </img>
According to this method, a desired product can also be synthesized even in a case where ortho-metalation cannot be achieved due to an influence of substituents, and therefore, the method is useful.
By appropriately selecting the synthesis method described above and appropriately selecting raw materials to be used, a polycyclic aromatic compound having substituents at desired positions, with Y1 being a boron atom and X1 and X2 being nitrogen atoms, and a multimer compound thereof can be synthesized.
Next, as examples, a case where Y1 represents a boron atom, X1 represents an oxygen atom, and X2 represents a nitrogen atom will be illustrated in the following schemes (11) and (12), and a case where X1 and X2 represent oxygen atoms will be illustrated in the following scheme (13). Similarly to the case where X1 and X2 are nitrogen atoms, first, a hydrogen atom between X1 and X2 is ortho-metalated with n-butyllithium or the like. Subsequently, boron tribromide or the like is added thereto to induce lithium-boron metal exchange, and then a Brønsted base such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine is added thereto to induce a Tandem Bora-Friedel-Crafts reaction. Thus, a desired product can be obtained. In this reaction, a Lewis acid such as aluminum trichloride may also be added in order to accelerate the reaction. Note that R1 to R11 and R of N-R in structural formulas in schemes (11) to (13) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00175.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00176.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00177.TIF </img>
Specific examples of a solvent used in the above reactions include t-butylbenzene and xylene.
Furthermore, in general formula (A') or (B-5), adjacent groups among the substituents R1 to R11 of the ring a, ring b, and ring c may be bonded to each other to form an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring together with the ring a, ring b, or ring c, and at least one hydrogen atom in the ring thus formed may be substituted by an aryl or a heteroaryl. Therefore, in a polycyclic aromatic compound represented by general formula (A') or (B-5), a ring structure constituting the compound changes as represented by formulas (A'-1) and (A'-2) of the following schemes (14) and (15) according to a mutual bonding form of substituents in the ring a, ring b, and ring c. These compounds can be synthesized by applying synthesis methods illustrated in the above schemes (1) to (13) to intermediates illustrated in the following schemes (14) and (15). Note that R1 to R11, Y1, X1, and X2 in structural formulas in schemes (14) and (15) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A').
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00178.TIF </img>
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00179.TIF </img>
The ring A', ring B' and ring C' in the above formulas (A'-1) and (A'-2) each represent an aryl ring or a heteroaryl ring formed by bonding adjacent groups among the substituents R1 to R11 together with the ring a, ring b, and ring c, respectively (may also be referred to as a fused ring obtained by fusing another ring structure to the ring a, ring b, or ring c). Incidentally, although not indicated in the formula, there is also a compound in which all of the ring a, ring b, and ring c have been changed to the ring A', ring B' and ring C'.
Furthermore, the provision that “R of the N-R is bonded to the ring a, ring b, and/or ring c with -O-, -S-, -C(-R)2-, or a single bond” in general formulas (A') and (B-5) can be expressed as a compound having a ring structure represented by formula (A'-3-1) of the following scheme (16), in which X1 or X2 is incorporated into the fused ring B' or fused ring C', or a compound having a ring structure represented by formula (A'-3-2) or formula (A'-3-3), in which X1 or X2 is incorporated into the fused ring A'. Such a compound can be synthesized by applying the synthesis methods illustrated in the above schemes (1) to (13) to the intermediate represented by the following scheme (16). Note that R1 to R11, Y1, X1, and X2 in structural formulas in scheme (16) are defined in the same manner as those in formula (A')
<img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00180.TIF </img><img> id-US20180094000A1-20180405-C00181.TIF </img>
Furthermore, there has been illustrated an example of performing a Tandem Hetero-Friedel-Crafts reaction by ortho-metalating a hydrogen atom (or a halogen atom) between X1 and X2 with butyllithium or the like, before boron trichloride, boron tribromide, or the like is added. However, the reaction may be caused to proceed by adding boron trichloride, boron tribromide, or the like without performing ortho-metalation using butyllithium or the like.
Note that examples of an ortho-metalation reagent used for the above schemes include an alkyllithium such as methyllithium, n-butyllithium, sec-butyllithium, or t-butyllithium; and an organic alkali compound such as lithium diisopropylamide, lithium tetramethylpiperidide, lithium hexamethyldisilazide, or potassium hexamethyldisilazide.
Incidentally, examples of a metal exchanging reagent for metal-Y1 (boron) used for the above schemes include a halide of Y1 such as trifluoride of Y1, trichloride of Y1, tribromide of Y1, or triiodide of Y1; an aminated halide of Y1 such as CIPN(NEt2)2; an alkoxylation product of Y1; and an aryloxylation product of Y1.
Incidentally, examples of the Brønsted base used for the above schemes include N,N-diisopropylethylamine, triethylamine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, 1,2,2,6,6-pentamethylpiperidine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N,N-dimethyltoluidine, 2,6-lutidine, sodium tetraphenylborate, potassium tetraphenylborate, triphenylborane, tetraphenylsilane, Ar4BNa, Ar4BK, Ar3B, and Ar4Si (note that Ar represents an aryl such as phenyl).
Examples of a Lewis acid used for the above schemes include AlCl3, AlBr3, AlF3, BF3□OEt2, BCl3, BBr3, GaCl3, GaBr3, InCl3, InBr3, In(OTf)3, SnCl4, SnBr4, AgOTf, ScCl3, Sc(OTf)3, ZnCl2, ZnBr2, Zn(OTf)2, MgCl2, MgBr2, Mg(OTf)2, LiOTf, NaOTf, KOTf, Me3SiOTf, Cu(OTf)2, CuCl2, YCl3, Y(OTf)3, TiCl4, TiBr4, ZrCl4, ZrBr4, FeCl3, FeBr3, COCl3, and CoBr3.
In the above schemes, a Brønsted base or a Lewis acid may be used in order to accelerate the Tandem Hetero Friedel-Crafts reaction. However, in a case where a halide of Y1 such as trifluoride of Y1, trichloride of Y1, tribromide of Y1, or triiodide of Y1 is used, an acid such as hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, or hydrogen iodide is generated along with progress of an aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction. Therefore, it is effective to use a Brønsted base that captures an acid. On the other hand, in a case where an aminated halide of Y1 or an alkoxylation product of Y1 is used, an amine or an alcohol is generated along with progress of the aromatic electrophilic substitution reaction. Therefore, in many cases, it is not necessary to use a Brønsted base. However, leaving ability of an amino group or an alkoxy group is low, and therefore it is effective to use a Lewis acid that promotes leaving of these groups.
Furthermore, in order to obtain a compound substituted by a group represented by formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, these groups may be introduced into an intermediate in advance, or may be introduced after the second reaction. Introduction of a deuterium atom or a halogen atom is similar.
2-2. Method for Manufacturing Compounds Represented by General Formulas (B-1) to (B-4)
Compounds represented by formulas (B-1) to (B-4) can be synthesized by a known method using a halogenated aryl derivative and an aryl boronic acid derivative as starting materials, or using a halogenated aryl boronic acid derivative, a halogenated aryl derivative, and an aryl boronic acid derivative as starting materials, by appropriately combining Suzuki Miyaura coupling, Kumada⋅Tamao⋅Corriu coupling, Negishi coupling, a halogenation reaction, and a boroxidation reaction.
Reactive functional groups of a halide and a boronic acid derivative in Suzuki-Miyaura coupling may be replaced with each other appropriately. In Kumada⋅Tamao⋅Corriu coupling or Negishi coupling, similarly, functional groups involved in these reactions may be replaced with each other similarly. In a case where conversion to a Grignard reagent is performed, a metallic magnesium and an isopropyl grignard reagent may be appropriately replaced with each other. A boronic acid ester may be used as it is, or may be used as a boronic acid after hydrolysis with an acid. In a case of using a boronic acid ester, an alkyl group other than the exemplified alkyl groups may be used as an alkyl group of an ester moiety.
Specific examples of a palladium catalyst used in a reaction include tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(0): Pd(PPh3)4, bis(triphenylphosphine) palladium(II) dichloride: PdCl2(PPh3)2, palladium(II) acetate: Pd(OAc)2, tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium(0): Pd2(dba)3, a tris(dibenzylideneacetone) dipalladium(0) chloroform complex: Pd2(dba)3.CHCl3, bis(dibenzylideneacetone) palladium(0): Pd(dba)2, bis(tri-t-butylphosphino) palladium(0): Pd (t-Bu3P)2, [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene] dichloropalladium(II): Pd(dppf)Cl2, a [1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino) ferrocene] dichloropalladium(II) dichloromethane complex (1:1): Pd(dppf)Cl2.CH2Cl2, PdCl2{P(t-Bu)2-(p-NMe2-Ph)}2: (A-taPhos)2PdCl2, palladium bis(dibenzylidene), [1, 3-bis(diphenylphosphino) propane] nickel(II) dichloride, and PdCl2[P(t-Bu)2-(p-NMe2-Ph)]2: (A-taPhos)2PdCl2 (Pd-132: trademark; manufactured by Johnson Matthey Co., Ltd.).
In order to accelerate the reaction, a phosphine compound may be optionally added to these palladium compounds. Specific examples of the phosphine compound include tri(t-butyl) phosphine, tricyclohexylphosphine, 1-(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)-2-(di-t-butylphosphino) ferrocene, 1-(N,N-dibutylaminomethyl)-2-(di-t-butylphosphino) ferrocene, 1-(methoxymethyl)-2-(di-t-butylphosphino) ferrocene, 1,1'-bis(di-t-butylphosphino) ferrocene, 2,2'-bis(di-t-butylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl, 2-methoxy-2'-(di-t-butylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl, and 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',6'-dimethoxybiphenyl.
Specific examples of a base used in the reaction include sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium t-butoxide, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, tripotassium phosphate, and potassium fluoride.
Specific examples of a solvent used in the reaction include benzene, toluene, xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, anisole, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, 1,4-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, t-butyl alcohol, cyclopentyl methyl ether, and isopropyl alcohol. These solvents can be appropriately selected, and may be used singly or as a mixed solvent.
2-3. Method for Manufacturing Compound Represented by General Formula (B-6)
A compound represented by formula (B-6) can be synthesized by appropriately combining the methods described in the “method for manufacturing compounds represented by general formulas (B-1) to (B-4)”.
A solvent used in the reaction may be an ether solvent and the like in addition to solvents described in the “method for manufacturing compounds represented by general formulas (B-1) to (B-4)”. Examples thereof include dimethoxyethane, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethane, and 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy) ethane.
A base may be added as an aqueous solution, and a reaction may be caused in a two-phase system. In a case of a reaction in a two-phase system, a phase transfer catalyst such as a quaternary ammonium salt may be added, if necessary.
When formula (B-6) is manufactured, formula (B-6) may be manufactured in one stage or multiple stages. Formula (B-6) may be manufactured by a batch polymerization method in which a reaction is started after the whole amount of a raw material is put in a reaction vessel, by a dropping polymerization method in which a raw material is added dropwise to a reaction vessel, by a precipitation polymerization method in which a product is precipitated with progress of a reaction, or by appropriately combining these methods. For example, when a compound represented by formula (B-6) is synthesized in one stage, a reaction is caused in a state where a monomer unit (MU) and an endcap unit (EC) are added to a reaction vessel, and a desired product is thereby obtained. Furthermore, when a compound represented by formula (B-6) is synthesized in multiple stages, a monomer unit (MU) is polymerized to a target molecular weight, and then an endcap unit (EC) is added thereto for a reaction to obtain a desired product.
Furthermore, if a polymerizable group of a monomer unit (MU) is selected, a primary structure of a polymer can be controlled. For example, as illustrated in 1 to 3 of synthesis scheme (20), a polymer having a random primary structure (1 in synthesis scheme (20)), a polymer having a regular primary structure (2 and 3 in synthesis scheme (20)), and the like can be synthesized, and can be appropriately combined and used according to a desired product.

3. Organic Electroluminescent Element
The light emitting layer-forming composition according to the present invention is used as a material of an organic EL element manufactured by a wet film formation method. Hereinafter, an organic EL element according to the present embodiment will be described in detail based on the drawings. FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating the organic EL element according to the present embodiment.
3-1. Structure of Organic Electroluminescent Element
An organic EL element 100 illustrated in FIG. 1 includes a substrate 101, a positive electrode 102 provided on the substrate 101, a hole injection layer 103 provided on the positive electrode 102, a hole transport layer 104 provided on the hole injection layer 103, a light emitting layer 105 provided on the hole transport layer 104, an electron transport layer 106 provided on the light emitting layer 105, an electron injection layer 107 provided on the electron transport layer 106, and a negative electrode 108 provided on the electron injection layer 107.
Incidentally, the organic EL element 100 may be configured, by reversing the manufacturing order, to include, for example, the substrate 101, the negative electrode 108 provided on the substrate 101, the electron injection layer 107 provided on the negative electrode 108, the electron transport layer 106 provided on the electron injection layer 107, the light emitting layer 105 provided on the electron transport layer 106, the hole transport layer 104 provided on the light emitting layer 105, the hole injection layer 103 provided on the hole transport layer 104, and the positive electrode 102 provided on the hole injection layer 103.
In general, an organic EL element having a normal manufacturing order is called an organic EL element of a forward structure, and an organic EL element having an inverse manufacturing order is called an organic EL element of a reverse structure. The same materials may be used for the organic EL element of a forward structure and the organic EL element of a reverse structure. However, as for a positive electrode and a negative electrode, a material of the positive electrode 102 of an organic EL element of a forward structure is used as a material of the negative electrode 108 of an organic EL element of a reverse structure, and a material of the negative electrode 108 of an organic EL element of a forward structure is used as a material of the positive electrode 102 of an organic EL element of a reverse structure. Unless otherwise specified, the following description will be given for an organic EL element of a forward structure.
Not all of the above layers are essential. The configuration includes the positive electrode 102, the light emitting layer 105, and the negative electrode 108 as a minimum constituent unit, while the hole injection layer 103, the hole transport layer 104, the electron transport layer 106, and the electron injection layer 107 are optionally provided. Each of the above layers may be formed of a single layer or a plurality of layers.
A form of layers constituting the organic EL element may be, in addition to the above structure form of “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, a structure form of “substrate/positive electrode/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole transport layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/light emitting layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/hole injection layer/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/negative electrode”, “substrate/positive electrode/light emitting layer/electron transport layer/negative electrode”, or “substrate/positive electrode/light emitting layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode”.
3-2. Substrate in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The substrate 101 serves as a support of the organic EL element 100, and usually, quartz, glass, metals, plastics, and the like are used. The substrate 101 is formed into a plate shape, a film shape, or a sheet shape according to a purpose, and for example, a glass plate, a metal plate, a metal foil, a plastic film, and a plastic sheet are used. Among these examples, a glass plate and a plate made of a transparent synthetic resin such as polyester, polymethacrylate, polycarbonate, or polysulfone are preferable. For a glass substrate, soda lime glass, alkali-free glass, and the like are used. The thickness is only required to be a thickness sufficient for maintaining mechanical strength. Therefore, the thickness is only required to be 0.2 mm or more, for example. The upper limit value of the thickness is, for example, 2 mm or less, and preferably 1 mm or less. Regarding a material of glass, glass having fewer ions eluted from the glass is desirable, and therefore alkali-free glass is preferable. However, soda lime glass which has been subjected to barrier coating with SiO2 or the like is also commercially available, and therefore this soda lime glass can be used. Furthermore, the substrate 101 may be provided with a gas barrier film such as a dense silicon oxide film on at least one surface in order to increase a gas barrier property. Particularly in a case of using a plate, a film, or a sheet made of a synthetic resin having a low gas barrier property as the substrate 101, a gas barrier film is preferably provided.
3-3. Positive Electrode in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The positive electrode 102 plays a role of injecting a hole into the light emitting layer 105. Incidentally, in a case where the hole injection layer 103 and/or the hole transport layer 104 are/is provided between the positive electrode 102 and the light emitting layer 105, a hole is injected into the light emitting layer 105 through these layers.
Examples of a material to form the positive electrode 102 include an inorganic compound and an organic compound. Examples of the inorganic compound include a metal (aluminum, gold, silver, nickel, palladium, chromium, and the like), a metal oxide (indium oxide, tin oxide, indium-tin oxide (ITO), indium-zinc oxide (IZO), and the like), a metal halide (copper iodide and the like), copper sulfide, carbon black, ITO glass, and Nesa glass. Examples of the organic compound include an electrically conductive polymer such as a polythiophene such as poly(3-methylthiophene), polypyrrole, or polyaniline. In addition to these compounds, a material can be appropriately selected for use from materials used as a positive electrode of an organic EL element.
A resistance of a transparent electrode is not limited as long as a sufficient current can be supplied to light emission of a luminescent element. However, low resistance is desirable from a viewpoint of consumption power of the luminescent element. For example, an ITO substrate having a resistance of 300Ω/□ or less functions as an element electrode. However, a substrate having a resistance of about 10Ω/□ can be also supplied at present, and therefore it is particularly desirable to use a low resistance product having a resistance of, for example, 100 to 5Ω/□, preferably 50 to 5Ω/□. The thickness of an ITO can be arbitrarily selected according to a resistance value, but an ITO having a thickness of 50 to 300 nm is usually used in many cases.
3-4. Hole Injection Layer and Hole Transport Layer in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The hole injection layer 103 plays a role of efficiently injecting a hole that migrates from the positive electrode 102 into the light emitting layer 105 or the hole transport layer 104. The hole transport layer 104 plays a role of efficiently transporting a hole injected from the positive electrode 102 or a hole injected from the positive electrode 102 through the hole injection layer 103 to the light emitting layer 105. The hole injection layer 103 and the hole transport layer 104 are each formed by laminating and mixing one or more kinds of hole injection/transport materials, or by a mixture of hole injection/transport materials and a polymer binder. Furthermore, a layer may be formed by adding an inorganic salt such as iron(III) chloride to the hole injection/transport materials.
A hole injection/transport substance needs to efficiently inject/transport a hole from a positive electrode between electrodes to which an electric field is applied, and preferably has high hole injection efficiency and transports an injected hole efficiently. For this purpose, a substance which has low ionization potential, large hole mobility, and excellent stability, and in which impurities that serve as traps are not easily generated at the time of manufacturing and at the time of use, is preferable.
As a material to form the hole injection layer 103 and the hole transport layer 104, any compound can be selected for use among compounds that have been conventionally used as charge transport materials for holes, p-type semiconductors, and known compounds used in a hole injection layer and a hole transport layer of an organic EL element. Specific examples thereof include a heterocyclic compound including a carbazole derivative (N-phenylcarbazole, polyvinylcarbazole, and the like), a biscarbazole derivative such as bis(N-arylcarbazole) or bis(N-alkylcarbazole), a triarylamine derivative (a polymer having an aromatic tertiary amino in a main chain or a side chain, 1,1-bis(4-di-p-tolylaminophenyl)cyclohexane, N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-di(3-methylphenyl)-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl, N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-dinaphthyl-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl, N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-di(3-methylphenyl)-4,4'-diphenyl-1,1'-di amine, N,N'-dinaphthyl-N,N'-diphenyl-4,4'-dphenyl-1,1'-diamine, N4,N4'-diphenyl-N4,N4'-bis(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine, N4,N4,N4',N4'-tetra[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine, a triphenylamine derivative such as 4,4',4″-tris(3-methylphenyl(phenyl)amino)triphenylamine, a starburst amine derivative, and the like), a stilbene derivative, a phthalocyanine derivative (non-metal, copper phthalocyanine, and the like), a pyrazoline derivative, a hydrazone-based compound, a benzofuran derivative, a thiophene derivative, an oxadiazole derivative, a quinoxaline derivative (for example, 1,4,5,8,9,12-hexaazatriphenylene-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexacarbonitrile, and the like), and a porphyrin derivative, and a polysilane. Among the polymer-based materials, a polycarbonate, a styrene derivative, a polyvinylcarbazole, a polysilane, and the like having the above monomers in side chains are preferable. However, there is no particular limitation as long as a compound can form a thin film needed for manufacturing a luminescent element, can inject a hole from a positive electrode, and can transport a hole.
Furthermore, it is also known that electroconductivity of an organic semiconductor is strongly affected by doping into the organic semiconductor. Such an organic semiconductor matrix substance is formed of a compound having a good electron-donating property, or a compound having a good electron-accepting property. For doping with an electron-donating substance, a strong electron acceptor such as tetracyanoquinonedimethane (TCNQ) or 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorotetracyano-1,4-benzoquinonedimethane (F4TCNQ) is known (see, for example, “M. Pfeiffer, A. Beyer, T. Fritz, K. Leo, Appl. Phys. Lett., 73(22), 3202-3204 (1998)” and “J. Blochwitz, M. Pheiffer, T. Fritz, K. Leo, Appl. Phys. Lett., 73(6), 729-731 (1998)”). These compounds generate a so-called hole by an electron transfer process in an electron-donating type base substance (hole transporting substance). Electroconductivity of the base substance depends on the number and mobility of the holes fairly significantly. Known examples of a matrix substance having a hole transporting characteristic include a benzidine derivative (TPD and the like), a starburst amine derivative (TDATA and the like), and a specific metal phthalocyanine (particularly, zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) and the like) (JP 2005-167175 A).
In addition, as a material for forming the hole injection layer 103 and the hole transport layer 104 by a wet film formation method, in addition to the above materials for forming the hole injection layer 103 and the hole transport layer 104 used for vapor deposition, a hole injecting and hole transporting polymer, a hole injecting and hole transporting crosslinkable polymer, a hole injecting and hole transporting polymer precursor, a polymerization initiator, and the like can be used.

3-5. Light Emitting Layer in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The light emitting layer 105 emits light by recombining a hole injected from the positive electrode 102 and an electron injected from the negative electrode 108 between electrodes to which an electric field is applied. A material to form the light emitting layer 105 is a compound excited by recombination between a hole and an electron and emits light (luminescent compound), and is a compound which can form a stable thin film shape, and exhibits strong light emission (fluorescence) efficiency in a solid state.
The light emitting layer may be formed of a single layer or a plurality of layers, and each layer is formed of a material for a light emitting layer (a host material and a dopant material). Each of the host material and the dopant material may be formed of a single kind, or a combination of a plurality of kinds. The dopant material may be included in the host material wholly or partially. The composition of the present invention can be used for forming a light emitting layer, and a compound constituting the composition, represented by formula (A) or (A') functions as a dopant material, and compounds represented by formulas (B-1) to (B-6) function as a host material.
The content of a host material in the light emitting layer is preferably from 83.3% by weight to 99.9% by weight, more preferably from 80% by weight to 99.5% by weight, and still more preferably from 90 to 1.0% by weight with respect to the total amount of a material for the light emitting layer.
The content of the dopant is preferably from 0.1% by weight to 25% by weight, more preferably from 0.5 to 20% by weight, and still more preferably from 1.0 to 10% by weight with respect to the total amount of a material for the light emitting layer. The amount of use within the above range is preferable, for example, from a viewpoint of being able to prevent a concentration quenching phenomenon.
3-6. Electron Injection Layer and Electron Transport Layer in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The electron injection layer 107 plays a role of efficiently injecting an electron migrating from the negative electrode 108 into the light emitting layer 105 or the electron transport layer 106. The electron transport layer 106 plays a role of efficiently transporting an electron injected from the negative electrode 108, or an electron injected from the negative electrode 108 through the electron injection layer 107 to the light emitting layer 105. The electron transport layer 106 and the electron injection layer 107 are each formed by laminating and mixing one or more kinds of electron transport/injection materials, or by a mixture of an electron transport/injection material and a polymeric binder.
An electron injection/transport layer is a layer that manages injection of an electron from a negative electrode and transport of an electron, and is preferably a layer that has high electron injection efficiency and can efficiently transport an injected electron. For this purpose, a substance which has high electron affinity, large electron mobility, and excellent stability, and in which impurities that serve as traps are not easily generated at the time of manufacturing and at the time of use, is preferable. However, when a transport balance between a hole and an electron is considered, in a case where the electron injection/transport layer mainly plays a role of efficiently preventing a hole coming from a positive electrode from flowing toward a negative electrode side without being recombined, even if electron transporting ability is not so high, an effect of enhancing light emission efficiency is equal to that of a material having high electron transporting ability. Therefore, the electron injection/transport layer according to the present embodiment may also include a function of a layer that can efficiently prevent migration of a hole.
A material (electron transport material) for forming the electron transport layer 106 or the electron injection layer 107 can be arbitrarily selected for use from a compound conventionally used as an electron transfer compound in a photoconductive material, and known compounds that are used in an electron injection layer and an electron transport layer of an organic EL element.

Specific examples of the material include a fused ring-based aromatic ring derivative of naphthalene, anthracene, or the like, a styryl-based aromatic ring derivative represented by 4,4'-bis(diphenylethenyl)biphenyl, a perinone derivative, a coumarin derivative, a naphthalimide derivative, a quinone derivative such as anthraquinone or diphenoquinone, a phosphorus oxide derivative, a carbazole derivative, and an indole derivative. Examples of the metal complex having an electron-accepting nitrogen atom include a hydroxyazole complex such as a hydroxyphenyloxazole complex, an azomethine complex, a tropolone metal complex, a flavonol metal complex, and a benzoquinoline metal complex. These materials are used singly, but may also be used in a mixture with other materials.
Furthermore, specific examples of other electron transfer compounds include a pyridine derivative, a naphthalene derivative, an anthracene derivative, a phenanthroline derivative, a perinone derivative, a coumarin derivative, a naphthalimide derivative, an anthraquinone derivative, a diphenoquinone derivative, a diphenylquinone derivative, a perylene derivative, an oxadiazole derivative (1,3-bis[(4-t-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazolyl]phenylene and the like), a thiophene derivative, a triazole derivative (N-naphthyl-2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-triazole and the like), a thiadiazole derivative, a metal complex of an oxine derivative, a quinolinol-based metal complex, a quinoxaline derivative, a polymer of a quinoxaline derivative, a benzazole compound, a gallium complex, a pyrazole derivative, a perfluorinated phenylene derivative, a triazine derivative, a pyrazine derivative, a benzoquinoline derivative (2,2'-bis(benzo[h]quinolin-2-yl)-9,9'-spirobifluorene and the like), an imidazopyridine derivative, a borane derivative, a benzimidazole derivative (tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene and the like), a benzoxazole derivative, a benzothiazole derivative, a quinoline derivative, an oligopyridine derivative such as terpyridine, a bipyridine derivative, a terpyridine derivative (1,3-bis(4'-(2,2':6'2″-terpyridinyl))benzene and the like), a naphthyridine derivative (bis(1-naphthyl)-4-(1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)phenylphosphine oxide and the like), an aldazine derivative, a carbazole derivative, an indole derivative, a phosphorus oxide derivative, and a bistyryl derivative.
Furthermore, a metal complex having an electron-accepting nitrogen atom can also be used, and examples thereof include a quinolinol-based metal complex, a hydroxyazole complex such as a hydroxyphenyloxazole complex, an azomethine complex, a tropolone-metal complex, a flavonol-metal complex, and a benzoquinoline-metal complex.

An electron transport layer or an electron injection layer may further contain a substance that can reduce a material to form an electron transport layer or an electron injection layer. As this reducing substance, various substances are used as long as having reducibility to a certain extent. For example, at least one selected from the group consisting of an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal, a rare earth metal, an oxide of an alkali metal, a halide of an alkali metal, an oxide of an alkaline earth metal, a halide of an alkaline earth metal, an oxide of a rare earth metal, a halide of a rare earth metal, an organic complex of an alkali metal, an organic complex of an alkaline earth metal, and an organic complex of a rare earth metal, can be suitably used.
Preferable examples of the reducing substance include alkali metals such as Na (work function 2.36 eV), K (work function 2.28 eV), Rb (work function 2.16 eV), and Cs (work function 1.95 eV); and alkaline earth metals such as Ca (work function 2.9 eV), Sr (work function 2.0 to 2.5 eV), and Ba (work function 2.52 eV). Among these substances, an alkali metal such as K, Rb, or Cs is a more preferable reducing substance, Rb or Cs is a still more preferable reducing substance, and Cs is the most preferable reducing substance. These alkali metals have particularly high reducing ability, and can enhance emission luminance of an organic EL element or can lengthen a lifetime thereof by adding the alkali metals in a relatively small amount to a material to form an electron transport layer or an electron injection layer. Furthermore, as the reducing substance having a work function of 2.9 eV or less, a combination of two or more kinds of these alkali metals is also preferable, and particularly, a combination including Cs, for example, a combination of Cs with Na, a combination of Cs with K, a combination of Cs with Rb, or a combination of Cs with Na and K, is preferable. By inclusion of Cs, reducing ability can be efficiently exhibited, and emission luminance of an organic EL element is enhanced or a lifetime thereof is lengthened by adding Cs to a material to form an electron transport layer or an electron injection layer.
3-7. Negative Electrode in Organic Electroluminescent Element
The negative electrode 108 plays a role of injecting an electron to the light emitting layer 105 through the electron injection layer 107 and the electron transport layer 106.
A material to form the negative electrode 108 is not particularly limited as long as being a substance capable of efficiently injecting an electron to an organic layer. However, a material similar to the materials to form the positive electrode 102 can be used. Among these materials, a metal such as tin, indium, calcium, aluminum, silver, copper, nickel, chromium, gold, platinum, iron, zinc, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, or magnesium, and alloys thereof (a magnesium-silver alloy, a magnesium-indium alloy, an aluminum-lithium alloy such as lithium fluoride/aluminum, and the like) are preferable. In order to enhance element characteristics by increasing electron injection efficiency, lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium, calcium, magnesium, or an alloy containing these low work function-metals is effective. However, many of these low work function-metals are generally unstable in air. In order to ameliorate this problem, for example, a method for using an electrode having high stability obtained by doping an organic layer with a trace amount of lithium, cesium, or magnesium is known. Other examples of a dopant that can be used include an inorganic salt such as lithium fluoride, cesium fluoride, lithium oxide, or cesium oxide. However, the dopant is not limited thereto.
Furthermore, in order to protect an electrode, a metal such as platinum, gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, aluminum, or indium, an alloy using these metals, an inorganic substance such as silica, titania, or silicon nitride, polyvinyl alcohol, vinyl chloride, a hydrocarbon-based polymer compound, or the like may be laminated as a preferable example. A method for manufacturing these electrodes is not particularly limited as long as being able to obtain conduction, such as resistance heating, electron beam deposition, sputtering, ion plating, or coating.
3-8. Binder that May be Used in Each Layer
A material used in the above hole injection layer, hole transport layer, light emitting layer, electron transport layer, and electron injection layer can form each of the layers by being used singly. However, it is also possible to use the material by dispersing the material in a solvent-soluble resin such as polyvinyl chloride, polycarbonate, polystyrene, poly(N-vinylcarbazole), polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, polyester, polysulfone, polyphenylene oxide, polybutadiene, a hydrocarbon resin, a ketone resin, a phenoxy resin, polyamide, ethyl cellulose, a vinyl acetate resin, an ABS resin, or a polyurethane resin, a curable resin such as a phenolic resin, a xylene resin, a petroleum resin, a urea resin, a melamine resin, an unsaturated polyester resin, an alkyd resin, an epoxy resin, or a silicone resin, or the like.
3-9. Method for Manufacturing Organic Electroluminescent Element
Each of layers constituting an organic EL element can be formed by forming a thin film of a material to constitute each of the layers by a method such as a vapor deposition method, resistance heating deposition, electron beam deposition, sputtering, a molecular lamination method, a printing method, a spin coating method, a casting method, a coating method, or a laser heating drawing method (LITI). The film thickness of each of the layers thus formed is not particularly limited, and can be appropriately set according to a property of a material, but is usually within a range of 2 nm to 5000 nm.
3-9-1. Wet Film Formation Method
The light emitting layer-forming composition of the present invention is formed using a wet film formation method.
In the wet film formation method, generally, a coating film is formed through an applying step of applying a light emitting layer-forming composition onto a substrate and a drying step of removing a solvent from the applied light emitting layer-forming composition. According to a difference in the applying step, a method using a spin coater is referred to as a spin coating method, a method using a slit coater is referred to as a slit coating method, a method using a plate is referred to gravure, offset, reverse offset, and flexographic printing methods, a method using an ink jet printer is referred to as an ink jet method, and a method for spraying the composition is referred to as a spraying method. Examples of the drying step include methods of air drying, heating, and drying under reduced pressure. The drying step may be performed only once, or may be performed a plurality of times using different methods and conditions. Furthermore, different methods may be used in combination like calcination under reduced pressure.
The wet film formation method is a film formation method using a solution, and examples thereof include a part of printing methods (ink jet method), a spin coating method, a casting method, and a coating method. Unlike a vacuum deposition method, the wet film formation method does not need to use an expensive vacuum deposition apparatus, and a film can be formed under atmospheric pressure. In addition, the wet film formation method can increase an area and manufacture a product continuously, leading to reduction in manufacturing cost.
Meanwhile, as compared with the vacuum deposition method, lamination is difficult by the wet film formation method. In a case where a laminated film is manufactured using the wet film formation method, it is necessary to prevent dissolution of a lower layer due to a composition of an upper layer, and techniques of using a composition with controlled solubility, crosslinking the lower layer, using orthogonal solvents (solvents which are not dissolved in each other), and the like are used. However, even with these techniques, it may be difficult to use the wet film formation method for application to all the films.
Therefore, in general, a method is adopted in which only some of the layers are formed by the wet film formation method and the remaining layers are formed by the vacuum deposition method to manufacture an organic EL element.
For example, a procedure for partially applying the wet film formation method to manufacture an organic EL element will be described below.
(Procedure 1) Film formation of positive electrode by vacuum deposition method
(Procedure 2) Film formation of hole injection layer by wet film formation method
(Procedure 3) Film formation of hole transport layer by wet film formation method
(Procedure 4) Film formation of light emitting layer-forming composition containing host material and dopant material by wet film formation method
(Procedure 5) Film formation of electron transport layer by vacuum deposition method
(Procedure 6) Film formation of electron injection layer by vacuum deposition method
(Procedure 7) Film formation of negative electrode by vacuum deposition method
Through this procedure, an organic EL element formed of anode/hole injection layer/hole transport layer/light emitting layer including a host material and a dopant material/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode is obtained.
3-9-2. Other Film Formation Method
For film formation of the light emitting layer-forming composition, a laser heating drawing method (LITI) can be used. LITI is a method for heating and depositing a compound attached to a base material with a laser, and the light emitting layer-forming composition can be used for a material to be applied to a base material.
3-9-3. Optional Step
A suitable treatment step, washing step, and drying step may be appropriately performed before and after each of the steps of film formation. Examples of the treatment step include an exposure treatment, a plasma surface treatment, an ultrasonic treatment, an ozone treatment, a washing treatment using a suitable solvent, and a heat treatment. Examples of the treatment step further include a series of steps for manufacturing a bank.
3-9-3-1. Bank (Partition Wall Material)
A photolithography technique can be used for manufacturing a bank. As a bank material that can be used for photolithography, a positive resist material and a negative resist material can be used. A patternable printing method such as an ink jet method, gravure offset printing, reverse offset printing, or screen printing can also be used. In this case, a permanent resist material can also be used.
Examples of a material used for a bank include a polysaccharide and a derivative thereof, a homopolymer and a copolymer of a hydroxyl-containing ethylenic monomer, a biopolymer compound, a polyacryloyl compound, polyester, polystyrene, polyimide, polyamideimide, polyetherimide, polysulfide, polysulfone, polyphenylene, polyphenyl ether, polyurethane, epoxy (meth)acrylate, melamine (meth)acrylate, polyolefin, cyclic polyolefin, an acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS), a silicone resin, polyvinyl chloride, chlorinated polyethylene, chlorinated polypropylene, polyacetate, polynorbonene, a synthetic rubber, a fluorinated polymer such as polyfluorovinylidene, polytetrafluoroethylene, or polyhexafluoropropylene pyrene, a fluoroolefin-hydrocarbon olefin copolymer, and a fluorocarbon polymer, but are not limited thereto.
3-10. Example of Manufacturing Organic Electroluminescent Element
Next, an example of a method for manufacturing an organic EL element by a vacuum deposition method and a wet film formation method using an ink jet will be described.
3-10-1. Example of Manufacturing Organic Electroluminescent Element by Vacuum Deposition Method
As an example of a method for manufacturing an organic EL element by a vacuum deposition method, a method for manufacturing an organic EL element formed of positive electrode/hole injection layer/hole transport layer/light emitting layer including a host material and a dopant material/electron transport layer/electron injection layer/negative electrode will be described. A thin film of a positive electrode material is formed on an appropriate substrate to manufacture a positive electrode by a vapor deposition method or the like, and then thin films of a hole injection layer and a hole transport layer are formed on this positive electrode. A thin film is formed thereon by co-depositing a host material and a dopant material to obtain a light emitting layer. An electron transport layer and an electron injection layer are formed on this light emitting layer, and a thin film formed of a substance for a negative electrode is formed by a vapor deposition method or the like to obtain a negative electrode. An intended organic EL element is thereby obtained. Incidentally, in manufacturing the above organic EL element, it is also possible to manufacture the element by reversing the manufacturing order, that is, in order of a negative electrode, an electron injection layer, an electron transport layer, a light emitting layer, a hole transport layer, a hole injection layer, and a positive electrode.
3-10-2. Example of Manufacturing Organic Electroluminescent Element by Ink Jet
With reference to FIG. 2, a method for manufacturing an organic EL element on a substrate having a bank by an ink jet method will be described. First, a bank (200) is provided on an electrode (120) on a substrate (110). In this case, a coating film (130) can be manufactured by dropping an ink droplet (310) between the banks (200) from an ink jet head (300) and drying the ink droplet (310). If this process is repeated, a subsequent coating film (140) and a light emitting layer (150) are manufactured, and an electron transport layer, an electron injection layer, and an electrode are formed by a vacuum deposition method, an organic EL element in which a light emitting part is partitioned by a bank material can be manufactured.
3-11. Confirmation of Electric Characteristics and Luminescence Characteristics of Organic Electroluminescent Element
In a case where a direct current voltage is applied to the organic EL element thus obtained, it is only required to apply the voltage by using a positive electrode as a positive polarity and using a negative electrode as a negative polarity. By applying a voltage of about 2 to 40 V, light emission can be observed from a transparent or semitransparent electrode side (the positive electrode or the negative electrode, or both the electrodes). This organic EL element also emits light even in a case where a pulse current or an alternating current is applied. Note that a waveform of an alternating current applied may be any waveform.
3-12. Application Example of Organic Electroluminescent Element
The present invention can also be applied to a display apparatus including an organic EL element, a lighting apparatus including an organic EL element, or the like.
The display apparatus or lighting apparatus including an organic EL element can be manufactured by a known method such as connecting the organic EL element according to the present embodiment to a known driving apparatus, and can be driven by appropriately using a known driving method such as direct driving, pulse driving, or alternating driving.
Examples of the display apparatus include panel displays such as color flat panel displays; and flexible displays such as flexible organic electroluminescent (EL) displays (see, for example, JP 13035066 A, JP 2003-321546 A, JP 2004-281806 A, and the like). Examples of a display method of the display include a matrix method and/or a segment method. Note that the matrix display and the segment display may co-exist in the same panel.
A matrix refers to a system in which pixels for display are arranged two-dimensionally as in a lattice form or a mosaic form, and characters or images are displayed by an assembly of pixels. The shape or size of the pixel depends on intended use. For example, for display of images and characters of a personal computer, a monitor, or a television, square pixels each having a size of 300 μm or less on each side are usually used, and in a case of a large-sized display such as a display panel, pixels having a size in the order of millimeters on each side are used. In a case of monochromic display, it is only required to arrange pixels of the same color. However, in a case of color display, display is performed by arranging pixels of red, green and blue. In this case, typically, delta type display and stripe type display are available. For this matrix driving method, either a line sequential driving method or an active matrix method may be employed. The line sequential driving method has an advantage of having a simpler structure. However, in consideration of operation characteristics, the active matrix method may be superior. Therefore, it is necessary to use the line sequential driving method and the active matrix method properly according to intended use.
In the segment method (type), a pattern is formed so as to display predetermined information, and a determined region emits light. Examples of the segment method include display of time or temperature in a digital clock or a digital thermometer, display of a state of operation in an audio instrument or an electromagnetic cooker, and panel display in an automobile.
Examples of the lighting apparatus include a lighting apparatuses for indoor lighting or the like, and a backlight of a liquid crystal display apparatus (see, for example, JP 2003-257621 A, JP 2003-277741 A, and JP 2004-119211 A). The backlight is mainly used for enhancing visibility of a display apparatus that is not self-luminous, and is used in a liquid crystal display apparatus, a timepiece, an audio apparatus, an automotive panel, a display panel, a sign, and the like. Particularly, in a backlight for use in a liquid crystal display apparatus, among the liquid crystal display apparatuses, for use in a personal computer in which thickness reduction has been a problem to be solved, in consideration of difficulty in thickness reduction because a conventional type backlight is formed from a fluorescent lamp or a light guide plate, a backlight using the luminescent element according to the present embodiment is characterized by its thinness and lightweightness.

After completion of dropwise addition, the temperature was increased to 60° C., the mixture was stirred for two hours, and then the components having boiling points that were lower than that of t-butylbenzene were distilled off under reduced pressure. The residue was cooled to −50° C., boron tribromide (11.6 ml) was added thereto, the temperature was raised to room temperature, and the mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours. Thereafter, the mixture was cooled again in an ice bath, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (6.0 g) was added thereto. The mixture was stirred at room temperature until heat generation was settled, subsequently the temperature of the mixture was raised to 100° C., and the mixture was heated and stirred for two hours. The reaction liquid was cooled to room temperature, an aqueous solution of sodium acetate that had been cooled in an ice bath and then ethyl acetate were added thereto, and the mixture was partitioned. Concentration was performed under reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was washed with heptane.

<Evaluation of Coating Film Formability>
A light emitting layer-forming composition was subjected to coating film formation onto a 4×4 cm glass substrate by a spin coating method, and the degree of film defects was evaluated. A product in which a film was not formed on the substrate after film formation and a product with a pinhole in a coating film were evaluated as “poor”, and a product without a pinhole was evaluated as “good”.
The light emitting layer-forming composition of the present invention had excellent coating film formability. The light emitting layer-forming composition containing a compound represented by general formula (A) and compounds represented by general formulas (B-1) to (B-6), substituted by a group represented by general formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms exhibits better coating film formability than a compound not substituted by these groups. Furthermore, when both a host compound and a dopant compound are substituted by a group represented by general formula (FG-1), a group represented by formula (FG-2), or an alkyl having 1 to 24 carbon atoms, a higher fluorescence quantum yield is obtained than a case where only either the host compound or the dopant compound is substituted by these groups.
<Evaluation of in-Plane Orientation>
In-plane orientation of a host compound in a vapor deposited film or a coating film can be calculated by evaluating anisotropy of a refractive index and an extinction coefficient with an ellipsometer (Daisuke Yokoyama, Akio Sakaguchi, Michio Suzuki, Chihaya Adachi, Applied Physics Letters, 96, 073302 (2010), Daisuke Yokoyama, Journal of Materials Chemistry, 21, 19187-19202 (2011)). Furthermore, in-plane orientation of a light-emitting compound in a vapor deposited film or a coating film can be calculated by measuring angle dependence of a light emission intensity of p-polarized light of the light-emitting compound, and comparing a measurement result with a simulation result (Jorg Frischeisen, Daisuke Yokoyama, Chihaya Adachi, Wolfgang Brutting, Applied Physics Letters, 96, 073302 (2010)).
<Preparation and Evaluation of Organic EL Element>
Example 16 describes a method for manufacturing an organic EL element using a crosslinkable hole transport material. Example 17 describes a method for manufacturing an organic EL element using an orthogonal solvent system. Table 1 indicates a material configuration of each of layers in an organic EL element manufactured.

<PEDOT:PSS Solution>
A commercially available PEDOT:PSS solution (Clevios™ P VP AI4083, aqueous dispersion of PEDOT:PSS, manufactured by Heraeus Holdings) was used.
<Preparation of OTPD Solution>
OTPD (LT-N159, manufactured by Luminescence Technology Corp.) and IK-2 (photocation polymerization initiator, manufactured by Sun Apro Co.) were dissolved in toluene, and an OTPD solution having an OTPD concentration of 0.7 wt % and IK-2 concentration of 0.007 wt % was prepared.
<Preparation of PCz Solution>
PCz (polyvinylcarbazole) was dissolved in dichlorobenzene to prepare a 0.7 wt % PCz solution.
Example 16
A PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on a glass substrate on which ITO had been vapor-deposited so as to have a thickness of 150 nm, and was baked on a hot plate at 200° C. for one hour to form a PEDOT:PSS film with a film thickness of 40 nm (hole injection layer). Subsequently, the OTPD solution was spin-coated and dried on a hot plate at 80° C. for 10 minutes. Exposure was performed with an exposure machine at an exposure intensity of 100 mJ/cm2, and baking was performed on a hot plate at 100° C. for one hour to form an OTPD film with a thickness of 30 nm, insoluble in a solution (hole transport layer). Subsequently, the light emitting layer-forming composition prepared in Example 3 was spin-coated and baked on a hot plate at 120° C. for one hour to form a light emitting layer with a thickness of 20 nm.
The prepared multilayer film was fixed to a substrate holder of a commercially available vapor deposition apparatus (manufactured by Showa Shinku Co., Ltd.). A molybdenum deposition boat containing ET1, a molybdenum deposition boat containing LiF, and a tungsten deposition boat containing aluminum were attached thereto. A vacuum chamber was evacuated to 5×10−4 Pa. Thereafter, the deposition boat containing ET1 was heated, and vapor deposition was performed so as to obtain a film thickness of 30 nm to form an electron transport layer. A deposition rate during formation of the electron transport layer was 1 nm/sec. Thereafter, the vapor deposition boat containing LiF was heated, and vapor deposition was performed at a deposition rate of 0.01 to 0.1 nm/sec so as to obtain a film thickness of 1 nm. Subsequently, the boat containing aluminum was heated, and vapor deposition was performed so as to obtain a film thickness of 100 nm. Thus, a negative electrode was formed. In this way, an organic EL element was obtained.

Subsequently, a PCz solution was spin-coated and baked on a hot plate at 120° C. for one hour to form a PCz film having a thickness of 30 nm (hole transport layer). Subsequently, the light emitting layer-forming composition prepared in Example 3 was spin-coated and baked on a hot plate at 120° C. for one hour to form a light emitting layer with a thickness of 20 nm. Subsequently, an electron transport layer and a negative electrode were vapor-deposited in a similar manner to Example 16 to obtain an organic EL element.

<Evaluation of Coating Film Formability>
Each of the light emitting layer-forming compositions according to Examples 18 to 38 and Comparative Example 1 was subjected to coating film formation onto a 4×4 cm glass substrate by a spin coating method, and the degree of film defects was evaluated. After film formation, a product in which a film was not formed on the substrate and a product in which a pinhole could be visually confirmed in a coating film were evaluated as “x”, and a product in which a pinhole could not be visually confirmed was evaluated as “∘”. Furthermore, a coating film which was evaluated as “∘” was caused to emit light using a UV lamp, and then was visually observed. A product in which no unevenness of light emission was observed at an end portion of the substrate was evaluated as “⊙”. Table 3 indicates results thereof.
<Evaluation of Light Emitting Characteristics>
A film of each of the light emitting layer-forming compositions according to Examples 18 to 38 and Comparative Example 1 was formed on a glass (EagleXG) substrate (40 mm×40 mm) by a spin coating method. A fluorescence spectrum (Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer F-7000, excitation wavelength 360 nm) of the coating film in a central portion of the substrate was measured, and maximum emission wavelength (nm) and a half width (nm) were determined. Note that the half width of the spectrum was obtained as a width between upper and lower wavelengths where the intensity was 50% with respect to the maximum emission wavelength. Furthermore, a luminescence quantum yield was measured with a fluorescence quantum yield measuring apparatus (Hamamatsu Photonics) using a glass substrate (10×10 mm) with a coating film, having a central portion cut out, with reference to a glass (Eagle XG) substrate (10×10 mm).
