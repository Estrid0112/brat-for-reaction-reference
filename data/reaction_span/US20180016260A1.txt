FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present application is concerned with pharmaceutically active compounds. The disclosure provides compounds as well as their compositions and methods of use. The compounds modulate PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction and are useful in the treatment of various diseases including infectious diseases and cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The immune system plays an important role in controlling and eradicating diseases such as cancer. However, cancer cells often develop strategies to evade or to suppress the immune system in order to favor their growth. One such mechanism is altering the expression of co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory molecules expressed on immune cells (Postow et al, J. Clinical Oncology 2015, 1-9). Blocking the signaling of an inhibitory immune checkpoint, such as PD-1, has proven to be a promising and effective treatment modality.
Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), also known as CD279, is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells, natural killer T cells, B cells, and macrophages (Greenwald et al, Annu. Rev. Immunol 2005, 23:515-548; Okazaki and Honjo, Trends Immunol 2006, (4): 195-201). It functions as an intrinsic negative feedback system to prevent the activation of T-cells, which in turn reduces autoimmunity and promotes self-tolerance. In addition, PD-1 is also known to play a critical role in the suppression of antigen-specific T cell response in diseases like cancer and viral infection (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007 8, 239-245; Postow et al, J. Clinical Oncol 2015, 1-9).
The structure of PD-1 consists of an extracellular immunoglobulin variable-like domain followed by a transmembrane region and an intracellular domain (Parry et al, Mol Cell Biol 2005, 9543-9553). The intracellular domain contains two phosphorylation sites located in an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif, which suggests that PD-1 negatively regulates T cell receptor-mediated signals. PD-1 has two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2 (Parry et al, Mol Cell Biol 2005, 9543-9553; Latchman et al, Nat Immunol 2001, 2, 261-268), and they differ in their expression patterns. PD-L1 protein is upregulated on macrophages and dendritic cells in response to lipopolysaccharide and GM-CSF treatment, and on T cells and B cells upon T cell receptor and B cell receptor signaling. PD-L1 is also highly expressed on almost all tumor cells, and the expression is further increased after IFN-γ treatment (Iwai et al, PNAS2002, 99(19):12293-7; Blank et al, Cancer Res 2004, 64(3):1140-5). In fact, tumor PD-L1 expression status has been shown to be prognostic in multiple tumor types (Wang et al, Eur J Surg Oncol 2015; Huang et al, Oncol Rep 2015; Sabatier et al, Oncotarget 2015, 6(7): 5449-5464). PD-L2 expression, in contrast, is more restricted and is expressed mainly by dendritic cells (Nakae et al, J Immunol 2006, 177:566-73). Ligation of PD-1 with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 on T cells delivers a signal that inhibits IL-2 and IFN-γ production, as well as cell proliferation induced upon T cell receptor activation (Carter et al, Eur J Immunol 2002, 32(3):634-43; Freeman et al, J Exp Med 2000, 192(7): 1027-34). The mechanism involves recruitment of SHP-2 or SHP-1 phosphatases to inhibit T cell receptor signaling such as Syk and Lck phosphorylation (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007, 8, 239-245). Activation of the PD-1 signaling axis also attenuates PKC-θ activation loop phosphorylation, which is necessary for the activation of NF-κB and API pathways, and for cytokine production such as IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF (Sharpe et al, Nat Immunol 2007, 8, 239-245; Carter et al, Eur J Immunol 2002, 32(3):634-43; Freeman et al, J Exp Med 2000, 192(7):1027-34).
Several lines of evidence from preclinical animal studies indicate that PD-1 and its ligands negatively regulate immune responses. PD-1-deficient mice have been shown to develop lupus-like glomerulonephritis and dilated cardiomyopathy (Nishimura et al, Immunity 1999, 11:141-151; Nishimura et al, Science 2001, 291:319-322). Using an LCMV model of chronic infection, it has been shown that PD-1/PD-L1 interaction inhibits activation, expansion and acquisition of effector functions of virus-specific CD8 T cells (Barber et al, Nature 2006, 439, 682-7). Together, these data support the development of a therapeutic approach to block the PD-1-mediated inhibitory signaling cascade in order to augment or “rescue” T cell response. Accordingly, there is a need for new compounds that block PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction.

It is further appreciated that certain features of the invention, which are, for clarity, described in the context of separate embodiments, can also be provided in combination in a single embodiment (while the embodiments are intended to be combined as if written in multiply dependent form). Conversely, various features of the invention which are, for brevity, described in the context of a single embodiment, can also be provided separately or in any suitable subcombination. Thus, it is contemplated as features described as embodiments of the compounds of Formula (I) can be combined in any suitable combination.
At various places in the present specification, certain features of the compounds are disclosed in groups or in ranges. It is specifically intended that such a disclosure include each and every individual subcombination of the members of such groups and ranges. For example, the term “C1-6 alkyl” is specifically intended to individually disclose (without limitation) methyl, ethyl, C3 alkyl, C4 alkyl, C5 alkyl and C6 alkyl.

For example, -NR(CR'R″)n- includes both -NR(CR'R″)n- and -(CR'R″)nNR- and is intended to disclose each of the forms individually. Where the structure requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking group and the Markush group definition for that variable lists “alkyl” or “aryl” then it is understood that the “alkyl” or “aryl” represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group, respectively.

The substituents are independently selected, and substitution may be at any chemically accessible position. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom results in a chemically stable molecule. The phrase “optionally substituted” means unsubstituted or substituted. The term “substituted” means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substituent. A single divalent substituent, e.g., oxo, can replace two hydrogen atoms.

IV. Formulation, Dosage Forms and Administration
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the present disclosure can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus the present disclosure provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula (I) or any of the formulas as described herein, a compound as recited in any of the claims and described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or any of the embodiments thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is indicated and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, e.g., by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, the compound of the present disclosure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, e.g., a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, e.g., up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art see, e.g., WO 2002/000196.
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents. The compositions of the invention can be formulated so as to provide quick, sustained or delayed release of the active ingredient after administration to the patient by employing procedures known in the art.
In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition comprises silicified microcrystalline cellulose (SMCC) and at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the silicified microcrystalline cellulose comprises about 98% microcrystalline cellulose and about 2% silicon dioxide w/w.
In some embodiments, the composition is a sustained release composition comprising at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one component selected from microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyethylene oxide. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. In some embodiments, the composition comprises at least one compound described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate and polyethylene oxide. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises magnesium stearate or silicon dioxide. In some embodiments, the microcrystalline cellulose is Avicel PH102™. In some embodiments, the lactose monohydrate is Fast-flo 316™. In some embodiments, the hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 K4M (e.g., Methocel K4 M Premier™) and/or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 2208 K100LV (e.g., Methocel K00LV™). In some embodiments, the polyethylene oxide is polyethylene oxide WSR 1105 (e.g., Polyox WSR 1105™).
In some embodiments, a wet granulation process is used to produce the composition. In some embodiments, a dry granulation process is used to produce the composition.
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1,000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 mg to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 10 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 50 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 25 mg of the active ingredient. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.
The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade). Particularly for human consumption, the composition is preferably manufactured or formulated under Good Manufacturing Practice standards as defined in the applicable regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For example, suitable formulations may be sterile and/or substantially isotonic and/or in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms and the like.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, e.g., the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, e.g., about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask, tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, e.g., liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white Vaseline, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g., glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, e.g., glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2 or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, e.g., 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, e.g., the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
V. Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
The compounds of the present disclosure can further be useful in investigations of biological processes in normal and abnormal tissues. Thus, another aspect of the present invention relates to labeled compounds of the invention (radio-labeled, fluorescent-labeled, etc.) that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating PD-1 or PD-L1 protein in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying PD-L1 ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes PD-1/PD-L1 binding assays that contain such labeled compounds.
The present invention further includes isotopically-labeled compounds of the disclosure. An “isotopically” or “radio-labeled” compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature (i.e., naturally occurring). Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to deuterium, 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. For example, one or more hydrogen atoms in a compound of the present disclosure can be replaced or substituted by deuterium atoms. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. For example, for in vitro PD-L1 protein labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I, 131I, 35S or will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful.
It is to be understood that a “radio-labeled” or “labeled compound” is a compound that has incorporated at least one radionuclide. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S and 82Br. In some embodiments, the compound incorporates 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 deuterium atoms. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are known in the art.
Compounds of the invention can also include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the intermediates or final compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. One or more constituent atoms of the compounds of the invention can be replaced or substituted with isotopes of the atoms in natural or non-natural abundance. In some embodiments, the compound includes at least one deuterium atom. For example, one or more hydrogen atoms in a compound of the present disclosure can be replaced or substituted by deuterium. In some embodiments, the compound includes two or more deuterium atoms. In some embodiments, the compound includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 deuterium atoms. Synthetic methods for including isotopes into organic compounds are known in the art.
Specifically, a labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify and/or evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a PD-L1 protein by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the PD-L1 protein, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a PD-L1 protein (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the PD-L1 protein directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.
VI. Kits
The present disclosure also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, e.g., in the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders associated with the activity of PD-L1 including its interaction with other proteins such as PD-1 and B7-1 (CD80), such as cancer or infections, which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or any of the embodiments thereof. Such kits can further include one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, e.g., containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the Examples have been found to inhibit the activity of PD-1/PD-L1 protein/protein interaction according to at least one assay described herein.

Recombinant human PD-L1 protein (19-238) with a His-tag at the C-terminus was purchased from AcroBiosystems (PD1-H5229). Recombinant human PD-1 protein (25-167) with Fc tag at the C-terminus was also purchased from AcroBiosystems (PD1-H5257). PD-L1 and PD-1 proteins were diluted in the assay buffer and 10 μL was added to the plate well. Plates were centrifuged and proteins were preincubated with inhibitors for 40 minutes. The incubation was followed by the addition of 10 μL of HTRF detection buffer supplemented with Europium cryptate-labeled anti-human IgG (PerkinElmer-AD0212) specific for Fc and anti-His antibody conjugated to SureLight®-Allophycocyanin (APC, PerkinElmer-AD0059H). After centrifugation, the plate was incubated at 25° C. for 60 min. before reading on a PHERAstar FS plate reader (665 nm/620 nm ratio). Final concentrations in the assay were-3 nM PD1, 10 nM PD-L1, 1 nM europium anti-human IgG and 20 nM anti-His-Allophycocyanin. IC50 determination was performed by fitting the curve of percent control activity versus the log of the inhibitor concentration using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
Compounds of the present disclosure, as exemplified in Examples 1-13, showed IC50 values in the following ranges: +=IC50≦100 nM; ++=100 nM<IC50≦500 nM; +++=500 nM<IC50≦10000 nM
Data obtained for the Example compounds using the PD-1/PD-L1 homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) binding assay described in Example A is provided in Table 1.
