FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is related to compounds having AMPA receptor modulating properties, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, chemical processes for preparing these compounds and their use in the treatment of diseases associated with AMPA receptor activity in animals, in particular humans.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in mammalian brain. Glutamatergic signaling participates in a wide range of neural functions including learning and memory, long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity.
Glutamate receptors can be divided into two families. The ionotropic glutamate receptors form ion channels that activate upon binding agonist, opening a pore through the plasma membrane through which cations can flow. The metabotropic glutamate receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors, activating intracellular signal transduction cascades. The ionotropic glutamate receptors can be further subdivided into four sub-families, based upon sequence homology and selectivity to exogenous agonists. These sub-families are the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid), NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate), kainate, and delta receptors.
The AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels expressed primarily on postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. AMPA receptors assemble as tetramers of subunits. Mammals express four AMPA-receptor subunits, called GluA1-GluA4. Each GluA subunit can be expressed in multiple splice variants; the two most prominent splice variants are called flop and flip. GluA subunits freely form functional homo- and hetero-tetramers. The majority of RNA encoding GluA2 subunits is edited post-transcriptionally, altering a genetically-encoded glutamine to arginine. This RNA editing causes AMPA receptors to preferentially form with two GluA2 units, and also prevents calcium entry through the activated receptor.
In their native environment, the pore-forming GluA tetramers directly or indirectly associate with numerous auxiliary proteins which modify the trafficking, localization, gating characteristics, and pharmacology of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR). These auxiliary subunits include cytoskeletal and anchoring proteins, other signaling proteins, and several intracellular and transmembrane proteins with unknown function. The wide variety of proteins which can participate in AMPA receptor complexes vastly increases the ability of a neuron to tune the response characteristics of its synapses.
Transmembrane AMPA Receptor Regulatory Proteins (TARPs) are a fairly recently discovered family of proteins that have been found to associate with and modulate the activity of AMPA receptors. (Gill and Bredt., Neuropsychopharmacology 36(1): 362-363 (2011). Several TARPs exhibit regiospecific expression in the brain, leading to physiological differentiation of the AMPA receptor activity. For example, TARP γ2-dependent AMPA receptors are primarily localized in the cerebellum and cerebral cortex while TARP γ8-dependent AMPA receptors are localized primarily in the hippocampus.
AMPA receptors mediate the majority of fast neurotransmission across synaptic gaps. Thus, inhibition or negative modulation of AMPA receptors is an attractive strategy for therapeutic intervention in CNS disorders characterized by excessive neuronal activity. However, since AMPA receptor activity is so ubiquitous within CNS, general antagonism affects most areas of the CNS resulting in undesired effects, such as ataxia, sedation, and/or dizziness, which are shared by all known general AMPA receptor antagonists.
Epilepsy affects over 50 million people world-wide, with 30-40% of treated patients being resistant to current pharmacotherapies and only about 8% of treated patients being maintained seizure free. Epilepsy is often defined as when a person has two or more unprovoked epileptic seizures. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines an epileptic seizure as “a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Seizures are thought to have a number of underlying causalities which adds to the difficulty in treating epilepsy. Seizures have been divided according to their clinical presentation including generalized seizures (absence, atonic, tonic-clonic (grand mal), and myoclonic), simple and complex partial onset seizures, gelastic seizures, dacrystic seizures, and status epilepticus. Current therapies target a variety of mechanisms including GABA γ-aminobutyric acid) receptor agonism, T-type calcium channel blockers, sodium channel modulators, synaptic vesicle protein SV2A modulation, and inhibition of GABA transaminase. More recently, AMPA receptor antagonists have been investigated for treatment of seizures as well.
AMPA receptor antagonists are known anticonvulsant agents. Typically, AMPA receptor antagonists have very narrow therapeutic dosing windows; the doses needed to obtain anticonvulsant activity are close to or overlap with doses at which undesired effects are observed. (Michael A. Rogawski. “Revisiting AMPA Receptors as an AntiEpileptic Drug Target” Epilepsy Currents 11.2 (2011).) However, certain anticonvulsant agents such as Talampanel ((8R)-7-Acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine), selurampanel (BGG492) (N-[7-isopropyl-6-(2-methyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl)-2,4-dioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-qui-nazolin-3-yl]methanesulfonamide), and perampanel (5'-(2-cyanophenyl)-1'-phenyl-2,3'-bipyridinyl-6'(1'H)-one) are general (non-TARP dependent/non-selective) AMPA receptor antagonists. However, such general antagonism affects most areas of the CNS resulting in undesired effects,
Glutamate as an excitatory neurotransmitter has been known to induce neurotoxicity by, for example, abnormal excitation of central nerves. Neurotoxicity is an adverse structural or functional change in the nervous system, and can take the form of subtle or gross biochemical changes, axonal degeneration, dendritic pruning or sprouting, loss or rearrangement of synapses, or cell death. Numerous nervous diseases involve a neurotoxic component, including and not limited to cerebral ischemia, head injury, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington's chorea, AIDS nervous disturbance, epilepsy, mental disorder, mobility disturbance, pain, spasticity, nervous disturbance by toxin in food, various neurodegenerative diseases, various mental diseases, chronic pain, migraine, cancer pain and diabetic neuropathy.
Substances showing an antagonistic action to excitatory neurotransmitter receptors are potentially useful for the treatment of the above-mentioned conditions. For example, WO2000001376 suggests that inhibitors of the interaction of glutamate with the AMPA and/or kainate receptor complex could be useful in treating demyelinating disorders such as encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain Barre syndrome), chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Marchifava-Bignami disease, central pontine myelinolysis, Devic syndrome, Balo disease, HIV- or HTLV-myelopathy, progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, a secondary demyelinating disorder; for example, CNS lupus erythematodes, polyarteritis nodosa, Sjogren syndrome, sarcoidosis, isolated cerebral vasculitis, etc.
Hippocampus links the limbic system to frontal cortex, thereby linking emotion to cognition (Small et al, Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 12:585-601, 2011). A meta-analysis of post-mortem neuro-pathology studies suggests that hippocampal volume is reduced in volume in patients with mood disorders (Harrison, Brain 125:1428-1449, 2002). Hippocampal neurons are particularly susceptible to stress-related atrophy. Pathological states characterized by excessive activity within hippocampus may be improved by a therapeutic intervention that selectively reduces hippocampal excitability. Modulation of neuronal excitability within hippocampus may provide a therapeutic benefit in mood disorders.
Excess activity in hippocampus has been observed in response to emotionally-charged stimuli in bipolar patients compared to controls (reviewed by Chen et al., Bipolar Disord., 13:1-15, 2011). Chronic treatment with mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproate reduced AMPA receptor surface expression in hippocampus (Du et al., J Neurosci 28: 68-79, 2008). Tricyclic antidepressants can trigger mania in bipolar patients (Nolen and Bloemkolk, Neuropsychobiology, 42 Suppl 1:11-7, 2000); these treatments can increase AMPA receptor surface expression in hippocampus (Du et al., J Neurosci 24: 6578-6589, 2004.)
In Gray's Neuropsychological Theory of Anxiety (2003), septum and hippocampus form a ‘behavioral inhibition system’ activated during anxiety-provoking conflict situations. A corollary of this theory is that anxiolytic drugs act by suppressing this ‘behavioral inhibition system’. Indeed, intrahippocampal micro-infusion of GABAA agonists is sufficient to replicate their anxiolytic effects (Engin and Treit, Behav Pharmacol 18:365-374, 2007). Traditional anxiolytics with a variety of mechanisms-of-action, including GABAA-receptor antagonists, 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, and SSRIs, suppress brainstem-stimulated theta rhythm within hippocampus (McNaughton et al., Behav Pharmacol 18: 329-346, 2007). Direct injection of inhibitors of neuronal excitability into rodent hippocampus was shown to reduce the hippocampal theta rhythm, and to produce an anxiolytic phenotype. Intrahippocampal administration of ZD7288, an HCN channel inhibitor, slowed brainstem-stimulated theta rhythm in anesthetized rat and also increased the amount of time that rats spent in the open arms of an elevated plus maze (Yeung et al., Hippocampus 23:278-286, 2013). Intrahippocampal administration of phenytoin, a voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor and anticonvulsant, showed similar effects on brainstem-stimulated theta rhythm frequency in anesthetized rat and was anxiolytic in conscious rat (Yeung et al., Neuropharmacology 62: 155-160, 2012).
Hippocampal overactivity has been observed in patients suffering from schizophrenia (Heckers and Konradi, Curr Top Behav Neurosci. 4:529-553, 2010). The degree of hyperactivity was be positively correlated to the severity of the symptoms (Tregellas et al., Am J Psychiatry 171: 549-556, 2014). Hypermetabolism in hippocampus (esp. CA1 region) correlates with disease progression in at-risk individuals, and with disease severity in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (Schobel et al., Arch Gen Psych, 66:938-946, 2009). This over-activity, combined with the sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to excitotoxic damage, may lead to the observed decrease in hippocampal volume in schizophrenic patients. Neuroprotection in prodromal and early stages may prevent progressive damage (Kaur and Cadenhead, Curr Top Behav Neurosci, 2010).
In view of the clinical importance of AMPA receptors, the identification of compounds that modulate AMPA receptor function represents an attractive avenue into the development of new therapeutic agents. Such compounds are provided herein.

The AMPA subtype of glutamate receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels expressed primarily on postsynaptic membranes of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. AMPA receptors assemble as tetramers of subunits. Mammals express four AMPA-receptor subunits, called GluA1-GluA4. In their native environment, the pore-forming GluA tetramers directly or indirectly associate with numerous auxiliary proteins. The wide variety of proteins which can participate in AMPA receptor complexes vastly increases the ability of a neuron to tune the response characteristics of its synapses.
AMPA receptors mediate the majority of fast neurotransmission across synaptic gaps. However, since AMPA receptor activity is so ubiquitous within CNS, general antagonism affects most areas of the CNS resulting in undesired effects, such as ataxia, sedation, and/or dizziness, which are shared by all known general AMPA receptor antagonists.
In order to circumvent the problems with side-effects noted above, it is hereby proposed that selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes provides effective therapeutic agents which also avoid or reduce the side-effects associated with the administration of non-selective AMPA receptor modulators. TARP γ8 is primarily expressed in the hippocampus and the cortex, while TARP γ2 is primarily expressed in the cerebellum. In one aspect, selective modulation of TARP γ8 potentially avoids modulation of TARP γ2-associated AMPA receptor complexes, which are more prevalent in the cerebellum, thereby reducing side effects associated with general (non-TARP dependent/non-selective) AMPA antagonism.
For instance, selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes is contemplated as an effective anti-seizure/anti-epileptic therapeutic with reduced the side effects (e.g. sedation, ataxis, and/or dizziness) associated with general (non-TARP dependent/non-selective) AMPA antagonists. Similarly, reduction of hippocampal over-excitability, using selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes may lead to normalization of the symptoms of schizophrenia, and it may protect against the subsequent decline in hippocampal volume. In a further instance, selectively attenuating hippocampal excitability, via selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes, could provide therapeutic benefit to patients with bipolar disorder. Likewise, selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes within the hippocampus may provide an effective anxiolytic.
Accordingly, provided herein are compounds which are selective modulators of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes. Compounds which are selective modulators of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes ameliorate and/or eliminate the side effects (e.g. sedation, ataxis, and/or dizziness) of general (non-TARP dependent/non-selective) AMPA receptor modulators.
In some embodiments, provided herein are compounds which selectively modulate the activity of complexes comprising GluA1 receptors associated with the protein TARP γ8.
In one embodiment, selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes refers to selective antagonism of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes. In another embodiment, selective modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes refers to selective partial inhibition of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes. In a further embodiment, selective antagonism of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes refers to negative allosteric modulation of TARP γ8-associated AMPA receptor complexes.
The invention relates to methods of using the compounds described herein to treat subjects diagnosed with or suffering from a disease, disorder, or condition mediated by AMPA receptor activity. These methods are accomplished by administering to the subject a compound of the invention. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are selective for modulation of TARP γ8 associated AMPA receptor complexes.

Additional embodiments, features, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description and through practice of the invention.
The invention may be more fully appreciated by reference to the following description, including the following glossary of terms and the concluding examples. For the sake of brevity, the disclosures of the publications, including patents, cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference.
Certain Definitions
As used herein, the terms “including”, “containing” and “comprising” are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense.
The term “alkyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. In some embodiments, an alkyl group is a C1-C6alkyl group. In some embodiments, an alkyl group is a C1-C4alkyl group. Examples of alkyl groups include methyl (Me) ethyl (Et), n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl (tBu), pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples.
The term “haloalkyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain and having at least one of the hydrogens replaced with a halogen. In some embodiments, a haloalkyl group is a C1-C6haloalkyl group. In some embodiments, a haloalkyl group is a C1-C4haloalkyl group. One exemplary substitutent is fluoro. Preferred substituted alkyl groups of the invention include trihalogenated alkyl groups such as trifluoromethyl groups. Haloalkyl includes and is not limited to -CF3, -CH2F, -CHF2, -CH2Cl, -CH2-CF3, and the like.
The term “cycloalkyl” refers to monocyclic, non-aromatic hydrocarbon groups having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like.
The term “halogen” represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine, or iodine. The term “halo” represents chloro, fluoro, bromo, or iodo.
The term “substituted” means that the specified group or moiety bears one or more substituents. The term “unsubstituted” means that the specified group bears no substituents. The term “optionally substituted” means that the specified group is unsubstituted or substituted by one or more substituents. Where the term “substituted” is used to describe a structural system, the substitution is meant to occur at any valency-allowed position on the system. In cases where a specified moiety or group is not expressly noted as being optionally substituted or substituted with any specified substituent, it is understood that such a moiety or group is intended to be unsubstituted.
The terms “para”, “meta”, and “ortho” have the meanings as understood in the art. Thus, for example, a fully substituted phenyl group has substituents at both “ortho” (o) positions adjacent to the point of attachment of the phenyl ring, both “meta” (m) positions, and the one “para” (p) position across from the point of attachment. To further clarify the position of substituents on the phenyl ring, the 2 different ortho positions will be designated as ortho and ortho' and the 2 different meta positions as meta and meta' as illustrated below.
<img> id-US20180111942A1-20180426-C00022.TIF </img>
When referring to substituents on a pyridyl group, the terms “para”, “meta”, and “ortho” refer to the placement of a substituent relative to the point of attachment of the pyridyl ring. For example the structure below is described as 3-pyridyl with the X1 substituent in the ortho position, the X2 substituent in the meta position, and X3 substituent in the para position:
<img> id-US20180111942A1-20180426-C00023.TIF </img>
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term “about”. It is understood that, whether the term “about” is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation to such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and approximations due to the experimental and/or measurement conditions for such given value. Whenever a yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers to a mass of the entity for which the yield is given with respect to the maximum amount of the same entity that could be obtained under the particular stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations that are given as percentages refer to mass ratios, unless indicated differently.
The terms “buffered” solution or “buffer” solution are used herein interchangeably according to their standard meaning. Buffered solutions are used to control the pH of a medium, and their choice, use, and function is known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See, for example, G. D. Considine, ed., Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry, p. 261, 5th ed. (2005), describing, inter alia, buffer solutions and how the concentrations of the buffer constituents relate to the pH of the buffer. For example, a buffered solution is obtained by adding MgSO4 and NaHCO3 to a solution in a 10:1 w/w ratio to maintain the pH of the solution at about 7.5.
Any formula given herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the formula. Thus, any formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers.
It is also to be understood that compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers.”
Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers.” When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, and a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+)- or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either an individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture.”
“Tautomers” refer to compounds that are interchangeable forms of a particular compound structure, and that vary in the displacement of hydrogen atoms and electrons. Thus, two structures may be in equilibrium through the movement of π electrons and an atom (usually H). For example, enols and ketones are tautomers because they are rapidly interconverted by treatment with either acid or base. Another example of tautomerism is the aci- and nitro-forms of phenyl nitromethane, that are likewise formed by treatment with acid or base.
Tautomeric forms may be relevant to the attainment of the optimal chemical reactivity and biological activity of a compound of interest.
Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art.

Additionally, any formula given herein is intended to refer also to hydrates, solvates, and polymorphs of such compounds, and mixtures thereof, even if such forms are not listed explicitly.
Certain compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) may be obtained as solvates. Solvates include those formed from the interaction or complexation of compounds of the invention with one or more solvents, either in solution or as a solid or crystalline form. In some embodiments, the solvent is water and the solvates are hydrates. In addition, certain crystalline forms of compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) may be obtained as co-crystals. In certain embodiments of the invention, compounds of Formula (I) were obtained in a crystalline form. In other embodiments, crystalline forms of compounds of Formula (I) were cubic in nature. In other embodiments, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) were obtained in a crystalline form. In still other embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) were obtained in one of several polymorphic forms, as a mixture of crystalline forms, as a polymorphic form, or as an amorphous form. In other embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) convert in solution between one or more crystalline forms and/or polymorphic forms.
Reference to a compound herein stands for a reference to any one of: (a) the actually recited form of such compound, and (b) any of the forms of such compound in the medium in which the compound is being considered when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-COOH, encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH(s), R-COOH(sol), and R-COO−(sol). In this example, R-COOH(s) refers to the solid compound, as it could be for example in a tablet or some other solid pharmaceutical composition or preparation; R-COOH(sol) refers to the undissociated form of the compound in a solvent; and R-COO−(sol) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a solvent, such as the dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous environment, whether such dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt thereof, or from any other entity that yields R-COO− upon dissociation in the medium being considered. In another example, an expression such as “exposing an entity to compound of formula R-COOH” refers to the exposure of such entity to the form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such exposure takes place. In still another example, an expression such as “reacting an entity with a compound of formula R-COOH” refers to the reacting of (a) such entity in the chemically relevant form, or forms, of such entity that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such reacting takes place, with (b) the chemically relevant form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such reacting takes place. In this regard, if such entity is for example in an aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-COOH is in such same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to species such as R-COOH(aq) and/or R-COO−(aq), where the subscript “(aq)” stands for “aqueous” according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and biochemistry. A carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these nomenclature examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it is merely an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be provided in terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl, basic nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that interacts or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains the compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis, solvation, including hydration, protonation, and deprotonation. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art.
In another example, a zwitterionic compound is encompassed herein by referring to a compound that is known to form a zwitterion, even if it is not explicitly named in its zwitterionic form. Terms such as zwitterion, zwitterions, and their synonyms zwitterionic compound(s) are standard IUPAC-endorsed names that are well known and part of standard sets of defined scientific names. In this regard, the name zwitterion is assigned the name identification CHEBI:27369 by the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) dictionary of molecular entities. As generally well known, a zwitterion or zwitterionic compound is a neutral compound that has formal unit charges of opposite sign. Sometimes these compounds are referred to by the term “inner salts”. Other sources refer to these compounds as “dipolar ions”, although the latter term is regarded by still other sources as a misnomer. As a specific example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine) has the formula H2NCH2COOH, and it exists in some media (in this case in neutral media) in the form of the zwitterion +H3NCH2COO−. Zwitterions, zwitterionic compounds, inner salts and dipolar ions in the known and well established meanings of these terms are within the scope of this invention, as would in any case be so appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. Because there is no need to name each and every embodiment that would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, no structures of the zwitterionic compounds that are associated with the compounds of this invention are given explicitly herein. They are, however, part of the embodiments of this invention. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because the interactions and transformations in a given medium that lead to the various forms of a given compound are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art.
Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine such as 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 125I, respectively. Such isotopically labeled compounds are useful in metabolic studies (preferably with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H), detection or imaging techniques [such as positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)] including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays, or in radioactive treatment of patients. In particular, an 18F or 11C labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET or SPECT studies. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium or tritium (i.e., 2H, 3H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements. Isotopically labeled compounds of this invention and prodrugs thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent.
When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the same choice of the species for the variable appearing elsewhere. In other words, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of the species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula, unless stated otherwise.
According to the foregoing interpretive considerations on assignments and nomenclature, it is understood that explicit reference herein to a set implies, where chemically meaningful and unless indicated otherwise, independent reference to embodiments of such set, and reference to each and every one of the possible embodiments of subsets of the set referred to explicitly.
By way of a first example on substituent terminology, if substituent S1example is one of S1 and S2, and substituent S2example is one of S3 and S4, then these assignments refer to embodiments of this invention given according to the choices S1example is S1 and S2example is S3; S1example is S1 and S2example is S4; S1example is S2 and S2example is S3; S1example is S2 and S2example is S4; and equivalents of each one of such choices. The shorter terminology “S1example is one of S1 and S2, and S2example is one of S3 and S4” is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing first example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R1, R2, R3, R4, R4a, R4b, R4c, R4d, R5, R6, R7, Hal, X, Y, Z1, and Z2, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.
Furthermore, when more than one assignment is given for any member or substituent, embodiments of this invention comprise the various groupings that can be made from the listed assignments, taken independently, and equivalents thereof. By way of a second example on substituent terminology, if it is herein described that substituent Sexample is one of S1, S2, and S3, this listing refers to embodiments of this invention for which Sexample is S1; Sexample is S2; Sexample is S3; Sexample is one of S1 and S2; Sexample is one of S1 and S3; Sexample is one of S2 and S3; Sexample is one of S1, S2 and S3; and Sexample is any equivalent of each one of these choices. The shorter terminology “Sexample is one of S1, S2, and S3” is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing second example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such R1, R2, R3, R4, R4a, R4b, R4c, R4d, R5, R6, R7, Hal, X, Y, Z1, and Z2, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.
The nomenclature “Ci-j” with j>i, when applied herein to a class of substituents, is meant to refer to embodiments of this invention for which each and every one of the number of carbon members, from i to j including i and j, is independently realized. By way of example, the term C1-3 refers independently to embodiments that have one carbon member (C1), embodiments that have two carbon members (C2), and embodiments that have three carbon members (C3).
The term Cn-malkyl refers to an aliphatic chain, whether straight or branched, with a total number N of carbon members in the chain that satisfies n≤N≤m, with m>n. Any disubstituent referred to herein is meant to encompass the various attachment possibilities when more than one of such possibilities are allowed. For example, reference to disubstituent -A-B-, where A≠B, refers herein to such disubstituent with A attached to a first substituted member and B attached to a second substituted member, and it also refers to such disubstituent with A attached to the second substituted member and B attached to the first substituted member.
The invention includes also pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)), preferably of those described above and of the specific compounds exemplified herein, and methods of treatment using such salts.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or the corresponding agency in countries other than the United States, or that is listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly, in humans.
A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of compounds represented by Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) that are non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. It should possess the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound. See, generally, G. S. Paulekuhn, et al., “Trends in Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient Salt Selection based on Analysis of the Orange Book Database”, J. Med. Chem., 2007, 50:6665-72, S. M. Berge, et al., “Pharmaceutical Salts”, J Pharm Sci., 1977, 66:1-19, and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts, Properties, Selection, and Use, Stahl and Wermuth, Eds., Wiley-VCH and VHCA, Zurich, 2002. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include sulfates, pyrosulfates, bisulfates, sulfites, bisulfites, phosphates, monohydrogen-phosphates, dihydrogenphosphates, metaphosphates, pyrophosphates, chlorides, bromides, iodides, acetates, propionates, decanoates, caprylates, acrylates, formates, isobutyrates, caproates, heptanoates, propiolates, oxalates, malonates, succinates, suberates, sebacates, fumarates, maleates, butyne-1,4-dioates, hexyne-1,6-dioates, benzoates, chlorobenzoates, methylbenzoates, dinitrobenzoates, hydroxybenzoates, methoxybenzoates, phthalates, sulfonates, xylenesulfonates, phenylacetates, phenylpropionates, phenylbutyrates, citrates, lactates, γ-hydroxybutyrates, glycolates, tartrates, methane-sulfonates, propanesulfonates, naphthalene-1-sulfonates, naphthalene-2-sulfonates, and mandelates.
When the compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) contain a basic nitrogen, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method available in the art. For example, treatment of the free base with an inorganic acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, nitric acid, boric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like, or with an organic acid, such as acetic acid, phenylacetic acid, propionic acid, stearic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, isethionic acid, succinic acid, valeric acid, fumaric acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, glycolic acid, salicylic acid, oleic acid, palmitic acid, lauric acid, a pyranosidyl acid, such as glucuronic acid or galacturonic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid, such as mandelic acid, citric acid, or tartaric acid, an amino acid, such as aspartic acid, glutaric acid or glutamic acid, an aromatic acid, such as benzoic acid, 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, naphthoic acid, or cinnamic acid, a sulfonic acid, such as laurylsulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, any compatible mixture of acids such as those given as examples herein, and any other acid and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology.
When the compound of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) is an acid, such as a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid, the desired pharmaceutically acceptable salt may be prepared by any suitable method, for example, treatment of the free acid with an inorganic or organic base, such as an amine (primary, secondary or tertiary), an alkali metal hydroxide, alkaline earth metal hydroxide, any compatible mixture of bases such as those given as examples herein, and any other base and mixture thereof that are regarded as equivalents or acceptable substitutes in light of the ordinary level of skill in this technology. Illustrative examples of suitable salts include organic salts derived from amino acids, such as N-methyl-D-glucamine, lysine, choline, glycine and arginine, ammonia, carbonates, bicarbonates, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, and cyclic amines, such as tromethamine, benzylamines, pyrrolidines, piperidine, morpholine, and piperazine, and inorganic salts derived from sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, aluminum, and lithium.
The invention also relates to pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)), and treatment methods employing such pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs. The term “prodrug” means a precursor of a designated compound that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via a chemical or physiological process such as solvolysis or enzymatic cleavage, or under physiological conditions (e.g., a prodrug on being brought to physiological pH is converted to the compound of Formula (I) A “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” is a prodrug that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. Illustrative procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs”, ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.
Exemplary prodrugs include compounds having an amino acid residue, or a polypeptide chain of two or more (e.g., two, three or four) amino acid residues, covalently joined through an amide or ester bond to a free amino, hydroxyl, or carboxylic acid group of a compound of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)). Examples of amino acid residues include the twenty naturally occurring amino acids, commonly designated by three letter symbols, as well as 4-hydroxyproline, hydroxylysine, demosine, isodemosine, 3-methylhistidine, norvalin, beta-alanine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, citrulline homocysteine, homoserine, ornithine and methionine sulfone.
Additional types of prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) as amides or alkyl esters. Examples of amides include those derived from ammonia, primary C1-6alkyl amines and secondary di(C1-6alkyl) amines. Secondary amines include 5- or 6-membered heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl ring moieties. Examples of amides include those that are derived from ammonia, C1-3alkyl primary amines, and di(C1-2alkyl)amines. Examples of esters of the invention include C1-7alkyl, C5-7cycloalkyl, phenyl, and phenyl(C1-6alkyl) esters. Preferred esters include methyl esters. Prodrugs may also be prepared by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in Fleisher et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 115-130. Carbamate derivatives of hydroxy and amino groups may also yield prodrugs. Carbonate derivatives, sulfonate esters, and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups may also provide prodrugs. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethyl ethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester, optionally substituted with one or more ether, amine, or carboxylic acid functionalities, or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester as described above, is also useful to yield prodrugs. Prodrugs of this type may be prepared as described in Robinson et al., J Med Chem. 1996, 39 (1), 10-18. Free amines can also be derivatized as amides, sulfonamides or phosphonamides. All of these prodrug moieties may incorporate groups including ether, amine, and carboxylic acid functionalities.
The present invention also relates to pharmaceutically active metabolites of the compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)), which may also be used in the methods of the invention. A “pharmaceutically active metabolite” means a pharmacologically active product of metabolism in the body of a compound of Formula (I) or salt thereof. Prodrugs and active metabolites of a compound may be determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. See, e.g., Bertolini, et al., J Med Chem. 1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan, et al., J Pharm Sci. 1997, 86 (7), 765-767; Bagshawe, Drug Dev Res. 1995, 34, 220-230; Bodor, Adv Drug Res. 1984, 13, 224-331; Bundgaard, Design of Prodrugs (Elsevier Press, 1985); and Larsen, Design and Application of Prodrugs, Drug Design and Development (Krogsgaard-Larsen, et al., eds., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991).
The compounds of Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs, and pharmaceutically active metabolites of the present invention are useful as modulators of the AMPA receptor in the methods of the invention. As such modulators, the compounds may act as antagonists, agonists, or inverse agonists. The term “modulators” include both inhibitors and activators, where “inhibitors” refer to compounds that decrease, prevent, inactivate, desensitize, or down-regulate the AMPA receptor expression or activity, and “activators” are compounds that increase, activate, facilitate, sensitize, or up-regulate AMPA receptor expression or activity.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient or carrier with which a compound of the invention is administered. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a substance that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluent to facilitate administration of a agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols.
The term “subject” includes humans. The terms “human,” “patient,” and “subject” are used interchangeably herein.
The term “treating” or “treatment” of any disease or disorder refers, in one embodiment, to ameliorating the disease or disorder (i.e., arresting or reducing the development of the disease or at least one of the clinical symptoms thereof). In another embodiment “treating” or “treatment” refers to ameliorating at least one physical parameter, which may not be discernible by the subject. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to modulating the disease or disorder, either physically, (e.g., stabilization of a discernible symptom), physiologically, (e.g., stabilization of a physical parameter), or both. In yet another embodiment, “treating” or “treatment” refers to delaying the onset of the disease or disorder.
In treatment methods according to the invention, a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is administered to a subject suffering from or diagnosed as having such a disease, disorder, or condition. A “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount or dose sufficient to generally bring about the desired therapeutic or prophylactic benefit in patients in need of such treatment for the designated disease, disorder, or condition. Effective amounts or doses of the compounds of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the compound, the severity and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. An example of a dose is in the range of from about 0.001 to about 200 mg of compound per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable dosage amount is from about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, or about 10 mg to about 2.5 g/day.
“Compounds of the present invention,” and equivalent expressions, are meant to embrace compounds of the Formula (I) (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)) as described herein, which expression includes the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the solvates, e.g., hydrates, where the context so permits. Similarly, reference to intermediates, whether or not they themselves are claimed, is meant to embrace their salts, and solvates, where the context so permits.
Once improvement of the patient's disease, disorder, or condition has occurred, the dose may be adjusted for preventative or maintenance treatment. For example, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, may be reduced as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect is maintained. Of course, if symptoms have been alleviated to an appropriate level, treatment may cease. Patients may, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.
In addition, the compounds of the invention may be used in combination with additional active ingredients in the treatment of the above conditions. The additional active ingredients may be coadministered separately with a compound of the invention or included with such an agent in a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention. In an exemplary embodiment, additional active ingredients are those that are known or discovered to be effective in the treatment of conditions, disorders, or diseases mediated by orexin activity, such as another orexin modulator or a compound active against another target associated with the particular condition, disorder, or disease. The combination may serve to increase efficacy (e.g., by including in the combination a compound potentiating the potency or effectiveness of an active agent according to the invention), decrease one or more side effects, or decrease the required dose of the active agent according to the invention.
The compounds of the invention are used, alone or in combination with one or more additional active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention comprises: (a) an effective amount of at least one compound in accordance with the invention; and (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
Delivery forms of the pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more dosage units of the active agents may be prepared using suitable pharmaceutical excipients and compounding techniques known or that become available to those skilled in the art. The compositions may be administered in the inventive methods by a suitable route of delivery, e.g., oral, parenteral, rectal, topical, or ocular routes, or by inhalation.
The preparation may be in the form of tablets, capsules, sachets, dragees, powders, granules, lozenges, powders for reconstitution, liquid preparations, or suppositories. Preferably, the compositions are formulated for intravenous infusion, topical administration, or oral administration.
For oral administration, the compounds of the invention can be provided in the form of tablets or capsules, or as a solution, emulsion, or suspension. To prepare the oral compositions, the compounds may be formulated to yield a dosage of, e.g., from about 0.05 to about 100 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.05 to about 35 mg/kg daily, or from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg daily. For example, a total daily dosage of about 5 mg to 5 g daily may be accomplished by dosing once, twice, three, or four times per day.
Oral tablets may include a compound according to the invention mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients such as inert diluents, disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preservative agents. Suitable inert fillers include sodium and calcium carbonate, sodium and calcium phosphate, lactose, starch, sugar, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol, and the like. Exemplary liquid oral excipients include ethanol, glycerol, water, and the like. Starch, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP), sodium starch glycolate, microcrystalline cellulose, and alginic acid are suitable disintegrating agents. Binding agents may include starch and gelatin. The lubricating agent, if present, may be magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. If desired, the tablets may be coated with a material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate to delay absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, or may be coated with an enteric coating.
Capsules for oral administration include hard and soft gelatin capsules. To prepare hard gelatin capsules, compounds of the invention may be mixed with a solid, semi-solid, or liquid diluent. Soft gelatin capsules may be prepared by mixing the compound of the invention with water, an oil such as peanut oil or olive oil, liquid paraffin, a mixture of mono and di-glycerides of short chain fatty acids, polyethylene glycol 400, or propylene glycol.
Liquids for oral administration may be in the form of suspensions, solutions, emulsions or syrups or may be lyophilized or presented as a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid compositions may optionally contain: pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients such as suspending agents (for example, sorbitol, methyl cellulose, sodium alginate, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, aluminum stearate gel and the like); non-aqueous vehicles, e.g., oil (for example, almond oil or fractionated coconut oil), propylene glycol, ethyl alcohol, or water; preservatives (for example, methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate or sorbic acid); wetting agents such as lecithin; and, if desired, flavoring or coloring agents.
The active agents of this invention may also be administered by non-oral routes. For example, the compositions may be formulated for rectal administration as a suppository. For parenteral use, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous routes, the compounds of the invention may be provided in sterile aqueous solutions or suspensions, buffered to an appropriate pH and isotonicity or in parenterally acceptable oil. Suitable aqueous vehicles include Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride. Such forms will be presented in unit-dose form such as ampules or disposable injection devices, in multi-dose forms such as vials from which the appropriate dose may be withdrawn, or in a solid form or pre-concentrate that can be used to prepare an injectable formulation. Illustrative infusion doses may range from about 1 to 1000 .mu·g/kg/minute of compound, admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier over a period ranging from several minutes to several days.
For topical administration, the compounds may be mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier at a concentration of about 0.1% to about 10% of drug to vehicle. Another mode of administering the compounds of the invention may utilize a patch formulation to affect transdermal delivery. Compounds of the invention may alternatively be administered in methods of this invention by inhalation, via the nasal or oral routes, e.g., in a spray formulation also containing a suitable carrier.
Exemplary compounds useful in methods of the invention will now be described by reference to the illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to Formula (I), (as well as Formulas (IA), (IB), and (IC)). Reactions may be performed between the melting point and the reflux temperature of the solvent, and preferably between 0° C. and the reflux temperature of the solvent. Reactions may be heated employing conventional heating or microwave heating. Reactions may also be conducted in sealed pressure vessels above the normal reflux temperature of the solvent.

Biological Assays
Calcium Flux Assay
This assay was used to test compounds for their ability to inhibit TARP γ8 dependent AMPA receptor activity. The AMPA receptor is a non-selective cation channel activated by glutamate. Ionotropic glutamate receptors normally desensitize too rapidly to allow detectable calcium influx in a FLIPR assay (Strange et al. (2006). “Functional characterisation of homomeric ionotropic glutamate receptors GluR1-GluR6 in a fluorescence-based high throughput screening assay.” Comb Chem High Throughput Screen 9(2): 147-158). But, this desensitization is incomplete, and a substantial steady-state current remains in the sustained presence of glutamate (Cho et al. (2007). “Two families of TARP isoforms that have distinct effects on the kinetic properties of AMPA receptors and synaptic currents.” Neuron 55(6): 890-904).
An in vitro assay was used to determine the potency of test compounds as inhibitors of the glutamate response of the channel formed by GluA1o-γ8. To ensure a 1:1 stoichiometry of GluA1o and γ8 subunits in the expressed channel, a fusion of the cDNAs for GRIA1o and CACNG8 was used. Following Shi et al (2009) “The stoichiometry of AMPA receptors and TARPs varies by neuronal cell type.” Neuron 62(5): 633-640), the C-terminus of the cDNA for GRIA1o was fused to the N-terminus of the cDNA for γ8. The linker sequence was QQQQQQQQQQEFAT. Channels expressed with this construct appear to have similar properties to channels formed by co-expression of GRIA1o with an excess of CACNG8 (Shi et al. 2009). A clonal cell line in HEK293 cells stably expressing this construct, with a geneticin selection marker, was generated for use in this assay.
Cell expressing the GRIA1o-CACNG8 fusion construct were grown in a monolayer in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates. They were washed with assay buffer (135 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 3 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mOs) using a Biotek EL405 plate washer. The cells were then loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye (Calcium-5 or Calcium-6, Molecular Devices) and the test compounds at a range of concentrations. Calcium flux following the addition of 15 μM glutamate was monitored using a Molecular Devices FLIPR Tetra.
The fluorescence in each well was normalized to the fluorescence of negative and positive control wells. The negative control wells had no added compounds, and the positive control wells had been incubated with 10 μM CP465022 (a non-subtype-selective AMPA receptor antagonist) (Lazzaro et al. (2002). “Functional characterization of CP-465,022, a selective, noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist.” Neuropharmacology 42(2): 143-153). The responses to glutamate as functions of the test compound concentrations were fitted to a four-parameter logistic function. The fitted parameter corresponding to the midpoint was taken to be the potency of inhibition of the compound. The data in Table 4 below illustrates the observed potency for the compounds described herein. pIC50 refers to the negative log of the IC50 in molar.
Using a similar protocol, compounds were also tested for their ability to inhibit TARP γ2 dependent AMPA receptor activity. The compounds that were tested for TARP γ2 AMPA receptor activity had pIC50 values less than 6.

Electrophysiology Assay
The effects of selected compounds upon endogenous gamma8-containing AMPA receptor currents are evaluated using whole-cell electrophysiology on acutely-dissociated mouse hippocampal neurons. Hippocampus was chosen for this assay, since CACNG8 (the protein encoded by this gene is a type I transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein i.e., TARP) is preferentially enriched in this brain region (Tomita et al. (2003). “Functional studies and distribution define a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins.” J Cell Biol 161(4): 805-816.2003). Hippocampi are dissected from C57black6 mice at 4-12 weeks postnatal, following the protocol described by Brewer (Brewer, G. J. (1997). “Isolation and culture of adult rat hippocampal neurons.” Journal of Neuroscience Methods 71(2): 143-155). The following is a brief summary of the procedure. Mice are asphyxiated with CO2 then decapitated. The brain is rapidly removed, then placed into ice-cold HABG medium. The recipe for HABG medium is: HibernateA supplemented with 2% B27 and 0.5 mM Glutamax (all reagents from Life Technologies). Hippocampi are micro-dissected from the brains, then washed with HABG without calcium (Hibernate A minus Calcium, BrainBits; 2% B27, Life Technologies; 0.5 mM glutamax, Life Technologies).
The hippocampi are then transferred to HABG without calcium, supplemented with 2 mg/mL papain (Worthington Biochemical). They are incubated at 30° C. on a roller for 40 min, then gently triturated with a fire-polished glass pipette. The supernatant containing dissociated neurons is collected, then centrifuged for 2 min at 200 g. The cell pellet is collected, and then resuspended in 8 mL of HABG. Live cells are counted, then plated onto 12 mm glass coverslips in 2 mL of HABG in 24-well plates at a density of 50-100 cells per coverslip. These cells are maintained at rt until use. Whole-cell electrophysiology is performed using 1.5 mm diameter glass capillary tubes (World Precision Instruments TW150-4), pulled to a fine tip with a Sutter P-97 micropipette puller. The intracellular buffer was 90 mM KF, 30 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, and 5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4, 290 mOs. The extracellular buffer was 135 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mOs. The open-tip resistances of the micropipettes using these solutions are 2-4 MΩ. Whole-cell recordings of neuron cell bodies are performed in voltage-clamp mode using an Axon Axopatch 200B amplifier. Whole-cell current is measured holding the interior of the cell at −60 mV, using a 5 kHz lowpass filter. The cells are continuously perfused through 7 mm square glass barrels using a solenoid-controlled solution switching device (Warner Instruments, PF-77B). The peak current in response to a 500 ms exposure to 10 mM glutamate every 5 seconds is measured, before and after exposure to test compound.
For analysis, the mean peak current of 5 traces in the presence of test compound is divided by the mean peak current of 5 traces prior to the addition of test compound. Compounds are tested at concentrations at least ten times higher than their estimated potency in the calcium flux assay, in order to ensure near-saturating occupancy of the receptor.
