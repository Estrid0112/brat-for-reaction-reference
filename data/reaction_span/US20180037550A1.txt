This invention is directed to prodrugs of an NMDA antagonist, (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, and their use in the treatment of depression and depressive disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD), and also for the treatment of pain (such as neuropathic pain). The prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine can also be used to treat Rett Syndrome, suicidal ideation, bipolar disorder (including bipolar depression), obsessive compulsive disorder, sarin gas poisoning, and status epilepticus. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the prodrugs and to processes for preparing them.
Pain in one form or another is a pervasive part of human life. Pain from injury and post-surgical pain is often temporary, but can be severe, and can persist. Neuropathic pain such as diabetic neuropathy and post-herpetic neuralgia severely impacts sufferers. Every year, tens of millions of people around the world, including patients at the end of their lives, suffer from pain without adequate treatment.
Depression affects about 120 million people worldwide. Symptoms of depression include, but are not limited to, depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration, or any combination thereof. These problems can be chronic or recurrent and can lead to substantial impairment of an individual's ability to take care of his or her everyday responsibilities. Depression is the leading cause of disability as measured by Years Lived with a Disability (YLDs) and the fourth leading contributor to the global burden of disease as measured by Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs; i.e., the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability) in 2000. By the year 2020, depression is projected to reach second place in the ranking of DALYs calculated for all ages, in both men and women. Today, depression is already the second cause of DALYs in the age category 15-44 years for both sexes combined.
(S)-1-Phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride has been disclosed for the treatment of MDD via intravenous infusion treatment (Gerard Sanacora et al, poster presented on 6 Dec. 2012 at the 51st Annual Meeting of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Hollywood, Fla., USA. Other related disclosures include WO1993/020052, WO2000/056324, and WO2000/63175. For convenience it would be useful to be able to administer this drug as an oral dosage form. However, a concern with such an oral dosage form of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride would be that it would be open to misuse intravenously, for example, tablet crushing of an oral dosage form of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride followed by immediate injection of the resulting crushed oral dosage form of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride. Prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine are predicted to break down in a human body to provide (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, so that, when prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine are administered orally, they would break down to liberate a therapeutically effective dose of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. But if a prodrug of the present invention is administered intravenously it is predicted that the prodrug would liberate (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine to give a lower Cmax, at a slower rate, than if the corresponding dose of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine had been administered intravenously. The use of prodrugs of (S)-1-Phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine would be predicted to improve the clinical safety profile of (S)-1-Phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine (for example under overdose or, drug abuse (eg pill crushing) conditions). Thus, in summary, putting (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethamamine directly into an oral formulation could lead to abuses. Compounds of the present invention metabolise in vivo to give (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethamamine, but at a slower rate than the rate when (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethamamine is administered intravenously, and therefore would not encourage potential abuse of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine.

Example 13
This example illustrates that different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, wherein R1 is C1-6 alkylC(O)O(C1-6 alkoxy), may be used to achieve differing rates of conversion (i.e., slow or rapid) to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine to ascertain a suitable PK profile. Hence, varying R1 to produce different prodrugs results in different pharmacokinetic profiles of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Further, this Example illustrates that there is no expected loss in oral exposure when a prodrug is converted to free base. Conversion of a prodrug wherein R1 is C1-6 alkylC(O)O(C1-6 alkoxy) to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is expected to occur via an initial enzymatic hydrolysis of a functional group, such as an ester, followed by a spontaneous conversion to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Enzymes involved are expected to be several non-specific, high capacity esterases, which can be shown by inhibiting the conversion with a non-selective esterase inhibitor but not inhibiting the conversion using selective inhibitors. Such esterases are expected to be distributed throughout the human body. Human Intestinal Fluid (HIF), human liver S9 fraction and human whole blood have been used to examine the pharmacokinetic properties of the prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as well as the formation rate and formation extent of the (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine in different bodily compartments. The formation rate of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine from different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine differs markedly in all tested assays, as shown in Table 1.

The in vitro results shown in Table 1 show that different pharmacokinetic plasma profiles of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine can be achieved by using different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Hence, selection of a particular prodrug will allow different pharmacokinetic profiles of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine to be achieved, that is, different prodrugs may be used to achieve a slow or rapid conversion to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Human Intestinal Fluids (HIF), Human Liver and Human Blood assays used to generate the results shown in Table 1 have been described in Malmborg J & Ploeger B A, J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods (2013) May-June 67(3) 203-13, which is incorporated by reference herein.
Example 14
This example illustrates that different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, wherein R1 is

may be used to achieve differing rates of conversion (i.e., slow or rapid) to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine to ascertain a suitable PK profile. Hence, varying R1 to produce different prodrugs results in different pharmacokinetic profiles of(S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Further, this Example illustrates that there is no expected loss in oral exposure when a prodrug is converted to free base.
Conversion of a prodrug to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine of a compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is:
<img> id-US20180037550A1-20180208-C00048.TIF </img>
is expected to occur via enzymatic hydrolysis at the proline C-terminus, releasing a dipeptide and (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. The enzyme involved is expected to be dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), which can be shown by inhibiting the conversion with a selective inhibitor of this enzyme. DPPIV is expected to be distributed throughout the human body. Human Intestinal Fluid (HIF), human liver S9 fraction and human whole blood have been used to examine the pharmacokinetic properties of prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as well as the formation rate and formation extent of the (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine in different bodily compartments. Caco-2 cells have been used to evaluate the permeability and absorption potential of the prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. The formation rate of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine from different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine differed in the tested assays, especially in human blood, as shown in Table 2. The differing permeability displayed by different prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine suggests that the systemic exposure of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine will vary depending on prodrug chosen.

The in vitro assays show that different pharmacokinetic plasma profiles of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine can be achieved by using different prodrugs. Hence, different pharmacokinetic profiles of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine can be achieved by use of different prodrugs.
Example 15
This example illustrates that oral doses of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine have a similar pharmacokinetic profile to an IV 1-hour infusion of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine.
Based on in vitro data, (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine (lanicemine) projects to have good oral bioavailability (>75%) in man, but a higher than acceptable Cmax when given as an intravenous bolus (relative to its safety profile as a 1-hr infusion). One selection criterion used to evaluate the utility and suitability of a prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine was the potential for the prodrug to preserve (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine's oral/1-hr iv infusion characteristics (e.g., Tmax, Cmax, AUC) while blunting the Cmax of the active moiety when the prodrug is administered directly into the blood stream thereby attenuating potential misuse (e.g. abuse liability) and/or Cmax driven safety concerns. As a means of identifying prodrugs with appropriate pharmacokinetic profiles in man, multi-compartmental, physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were constructed for both (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine and each prodrug under consideration. The PBPK models were validated using a set of known prodrugs for which human PK data was available (see Malmborg J & Ploeger B A, J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods (2013) May-June 67(3) 203-13, which is incorporated herein by reference). Rate constants used in the model were based on in vitro stability studies (i.e. human intestinal fluid, human blood, etc.) conducted with both prodrugs and (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine (example values shown in Tables 1 and 2).
Table 3 shows key pharmacokinetic predictions for Example 5-one of the DPPIV cleaved prodrugs. As exemplified in Table 3 Cmax exposure of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is predicted to increase by >2× when a given oral dose form is crushed and illicitly delivered as a bolus i.v. administration. In contrast, (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine released from an oral administered prodrug has a PK profile similar to a 1-hr infusion of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine with no Cmax doubling when given as a bolus i.v. Furthermore, because conversion to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is driven selectively by DPPIV, a DPPIV inhibitor can be used to stop conversion in case of purposeful or inadvertent misuse-an added safety feature embedded within the DPPIV prodrug design.
In Table 3 Compound 1 is (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. In Table 3 all doses are selected to contain equivalent amounts of Compound 1 [(S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine free base], i.e. each dose contains the same amount of Compound 1 within it and potentially available for release in the form of free base (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Thus, modeled Cmax concentrations of free base Compound 1 may be compared directly across different administrations of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine and prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, as shown within Table 3.

Example 16
This example illustrates that when doses of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride (Example 5) and (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride were administered to dogs, the risk of seizures, as represented by NOEL and LOEL, was less with the prodrug.
(S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride and vehicle were administered once per day via oral gavage (water). Formulations were prepared twice, once weekly. Dosing formulations were stored and refrigerated (2-8° C.) in amber glass containers until required for dosing. A range of concentrations of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dihydrochloride in vehicle were prepared in order to keep the dose volume for all doses (1 mL/kg). Individual doses were based on the most recent body weights of dogs used in the study.
A prodrug of(S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as fumarate salt (example 5) and vehicle were administered once per day for 14 days via oral gavage at approximately the same time each day (+1 hour), (vehicle is 0.3 M gluconic acid pH 3.0). A range of concentrations of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as fumarate salt in vehicle were prepared (for example 3, 10 and 30 mg/mL of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine) in order to keep the dose volume for all doses (2 mL/kg). The dosing formulations were warmed to room temperature by stirring for at least 30 minutes prior to dosing and continuously throughout the administration procedure. Individual doses were based on the most recent body weights of dogs used in the study.
Table 4 Compound 1 is (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Table 4 illustrates the highest blood levels in which seizures do not occur (No Observed Effect Limit, NOEL), and the lowest blood levels in which seizures occur (Lowest Observed Effect Limit, LOEL), following administration of Compound 1 dihydrochloride and following administration of a fumarate salt prodrug of Compound 1. In each case the highest blood concentration (Cmax) of free base (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is measured. In the first case, the free base (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is generated directly from Compound 1, administered as the dihydrochloride salt. In the second case, the free base (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine is generated via in vivo conversion from a prodrug of Compound 1, administered as the fumarate salt. The NOEL for seizures was higher when the prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as fumarate salt was administered compared to when (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as dihydrochloride salt was administered.

Example 17
This example illustrates that increasing doses of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, Example 5, produces less than proportional increases in the concentration of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine in human intestinal fluid, as illustrated in FIG. 1a and FIG. 1b. As a consequence, it makes it harder to get high concentrations of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine from administering a prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine relative to administering (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine directly, which is sought after for drug abuse. Without wishing to be bound by theory, prodrugs of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, wherein R1 is, are primarily cleaved by DPPIV. There is the potential for endogenous and/or exogenous modulation of DPPIV to impact the conversion of the prodrug to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine.
Stock solutions of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine (0.33, 1, 3 and 6 mmol/L) were prepared by adding a volume (8.25, 25, 75 and 150 μL) of 20 mmol/L solution of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine dissolved in DMSO, to FaSSIF-v2 (491.75, 475, 425 and 350 μL). Subsequently, 10 μL of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine stock solution was added to supernatant (90 μL HIF) in a glass vial, mixed for 1 min, and injected on the LC-UV system. The initial concentration in the incubations were 33, 100, 300 and 600 μmol/L and samples were taken at 5, 20, 35, 65 and 125 min from the start of the incubation. An incubation experiment with (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine μmol/L) was used as the standard sample (one-point-calibration) to determine the formation rate and concentration of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. Analysis was performed on a photodiode array detector (the analytical wavelength used was 261 nm) coupled to a Waters Acquity UPLC. The column used was a BEH C-18, 1.7 rpm, 2.1×50 mm ID held at 40° C. and using a 0.2 μm in-line pre-filter. The mobile phases used consisted of A: 0.03% TFA in H2O (v/v) and B: 0.03% TFA in acetonitrile (v/v). Example gradient: The initial 1% B was ramped to 95% B over 7 min and then kept at 95% B for 0.4 min at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The conversion rate from prodrug to (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine was determined by fitting the measured prodrug and (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine concentrations versus time.
Example 18
Consistent with the in vitro observations from Example 17, in vivo studies (Example 18 below) in rats illustrate that Cmax exposures of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine, as described above, increases less than proportionally upon the transition between therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses of a prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. The results of these in vivo studies are tabulated in Table 5.
52 male and 52 female rats were administered either (a) prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine as a fumarate salt in vehicle (0.3M Gluconic Acid, pH 3.0) or (b) vehicle (0.3M Gluconic Acid, pH 3.0) once per day for 14 days at approximately the same time each day (09:26+/−124 minutes). The doses (30, 100, and 300 mg/kg of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine) were administered in a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. After 14 days, blood samples were collected 24 hours post-dose from lateral tail vein in restrained animals. Blood samples were collected using 50 ul neutral Sarstedt Minivette POCT capillary tubes. The blood was then transferred to pre-chilled tubes containing ice cold sodium citrate, shaken 5-10 times by hand and frozen in dry ice within 10 seconds of collection. Whole blood samples were shipped frozen on dry ice to Covance Laboratories Inc. for analysis. Samples were analyzed for concentrations of prodrug of (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine and (S)-1-phenyl-2-(pyridin-2-yl)ethanamine. All analytical work was conducted by Covance Laboratories, Inc., Madison, Wis. using an LC/MS/MS analytical method developed and validated by that laboratory.
