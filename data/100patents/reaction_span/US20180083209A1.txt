Referring to Table 1, a low driving voltage, long life, and high efficiency were exhibited by Examples 1 to 4.
The compounds according to example embodiments of the present disclosure are amine compounds including a fluorenyl group and a triphenylsilyl group, and may provide devices with a low driving voltage, long life, and high efficiency.
An amine compound may be used as a hole transport material. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that an amine compound according to an embodiment may improve hole transport ability by introducing a fluorenyl group having high rigidity and improving stacking degree between molecules, which may help provide an organic electroluminescence device with a low driving voltage and high efficiency. In addition, the amine compound according to an embodiment introduces a triphenylsilyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that this may improve charge tolerance and extend device life.
Comparative Compound 1 includes a dimethyl fluorenyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compound provides a device having high efficiency but has decreased stacking degree between molecules when compared to the amine compound according to an embodiment, which may decrease device life.
Comparative Example 2 does not include a fluorenyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that hole transport ability and charge tolerance may be low. Comparative Example 2 had lower efficiency and shorter device life.
Comparative Example 3 does not include a triphenylsilyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that charge tolerance may be low. Comparative Example 3 had shorter device life.
The amine compound according to an example embodiment is Formula 1 where Ar is an unsubstituted phenyl group. By comparison, in Comparative Example 4, Ar includes a biphenyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compound has increased conjugation length (conjugation area). Comparative Example 4 exhibited lower efficiency.
Comparative Example 5 includes quaternary carbon instead of a triphenylsilyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that the quaternary carbon has very low charge tolerance and device life is rapidly reduced.
Comparative Example 6 includes a trimethylsilyl group instead of a triphenylsilyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compound has low charge tolerance and low stacking degree between molecules when compared to a triphenylsilyl group, which may lower efficiency and shorten device life.
Without being bound by theory, it is believed that Comparative Example 7 has decreased stacking degree even further when compared to Comparative Example 1, which may shorten device life.
Comparative Example 8 includes a dibenzofuranyl group instead of a fluorenyl group; without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compound has a lower HOMO energy level than the fluorenyl group, which may lower affect driving voltage and shorten device life.
From the results of Table 1, it can be found that an organic electroluminescence device including an amine compound according to an embodiment may attain a low driving voltage, long life, and increased efficiency at the same time.
By way of summation and review, as an organic electroluminescence device, for example, an organic device composed of a first electrode, a hole transport layer disposed on the first electrode, an emission layer disposed on the hole transport layer, an electron transport layer disposed on the emission layer, and a second electrode disposed on the electron transport layer may be formed. Holes are injected from the first electrode, and the injected holes move via the hole transport layer and injected into the emission layer. Meanwhile, electrons are injected from the second electrode, and the injected electrons move via the electron transport layer and injected into the emission layer. By recombining the injected holes and electrons into the emission layer, excitons are generated in the emission layer. An organic electroluminescence device emits light using light emitted during the transition of the excitons back to a ground state. The configuration of an organic electroluminescence device may be varied.
As described above, embodiments may provide an amine compound which is capable of being used as a material for a hole transport material, and an organic electroluminescence device including the same in a hole transport region.
