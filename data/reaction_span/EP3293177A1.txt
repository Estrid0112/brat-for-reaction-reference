FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention pertains to the field of pharmaceutical technology, and in particular to a kind of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising said tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
BACKGROUND
A protein tyrosine kinase is an enzyme which can transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a tyrosine residue located in protein substrates, the protein tyrosine kinase plays a role in normal cell growth. Many growth factor receptor proteins work via the protein tyrosine kinase and affect the signal via this process and then regulate cell growth, such as FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor), VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor). However, under certain conditions, these receptors mutate or overexpress and become abnormal, thereby causing uncontrolled cell proliferation, resulting in tumor growth, and eventually leading to a well-known disease, i.e., cancer. Growth factor receptor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors play a role in the treatment of cancer and other diseases characterized by uncontrolled or abnormal cell growth by inhibiting the above phosphorylation process.
Uncontrolled angiogenesis is a sign of cancer. In 1971, Dr. Judah Folkman raised that tumor growth depends on angiogenesis (see Folkman, New England Journal of Medicine, 285: 1182-86 (1971)). According to Dr. Judah Folkman, the tumor can only grow to a certain size without additional blood vessels to nourish the tumor. In his simplest expression, it is pointed out that once a tumor has "survived", each increase in the population of tumor cells must be carried out by the increase in the number of new capillaries that converge on the tumor. According to the current understanding, the tumor's "survival" refers to the anterior phase of tumor growth, where the tumor cells which have a volume of several cubes of millimeters and no more than several million cells can survive on the existing host microvasculature.
It has been shown that the tumor can be treated by inhibiting angiogenesis rather than inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells themselves. Angiogenesis has been associated with a large number of different types of cancer, which include solid tumors and blood-borne tumors. Solid tumors associated with angiogenesis include, but are not limited to rhabdomyosarcoma, retinoblastoma, ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma and osteosarcoma. Angiogenesis is associated with breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer. Angiogenesis is also associated with blood-borne tumors, such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and any one of various acute or chronic myeloid neoplasms, in which the presence of uncontrolled proliferation of white blood cells is usually accompanied by anemia, weakened blood clotting, and increased lymph nodes, liver and spleen, and it is believed that angiogenesis plays a role in bone marrow abnormalities, and the abnormalities cause leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.
Angiogenesis plays a major role in the metastasis of cancer, and if it is possible to inhibit or eliminate the activity of the blood vessel, it will not grow even if the tumor is present. In the disease state, the prevention of angiogenesis can reduce the damage caused by the invasion of the new microvascular system. Controlled therapy for a vasculogenic process may result in the removal or reduction of these diseases.
Wherein, the research that FGFR (fibroblast growth factor receptor), VEGFR (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor) and PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) inhibitors inhibit angiogenesis is more and more mature.

Definition and description
Unless otherwise indicated, the following terms and phrases as used herein are intended to have the following meanings. A particular term or phrase should not be considered as undefined or unclear without specific definition, but should be understood in their ordinary sense. When a trade name appears in the present invention, it is intended to refer to its corresponding product or its active ingredient.
C1-7 is selected from C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 and C7; 3-6 membered is selected from 3, 4, 5 and 6 membered.
As used herein, the term "therapeutically acceptable" refers to those compounds, materials, compositions and/or dosage forms which are suitable for use in contact with the tissue or organ of humans and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications within a range of reliable medical judgment, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is meant to include a salt of a compound of the invention which are prepared with relatively nontoxic acids or bases, depending on the particular substituents found on the compounds described herein. When compounds of the invention contain relatively acidic functionalities, base addition salts can be obtained by contacting the neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of the desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include inorganic acid salts including for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, bicarbonate, phosphoric acid, hydrogen phosphate, dihydrogen phosphate, sulfuric acid, bisulfate, hydroiodic acid, phosphorous acid and the like; organic acid salts including such as acetic acid, propionic acid, isobutyric acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, suberic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, mandelic acid, phthalic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid and methanesulfonic acid; salts of amino acids (such as arginine); and salts of organic acids such as glucuronic acid (see Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
The neutral forms of the compounds are preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and isolating the parent compounds in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" belong to derivatives of the compounds of the present invention, wherein, the parent compound is modified by forming an acid addition salt with an acid or forming a base addition salt with a base. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to inorganic or organic acid salts of bases such as amines, alkali or organic salts of acids such as carboxylic acids, and the like.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include conventional non-toxic salts or quaternary ammonium salts of parent compounds, such as salts formed by non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. Conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to salts derived from inorganic acids and organic acids, which are selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, ascorbic acid , benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, bicarbonate, carbonic acid, citric acid, edetic acid, ethane disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, fumaric acid, glucoheptose, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, glycolic acid, hydrobromic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydroiodide, hydroxyl, naphthalenol, isethionic acid, lactic acid, lactose, dodecyl sulfonate, maleic acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, nitric acid, oxalic acid, pamoic acid, pantothenic acid, phenylacetic acid, phosphoric acid, polygalacturonic acid, propionic acid, salicylic acid, stearic acid, calcium folinate, succinic acid, sulfamic acid, p-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, sulfuric acid, tannin, tartaric acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compounds containing acids or bases by conventional chemical methods. In general, such salts are prepared by reacting these compounds in the form of free acids or bases with a stoichiometric amount of a suitable base or acid in water or an organic solvent or a mixture of the two. In general, nonaqueous media such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred.
In addition to the form of the salt, the compounds provided by the present invention also may be in the form of prodrugs. The prodrugs of the compounds described herein readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. In addition, prodrugs can be converted to the compounds of the invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an in vivo environment.
Certain compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated forms as well as solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and are encompassed within the scope of the invention. Certain compounds of the invention may exist in multiple crystalline or amorphous forms.
Certain compounds of the invention possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds; the racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are encompassed within the scope of the invention.
The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, J. Chem. Ed. 1985, 62: 114-120. Solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter unless otherwise noted. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.
Compounds of the invention can exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (-)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.
Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers and D and L isomers can be prepared using chiral synthons, or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. If, for instance, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the invention is desired, it can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resulting diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group, such as an amino group, or an acidic functional group, such as a carboxyl group, diastereomeric salts can be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers thus formed by fractional crystallization or chromatographic means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished using chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).
The compounds of the present invention may contain non-natural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more atoms constituting the compound. For example, the compounds can be labeled with radioisotopes, such as tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or C-14 (14C). All isotopic compositions of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are included within the scope of the present invention.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any formulation or carrier medium that can deliver an effective amount of the active substance of the present invention without interfering with the biological activity of the active substance and that is non-toxic to the host or patient. Representative carriers include water, oils, both vegetable and mineral, cream bases, lotion bases, ointment bases and the like. These bases include suspending agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Their formulation is well known to those in the art of topical pharmaceuticals. Additional information concerning carriers can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005) which is incorporated herein by reference.
The term "excipient" generally refers to carriers, diluents and/or vehicles used in formulating drug compositions effective for the desired use.
For drugs or pharmacologically active agents, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to the amount of the drugs or agents, which is non-toxic but can achieve the desired effect. For oral dosage forms of the present invention, the "effective amount" of the active substance in the composition refers to the amount required to achieve the desired effect when used in combination with another active substance in the composition. The amount of the effective amount varies from person to person, depending on the age and general condition of the receptor and on the specific active substance. A suitable effective amount in the case may be determined by a person skilled in the art in accordance with routine testing.
The term "active ingredient" "therapeutic agent" "active substance" or "active agent" refers to a chemical entity which is effective in treating target disorder, disease or symptoms.
The term "substituted" refers to that any one or more of the hydrogen atoms on a particular atom is substituted with a substituent, including a variant of heavy hydrogen and hydrogen, as long as the valence of the particular atom is normal and the substituted compound is stable. When the substituent is a ketone group (i.e., = O), it means that two hydrogen atoms are substituted. Ketone substitutions do not occur on aromatic groups. The term "optionally substituted" refers to that it may be substituted or may not be substituted, unless otherwise specified, the kind and number of substituents may be arbitrarily when they are chemically achievable.
When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than once in the composition or structure of the compound, its definition in each case is independent. Thus, for example, if a group is substituted with 0-2 R, the group may optionally be substituted up to at least two R, and in each case R has a separate option. In addition, combinations of substituents and/or variants thereof are permissible only if such combination produces a stable compound.
When one of the variables is selected from a single bond, it indicates that the two groups to which they are attached are directly connected, for example, when L represents a single bond in A-L-Z, the structure is actually A-Z.
When a bond of a substituent may be cross-linked to two atoms on a ring, the substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When the listed substituents do not be specified which atom to pass through to the compounds included in the general formula but not specifically mentioned, such substituents may be bonded through any of their atoms. The combination of substituents and/or variants thereof is permissible only if such combination produces a stable compound.For example, the structural unit<img> id-imgb0483.tif </img>indicates that it may be substituted at any position on a cyclohexyl group or a cyclic diene.

The bridge ring is also included in the definition of the heterocycle. A bridge ring is formed when one or more atoms (i.e. C, O, N or S) are attached to two non-adjacent carbon atoms or nitrogen atoms. Preferred bridge rings include but are not limited to one carbon atom, two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, two nitrogen atoms and one carbon-nitrogen.

Experimental Example 3: Tumor growth inhibition (TGI) analysis
The evolution and growth trends of the tumor was evaluated by the relationship between tumor volume and time. The long axis (L) and short axis (W) of the subcutaneous tumor were measured twice a week by the caliper and the volume of the tumor (TV) was calculated by the formula ((LxW2) / 2). TGI was calculated by the difference between the median tumor volume of the mice in the solvent group and the median tumor volume of the mice in the drug group expressed as a percentage of the tumor volume in the solvent control group
Calculated by the following formula:<img> id-imgb0886.tif </img>% TGI=((intermediate tumor volume control−intermediate tumorvolumeadministration group)/intermediate tumor volume control group)×100%
The original statistical analysis was performed by repeated variance analysis, and then a multiple comparisons were performed using the Scheffe psot hoc test method. Individual solvent (0.5% methylcellulose + 0.2% Tween aqueous solution) was a negative control.
The experimental results were shown in Table 3.
