TECHNICAL FIELD
In at least one aspect, the present invention relates to compounds and methods for inhibiting histone deacetylase.
BACKGROUND
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) proteins are key enzymes involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Specifically, HDAC-mediated deacetylation of acetyllysine residues on nucleosomal histones leads to tight binding to genomic DNA, which affects accessibility and transcription.1-2 In addition, HDAC proteins influence protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, protein localization, and protein stability through deacetylation of non-histone substrates.3-4 The eighteen human HDAC proteins are divided into four classes according to their homology with yeast proteins, size, cellular localization, and number of catalytic active sites.5 Class III (SIRT1-7) HDAC proteins are NAD+-dependent. Classes I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), II (HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10), and IV (HDAC11) HDAC proteins are metal-dependent, and are the focus of this work.5
HDAC proteins regulate the expression of several cancer-related proteins involved in cell signaling, transcription, and tumor suppression through the deacetylation of nucleosomal histone proteins.6-7 Overexpression of HDAC proteins results in unregulated transcription and aberrant protein activity and function, which is linked to several diseases, including cancer.7 For example, HDAC1 was overexpressed in lung,8 breast,9 and colon cancers.10 HDAC2 was overexpressed in colorectal cancer.11 HDAC8 was highly expressed in neuroblastoma patients, leading to cancer progression and poor survival rates.12 In addition, selective inhibition of HDAC8 induced apoptosis in leukemia and T-cell lymphoma cell lines.13 Class II HDAC6 was overexpressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer.14-15 Overexpression of both HDAC6 and HDAC8 was linked to breast cancer metastasis and invasion.16
Due to their key role in cancer, several anti-cancer agents targeting HDAC proteins have been developed.17 HDAC inhibitors promoted apoptosis and reduced proliferation and migration through their effect on both histone and non-histone substrates.17-19 Several HDAC inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for treatment of cancer, and several others are in clinical trials.20 SAHA (suberoylamide hydroxamic acid, Vorinostat, Zolinza™), and Belinostat (PXD101, Belodaq™) are FDA-approved for treatment of T-cell lymphoma (FIG. 1),20-22 while Panobinostat (LBH-589, Farydak™) was approved for treatment of multiple myeloma (FIG. 1).23 SAHA is a nonselective inhibitor that targets most of the eleven metal-dependent HDAC isoforms.24 The nonselectivity of the FDA-approved drugs, including SAHA, might explain the side effects observed in the clinic, such as cardiac arrhythmia and thrombocytopenia.25-26 Moreover, the use of SAHA as a chemical tool to study the role of specific HDAC isoforms in cancer cell biology is limited due to its nonselectivity.
To overcome the limitations of nonselective drugs, several isoform selective HDAC inhibitors have been developed, with some in clinical trials. As illustrative examples, entinostat (MS-275, FIG. 1) is selective for HDAC1, 2, and 3,24, 27 whereas tubastatin (FIG. 1) is HDAC6-selective.28-29 Recently, several dual HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors have been reported, including BRD-73954 and valpropylhydroxamic acid (FIG. 1).30-31 HDAC inhibitors that target one or two HDAC isoforms will be valuable for development of new drugs with minimal side effects.32-35 In addition, recent reports suggested that inhibition of two HDAC isoforms is desirable by maintaining synergistic therapeutic effects in various cancers.30, 36-37 Related to this work, dual inhibition of HDAC6 and HDAC8 might have potential application in breast cancer angiogenesis and metastasis.13, 30 Moreover, selective HDAC inhibitors will be useful as chemical tools to study cancer-related HDAC cell biology.
To understand the structural requirements of HDAC inhibitors, SAHA analogs substituted have been synthesized in the linker region at carbon 2 (C2), carbon 3 (C3), or carbon 6 (C6) (FIG. 1).38-40 C2-hexyl SAHA (FIG. 1) showed HDAC6/8 dual selectivity over HDAC1, 2, and 3, with 0.6 and 2.0 μM potency against HDAC6 and HDAC8, respectively.41 Some of the C3-modified SAHA analogs displayed preference for HDAC6 over HDAC1 and 3,39 while some of the C6-modified SAHA analogs inhibited HDAC1 and 6 over HDAC3.40 In addition, SAHA analogs modified at the hydroxamic acid moiety had a preference for HDAC1.42
Accordingly, there is a need for additional SAHA analogs with improved histone deacetylase inhibition.
SUMMARY
Against the prior art background set forth above, SAHA analogs modified at the C4 position were synthesized and screened in vitro and in cellulo for their activity and selectivity. Several C4-modified SAHA analogs showed high selectivity towards HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3, with nanomolar potency against HDAC6 and HDAC8. Docking studies provided a structural rationale for the observed selectivity. These studies emphasize that modification of the SAHA linker can enhance isoform selectivity. In addition, the HDAC6/8 dual selective C4-SAHA analogs reported here have the potential to be useful pharmacological tools for biomedical research and lead compounds for anti-cancer drug development.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of C4-Modified SAHA Analogs.
Synthesis of the C4-SAHA analogs started with a cross metathesis reaction of methyl-4-pentenoate 2 with crotonaldehyde 3 using second generation Grubbs' catalyst to afford the α,β-unsaturated aldehyde 4 (Scheme 1). Different substituents were appended to 4 via 1,4-addition using organolithium cuprates, followed by Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction with benzyl phosphonoacetate 5 to give the unsaturated benzyl esters 6a-f. Reduction and hydrogenolysis of 6a-f gave free acids 7a-f, which were coupled with aniline to afford 8a-f. Finally, esters 8a-f were reacted with hydroxylamine to afford the C4-substituted SAHA derivatives 1a-f as racemic mixtures.
In Vitro Screening of C4-Modified SAHA Analogs.
SAHA analogs 1a-f were tested for global HDAC inhibition with HeLa cell lysates as the source of all HDAC proteins (Table 1). HDAC activity was measured using the commercially available HDAC-Glo™ I/II substrate (Promega). The results of the screening showed that all of the synthesized derivatives were less potent than SAHA (Table 1 and 2, and FIG. 5). The most potent derivative was C4-methyl SAHA (1a), which showed an IC50 value of 3.3 μM. Compared to the parent molecule SAHA, C4-methyl SAHA is 18-fold less potent, while the rest of the analogs showed 78- to 344-fold reduction in potency. Because HeLa cell lysates contain all HDAC isoforms, the poor potency of the C4-SAHA analogs suggests that they might be selective for specific isoforms.

To assess selectivity, an initial screen was performed with analogs 1a-f and the parent molecule SAHA at a single concentration against HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 using an ELISA-based HDAC activity assay.28 These select isoforms were chosen due to their high deacetylation activity among the family members and their representation of both class I (HDAC1, 2, and 3) and class II (HDAC6). SAHA, as expected, showed no selectivity among HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6, inhibiting their activity to a similar extent (FIG. 2). Interestingly, all C4-SAHA analogs (1a-f) displayed more potent inhibition against HDAC6 compared to HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (FIG. 2 and Table 3). The analogs that showed the greatest difference in potency with HDAC6 versus the other isoforms were C4-n-butyl (1c) and C4-benzyl (1f). The C4-methyl SAHA analog (1a) showed the smallest difference in potency comparing HDAC6 to HDAC1 and HDAC3 (FIG. 2 and Table 3). This single concentration screen suggested that C4-modification of the SAHA structure results in selectivity for HDAC6.

To further assess selectivity, IC50 values for derivatives 1b-f were determined with HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 isoforms (Table 4). HDAC8 was included due to its similar active site structure compared to HDAC6.31 For comparison, the non-selective parent molecule SAHA and the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin (FIG. 1) were also tested as control compounds (Table 4).28 As expected, the non-selective inhibitor SAHA showed similar low nanomolar IC50 values with HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, but a 6- to 27-fold reduction in potency against HDAC8.28 In contrast, the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin displayed 87- to 130-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC1, 2, and 3, and 11-fold selectivity for HDAC6 over HDAC8, which is consistent with prior studies.28, 41 As expected based on the single concentration screen, analogs 1b-f displayed preference for HDAC6 and HDAC8, with 28- to 740-fold selectivity compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Tables 2 and 5). Importantly, analogs 1b-f maintained low nanomolar IC50 values in the 57 to 290 nM range with HDAC6 and HDAC8 (Tables 2), similar to SAHA. Among the analogs, C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) displayed the highest selectivity, with 210- to 740-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Table 4 and 5), and potent inhibition with low nanomolar IC50 values (140 and 57 nM with HDAC6 and HDAC8, respectively, Table 4). Similarly, C4-n-butyl (1c) and C4-n-hexyl (1d) SAHA demonstrated 170- to 480-fold HDAC6/8-selectivity compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3 isoforms, with low nanomolar IC50 values (Tables 2 and 5). The C4-ethyl (1b) SAHA analog displayed the weakest selectivity among the analogs, with 28- and 46-fold selectivities for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (Tables 2 and 5). Comparing the IC50 values of the analogs to the parent SAHA (Table 4), the higher HDAC6 selectivities are due to minimal reductions in HDAC6 inhibition (2.5 to 3-fold reduction), but dramatically reduced potency against HDAC1, 2 and 3 (51- to 2,100-fold reduction, Table 4). Remarkably, the analogs displayed enhanced potency with HDAC8 compared to the parent SAHA compound (2- to 9-fold enhancement, Table 4), which lead to the observed HDAC8 selectivities.

In terms of a structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, modifying SAHA at the C4 position with long alkyl substituents led to enhanced selectivity; the C4-hexyl 1d analog with the longest alkyl chain demonstrated elevated selectivity (210- to 480-fold) compared to the C4-butyl 1c analog (170- to 310-fold), which were both more selective than the C4-ethyl analog 1b with the smallest alkyl chain (28- and 46-fold, Tables 4 and 12). For these alkyl analogs, selectivity was due to discrimination against HDAC1, 2, and 3, with the least selective C4-ethyl analog 1b demonstrating greater potency to HDAC1, 2, and 3 (4.4-6.0 μM, Table 4) compared to the most selective C4-hexyl analog 1d (30-38 μM, Table 4). The length of the substituent also influenced the selectivities of the analogs with aryl groups at the C4 position; the lack of a methylene in C4-phenyl analog 1e led to decreased selectivity (38- to 350-fold, Table 12) compared to the C4-benzyl analog 1f (210- to 740-fold). Similar to the alkyl series, the reduced selectivity of C4-phenyl analog 1e was due to greater potency with HDAC1 and 2 (11 and 12 μM, Table 4) compared to C4-benzyl analog 1f (29 and 32 μM, Table 4), in addition to decreased potency with HDAC8 (290 nM, Table 4) compared to C4-benzyl analog 1f (57 nM, Table 4). In total, the SAR analysis indicated that longer substituents at the C4 position led to greater HDAC6/8 selectivity primarily due to discrimination against HDAC1, 2, and 3.
Compared to previously reported inhibitors, the observed HDAC6 selectivities of the analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f (at least 170-, and 210-fold, Table 12) were higher than the selectivity observed with the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubastatin (at least 87-fold, Tables 4 and 12). Moreover, analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f showed comparable HDAC8 selectivities (at least 200-, 380-, and 510-fold, Table 12) relative to the HDAC8-selective inhibitor PCI-34051 (at least 400-fold).43 Finally, C4-benzyl analog 1f showed higher dual HDAC6/8 selectivity (at least 210- and 510-fold, Table 12) compared to the known HDAC6/8-selective inhibitor BRD-73954 (75- and 250-fold selectivity to HDAC6, and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3).30
In Cellulo Selectivity Testing.
To further assess the observed HDAC6 selectivity in cellulo, the C4-benzyl (1f) SAHA analog was tested for inhibition of HDAC activities in cells. The inhibition of HDAC6 was monitored by detecting the levels of its known substrate acetyl-α-tubulin (AcTub), whereas Class I HDAC proteins (HDAC1, 2, and 3) inhibition was monitored through the levels of their known substrate acetyl-histone H3 (AcH3). SAHA or the analog 1f were incubated with U937 leukemia cells before lysis and western blot analysis of protein acetylation. As expected, SAHA showed increases levels of both acetyl-α-tubulin and acetyl-histone H3 (FIG. 3, lane 2), which is consistent with its non-selective inhibition of HDAC1, 2, 3, and 6 isoforms. In contrast, C4-benzyl (1f) showed a dose-dependent increase in levels of acetyl-α-tubulin (FIG. 3, lanes 3-5, AcTub) compared to the DMSO control (FIG. 3, lane 1), which was elevated compared to the levels of acetyl histone H3 (FIG. 3, lanes 3-5, AcH3). Greater acetylation of the HDAC6 substrate tubulin compared to the class I HDAC substrate histone 3 in cells (FIG. 3) is consistent with the HDAC6 selectivity of 1f observed in the in vitro screening (Tables 4 and 12).
In Vitro Cancer Cell Growth Inhibition.
To assess the cytotoxic effect of the HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors in cancer cells, SAHA derivatives 1c, 1d, and 1f were tested with the leukemia cell lines U937 and Jurkat, due to the prominent role of HDAC6 in leukemia.44 To assess cytotoxicity, the EC50 values of SAHA and the three analogs 1c, 1d, and 1f were determined with U937 cell line.44 SAHA showed an EC50 value of 0.88 μM (Table 4), which is consistent with the cytotoxicity previously reported.45 The non-selective inhibition of all the HDAC proteins by SAHA likely contributes to its high cytotoxicity. The C4-n-butyl (1c), C4-n-hexyl (1d), and C4-benzyl (1f) SAHA analogs displayed 34, 16, and 28 μM EC50 values with the U937 cell line, respectively (Table 4). Compared to SAHA, the analogs were 18- to 39-fold less cytotoxic. To confirm the cytotoxicity study in U937 cells, SAHA and the analogs were also tested for cytotoxicity with the Jurkat cell line. The analogs showed reduced cytotoxicity compared to SAHA (FIG. 13 and Table 13), consistent with the study in U937 cells. The reduced cytotoxicity of the analogs in U937 and Jurkat cells compared to SAHA might be due to their selectivity toward HDAC6 and 8. Consistent with this hypothesis, similar micromolar cytotoxicities were also observed with HDAC6-selective inhibitors in previous reports.37, 46-47
Enantioselective Synthesis and Screening of (R)- and (S)-C4-Benzyl SAHA Analog (1f).
Since all analogs were synthesized and screened as racemic mixtures, single enantiomers of the most selective analog C4-benzyl SAHA 1f were synthesized to test selectivities. The asymmetric syntheses of both enantiomers were carried out utilizing Evan's oxazolidinone chiral auxiliary (R)-8 (Scheme 2).48 To ultimately prepare (R)-1f, 4-pentenoyl chloride was reacted with chiral auxiliary (R)-8 using n-butyllithium, which yielded pentenoyl oxazolidinone intermediate (R)-9 (Scheme 2A). Enantioselective reaction of benzyl bromide with (R)-9 gave the diastereomeric intermediate (RS)-10. To ultimately prepare (S)-1f, a similar procedure was employed (Scheme 2B), but reacting 3-phenylpropanoyl chloride with chiral auxiliary (R)-8, followed by enantioselective reaction with allyl bromide to give diastereomeric intermediate (RR)-10. Both diastereomers were obtained with high diastereomeric ratios (dr), which were assessed by 1HNMR analysis (99:1 dr for (RS)-10, and 97:3 dr for (RR)-10).
To remove the chiral auxiliary from (RS)-10 and (RR)-10, each diastereomer was reacted with lithium aluminum hydride, which produced alcohols (S)-11 and (R)-11 (Scheme 2). To assess the optical purity and enantiomeric excess (ee) of the alcohol intermediates (S)-11 and (R)-11, Mosher esters were synthesized by coupling each alcohol with (R)-(+)-α-Methoxy-α-trifluoromethylphenylacetic acid ((R)-MTPA) using EDCI and DMAP (Scheme S1).49 Analysis of the 1HNMR spectra showed that both Mosher esters were observed in high diastereomeric ratios (99:1 dr for (S)-11-(R)-MTPA, and 98:2 dr for (R)-11-(R)-MTPA), which implies that the alcohol intermediates (S)-11 and (R)-11 were obtained with high enantiomeric ratios (98% ee for (S)-11 and 96% ee (R)-11).
To synthesize enantiopure C4-benzyl SAHA analogs (R)-1f and (S)-1f, both alcohols (S)-11 and (R)-11 were then converted to methanesulfonate esters, followed by substitution with dimethyl malonate to give diesters (R)-13 and (S)-13, respectively (Schemes 3). Krapcho decarboxylation afforded methyl ester intermediates (S)-14 and (R)-14. Cross metathesis of the methyl esters with N-phenyl acrylamide 15 using Grubbs' second generation catalyst afforded ester amides (S)-16 and (R)-16.5 Finally, reduction followed by substitution with hydroxyl amine gave both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA analog, (R)-1f and (S)-1f (Schemes 3).
To assess the selectivities of enantiomers (R)-C4-benzyl SAHA (R)-1f and the (S)-C4-benzyl SAHA (S)-1f, IC50 values of both were determined with HDAC1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 (Table 4). Similar to the racemic mixture, both enantiomers showed dual HDAC6/HDAC8 selectivity. (R)-C4-benzy SAHA (R)-1f displayed more potent inhibition against HDAC6 and HDAC8 compared to the (S)-C4-benzyl SAHA (S)-1f, with IC50 values of 48 and 27 nM for (R)-1f and 95 and 150 nM for (S)-1f (Table 4). In addition, (R)-1f showed greater fold preference for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 (520- to 1300-fold, Table 12) compared to the racemic mixture (210- to 740-fold). In contrast, (S)-1f showed lower fold selectivities (240- to 540-fold, Table 12) compared to both (R)-1f and the racemic mixture (Tables 4 and 12). In summary, in vitro screening revealed that both (R)-1f and (S)-1f are highly selective for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3 with nanomolar potency. However, (R)-1f was more potent and selective than (S)-1f (Tables 4 and 12).
Docking Studies
To rationalize the experimental results, docking studies with both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) were performed using the AutoDock 4.2 and Autodock tools programs.51-52 The recently reported crystal structure of HDAC6 (PDB: 5GOH)53 along with HDAC3 crystal structure (PDB: 4A69)54 were used in these studies. SAHA, the parent molecule, was also examined with both crystal structures for comparison and to validate the docking procedure. With HDAC6, both enantiomers of C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) were positioned similarly in the active site compared to SAHA, with the hydroxamic acid moiety near the catalytic metal, the linker region in the 11 Å channel, and the anilide group in the solvent exposed region. In addition, the hydroxamic acid groups bound within 1.9-2.7 Å of the active site residues (H573, H574, and Y745) and the active site catalytic zinc atom (FIG. 4A), similar to that of the parent molecule SAHA (1.7-2.7 Å). Superimposition of each enantiomer with SAHA in the HDAC6 active site showed similar binding of the hydroxamic acid moiety. The docking studies with the HDAC6 crystal structure are consistent with the high binding affinity of C4-benzyl SAHA and SAHA in vitro (Table 4).
To explain the observed selectivities, (R)-1f and (S)-1f were also docked into the HDAC3 crystal structure. Longer and weaker binding interactions were observed with (R)-1f and (S)-1f in the HDAC3 structure (2.1-5.0 Å, FIG. 4B) compared with the HDAC6 structure (1.9-2.7 Å). Superimposition of each enantiomer with SAHA in the HDAC3 structure showed a shift in the position of the hydroxamic acid moieties away from the catalytic metal compared to SAHA (FIG. 4D). The docking analysis suggests that the presence of a bulky substituent on the C4 position weakens binding to HDAC3 due to steric clash with the relatively narrow and long 11 Å channel of HDAC3. In particular, the steric clash of the bulky substituent with active site residues positions the hydroxamic acid moieties away from the metal binding region (FIG. 4B). In contrast, HDAC6 maintains a wider and shorter V-shaped 11 Å channel, which can accommodate relatively large C4 substituents without affecting hydroxamic acid-metal binding (FIG. 4A).
Structural analysis of prior HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors are consistent with our docking analysis suggesting that HDAC6 maintains a wider and shorter 11 Å channel compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3.29, 53 Valpropylhydroxamic acid (FIG. 1) with a propyl substituent in the linker region showed selectivity for HDAC6 and 8, although with micromolar potency and low fold selectivity (9-17-fold selectivity against with HDAC1, 2, and 3).55 Inhibitors bearing a bicyclic or phenyl ring in the linker displayed dual HDAC6 and HDAC8 selectivity (BRD-73953 and Aminotetralin 32, FIG. 1).30, 36-37 Finally, SAHA analogs with a hexyl or benzyl substituent at the C2 linker also demonstrated dual HDAC6/8 selectivity (FIG. 1).41 Based on these prior reports and our docking studies, we hypothesize that substitutents at the C4 position of SAHA can be accommodated in the relatively wider and shorter V-shaped 11 Å cavity of HDAC6 active site (FIG. 4A, S155A, 4C, S155C, and S156A), but not the narrower and relatively longer 11 Å cavity of HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 (FIGS. 4B and 4D). In addition, the size of the substituent plays a critical role in the selectivity. For example, analogs bearing smaller substituents (as methyl or ethyl in 1a or 1b) demonstrated lower selectivity (Table 2) compared to analogs comprising bulkier substituents (as butyl, hexyl, phenyl, and benzyl 1c-1f) (FIG. 2 and Table 4). In total, the docking results are consistent with previously reported structural studies suggesting that the wider HDAC6 active site entrance is the source of selectivity.
In conclusion, SAHA analogs modified at the C4 position were synthesized and screened for potency and selectivity. C4-SAHA analogs showed up to 1300-fold dual selectivity for HDAC6 and HDAC8 over HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3. The best analogs were C4-n-butyl SAHA (1c) and C4-benzyl SAHA (1f). C4-benzyl SAHA (1f) showed the highest fold selectivity with 210- to 740-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 compared to HDAC1, 2, and 3, and 140 and 57 nM IC50 with HDAC6 and HDAC8. Interestingly, the fold selectivity of the C4-benzyl SAHA analog was higher than the recently reported dual HDAC6/8 selective inhibitors (at least 23-, 75-, and 79-fold).30, 36-37 Furthermore, in cellulo testing of the C4-benzyl analog showed consistency with the in vitro screening. Enantioselective synthesis and screening of both enantiomers of the C4-benzyl SAHA revealed that (R)-C4-benzyl SAHA is more potent and selective than the (S) enantiomer, with 48 and 27 nM IC50 with HDAC6 and HDAC8, and 520- to 1300-fold selectivity for HDAC6 and 8 over HDAC1, 2, and 3. The dual HDAC6/HDAC8 selective C4-SAHA analogs reported in this work can be useful as biological tools to understand the role of HDAC6 and HDAC8 in cancer, and as well as lead compounds towards development of more effective anti-cancer drugs. More generally, these studies with SAHA analogs suggest that modifying current drugs can significantly improve their properties.
Experimental Procedures
I. Materials and Instrumentation
Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, or Fisher Scientific. “Iron-free” glassware was prepared by rinsing glass vessels with a 5M aqueous HCl solution, followed by washing with distilled de-ionized water. “Iron-free” silica gel was prepared by washing with 5M aqueous HCl, followed by washing with distilled de-ionized water until colorless, and subsequently drying under air or in the oven at 80° C. NMR spectra were taken on a Varian or Agilent 400 or 600 MHz instruments. 1HNMR spectra showed NMR solvents peaks at 3.3 ppm (for CD3OD) and at 4.9 ppm (for trace amounts of water in NMR solvent), while 13CNMR spectra showed NMR solvent peaks at 77 (for CDCl3) or at 47 (for CD3OD).56 Infrared (IR) spectra were taken on Perkin Elmer Spectrum Two ATR-FTIR. Low resolution mass spectra (LRMS) were taken on Waters ZQ LC-SQMS, while high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) spectra were taken on a Waters LCT-MS premier TOF. HPLC analysis to assess the purity of final compounds was performed with a Waters 1525 binary HPLC pump and Waters 2998 Photodiode Array detector. The separation was performed on a reverse phase HPLC analytical column (YMC America, 250×4.6 mmI.D, 4 μm, 8 nm) using a gradient of 90% to 10% of buffer A over 30 minutes (buffer A=0.1% HPLC grade TFA in water; buffer B=HPLC grade acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min at room temperature. The peaks were detected at wavelength 254 nm. The synthesized final compounds were found to be >97% pure. Flash chromatography was performed with 40-60 micron LC60A silica gel (Davisil).

Synthesis of (S)-4-benzyl-N1-hydroxy-N8-phenyloctanediamide ((S)-1f)
A procedure similar to that of (R)-1f was followed, except the following reagents were used: (R)-16 (283 mg, 0.8 mmol), Pd (58 mg of 20 wt. % Pd on carbon). Hydroxylamine HCl (557 mg, 8.02 mmol) and KOH (900 mg, 16.03 mmol) were added once only and the reaction was stirred for 3 hours at 0° C. The product was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (acetone:dichloromethane 1:4-1:2) using iron-free silica gel to afford (S)-1f (133 mg, 47% over two steps). 1HNMR (400 MHz, CD3OD) δ (ppm): 1.33 (m, 2H), 1.59-1.82 (m 5H), 2.14 (m, 2H), 2.30 (m, 2H), 2.53 (dd, J=7.2 and 13.6 Hz, 1H), 2.61 (dd, J=6.8 and 13.6 Hz, 1H), 7.05-7.16 (m, 4H), 7.21 (t, J=7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.28 (t, J=7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (d, J=7.6 Hz, 2H). 13CNMR (100 MHz, CD3OD) δ (ppm): 22.28, 28.83, 29.76, 31.71, 36.62, 38.93, 39.57, 119.91, 123.73, 125.46, 127.86, 128.34, 128.84, 138.43, 140.65, 171.70, 173.13.

III. Procedures for Biological Screenings
III.A. HeLa Cell Lysis
Lysates were prepared according to the reported procedure.28 HeLa-S3 cells (purchased from Biovest) were lysed in lysis buffer (1×109 cells in 10 mL lysis buffer; 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (GenDEPOT)) with rotation at 4° C. for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm at 4° C. for 30 min. Protein concentration of the supernatant was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay (BioRad, Bradford reagent). Lysates were stored at −80° C.
III.B. Global HDAC Inhibition
To measure global HDAC inhibition, HeLa cell lysates (1 μg total protein) were mixed with HDAC-Glo™ buffer in polystyrene 96-well half area white plate (Corning) to a final volume of 12 μL, followed by addition of inhibitors in DMSO (0.5 μL) and incubation for 15 min at room temperature without rocking. An uninhibited control reaction was also included that contained DMSO (0.5 μL). Finally, deacetylase activity was measured using the HDAC-Glo™ assay kit (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Specifically, the HDAC-Glo™ substrate (1 mL) and developer (1 L) were first premixed to form the HDAC-Glo™ reagents. Then, to monitor deacetylase activity, HDAC-Glo™ reagent (5 μL) and HDAC-Glo™ buffer (7.5 μL) were added to each well (25 μL total volume) and incubated for 35 min at room temperature without rocking. The deacetylase activity was measured as luminescent signal using a GeniosPlus Fluorimeter (Tecan) at optimal gain. The concentrations of inhibitors reported in the dose-dependent studies (Table 2) are final concentrations after addition of HDAC-Glo™ reagent HDAC-Glo™ buffer. The luminescent signal was first background corrected with the signal from a negative control reaction where no lysates was added to that reaction. Then percent deacetylase activity was calculated by dividing the background corrected signal for each reaction by the background corrected signal of the uninhibited control, then multiplied by 100. IC50 values were calculated by fitting the percent deacetylase activity remaining as a function of inhibitor concentration to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (y=100/(1+(x/IC50)z), where y=percent deacetylase activity and x=inhibitor concentration) using non-linear regression with KaleidaGraph 4.1.3 software (Tables 1 and 2).
III.C. Inhibitor Testing with HDAC Isoforms28
Individual wells of a high binding polystyrene 96-well white opaque plate (Thermo Scientific) were incubated with binding buffer (100 μL; 0.2 M carbonate/0.2 M bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.4) containing primary HDAC1 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, H3284, 100 μL of 10 μg/mL), primary HDAC2 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, H3159, 100 μL of 10 μg/mL), HDAC3 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, H3034, 100 μL of 25 μg/mL), or primary HDAC6 antibody (Sigma Aldrich, SAB1404771, 100 L of 2 g/mL) with rocking (3 rpm) for 1 hr at room temperature, or at 4° C. overnight with no rocking. For all reactions, unbound antibody was removed by washing quickly three times with TBST buffer (400 μL; 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), followed by a fourth wash with TBST (400 μL) with 5 minutes incubation and rocking (3 rpm) at room temperature. Blocking of the unbound regions of the well was accomplished with 5% non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer (350 μL) for 1 hr at room temperature with rocking (3 rpm). To affix HDAC enzyme to the plate, HeLa cell lysates (100 μL of 100 μg/mL for HDAC1 and HDAC2, or 100 μL of 1 mg/mL for HDAC3 and HDAC6 in TBST buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) non-fat dry milk) were added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 4° C. without rocking, followed by washing with TBST, as described previously. HDAC-Glo™ buffer (24 μL) was added to each well, followed by addition of inhibitors in DMSO (1 μL) and incubation for 15 min at room temperature without rocking. An uninhibited control reaction was also included that contained DMSO (1 μL) in HDAC-Glo™ buffer (24 μL). To monitor deacetylase activity, the HDAC-Glo™ reagent (prepared as described earlier, 25 μL) was added to each well (50 L total volume) and incubated for 30-40 min at room temperature without rocking. Deacetylase activity was measured as luminescent signal using a GeniosPlus Fluorimeter (Tecan) at optimal gain. The concentrations of inhibitors reported in the single dose screen (FIG. 2 and Table 3) and dose-dependent studies (Tables 5-11, and FIGS. 5-11) are final concentrations after addition of HDAC-Glo™ reagent. For both the single concentration screen and dose-dependent reactions to determine IC50, the luminescent signal was first background corrected with the signal from a negative control reaction where the HDAC antibody was absent in the initial antibody binding step. Then percent deacetylase activity was calculated by dividing the background corrected signal for each reaction by the background corrected signal of the uninhibited control, then multiplied by 100. The mean percent deacetylase activity along with standard error of three independent trials is reported in FIG. 2.
Inhibitory activity with HDAC8 was measured using the following procedure. In a half area 96-well white opaque plate, recombinant HDAC8 (75 ng, BPS Bioscience) was incubated in HDAC-Glo™ buffer (39 μL) with inhibitor in DMSO (1 μL), or DMSO alone (1 μL) as a control, for 15 minutes at room temperature. HDAC-Glo™ reagent (10 μL) was added to each reaction and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Luminescent signal was measured 30 minutes after adding the substrate reagent using a Geniosplus Fluorimeter (Tecan) at optimal gain. To determine IC50, the luminescent signal was first background corrected with the signal from a background control reaction where no HDAC8 enzyme was added.
IC50 values were calculated by fitting the percent deacetylase activity remaining as a function of inhibitor concentration to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (y=100/(1+(x/IC50)z), where y=percent deacetylase activity and x=inhibitor concentration) using non-linear regression with KaleidaGraph 4.1.3 software (Tables 2, 5-11, FIGS. 5-11).
III.D. In Cellulo Selectivity Testing
U937 cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin under humidified conditions (37° C., 5% CO2). Cells were added (106 cells/well) to a 12 well plate in RPMI-1640 (no phenol red) media, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (990 μL final volume). The cells were treated with DMSO (10 μL) or the inhibitor in DMSO (10 μL) and incubated for 18 hours under humidified conditions (37° C., 5% CO2). The cells were then harvested, washed once with cold DPBS (500 μL, HyClone), and then lysed with lysis buffer (20 μL) containing 1× protease inhibitor for 30 minutes at 0° C. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was then quantified using Bradford assay reagent (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. Equal quantities of proteins were mixed with β-mercaptoethanol (10% of the final volume) and SDS loading buffer (25% of the final volume, 200 mM Tris-Cl [pH 6.8], 400 mM DTT, 8% SDS, 0.4% bromophenol blue, 40% glycerol) before the proteins were denatured at 95° C. for 3 minutes. The proteins in each sample were separated by 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), then transferred to PVDF membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) at room temperature for 1 h. The blocked membrane was incubated with a primary antibody (anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 5174P); anti-Acetyl-α-tubulin(Lys40) (Cell Signaling, 5335P), or anti-Acetyl-histone H3(Lys9) (Cell Signaling, 9649P) at a 1:1000 dilution in TBST buffer at 4° C. overnight. Finally, the membrane was incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Cell signaling, 7074S; 7:10000) at room temperature for 1 h. HRP activity was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence light-based detection substrate, SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (ThermoFisher Scientific, 34075). Gel images in FIGS. 3 and 12 are representative of three independent trials.
III.E. In Vitro Cell Growth Inhibition
Jurkat or U937 cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin under humidified conditions (37° C., 5% CO2). Cells were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates with a density of 4×104 cells in 99 μL of media composed of RPMI-1640 (no phenol red), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were treated with 1 μM or 10 μM single concentrations or serial dilution (2-fold) of compounds 1c, 1d, or 1f in DMSO (1 μL). DMSO only was used in the no inhibitor control. A negative control was also included where no cells were added. The plate was incubated for 44 hours at 37° C. in humid 5% CO2 atmosphere. A solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in PBS buffer (10 μL of 5 mg/mL) was added to each well. The cells were incubated for another 4 h at 37° C. in humid 5% CO2 atmosphere for development to take place. The resulting purple formazan crystals were dissolved by addition of DMSO (150 μL) and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm using a Geniosplus Fluorimeter (Tecan). For all the wells, the signal was background corrected with the signal from a negative control reaction (media and MTT only) before the percent viable cells was calculated. The percent viable cells was calculated by dividing the absorbance with inhibitor by the absorbance without inhibitor (DMSO, cells, and MTT). The assay was performed at least three independent times. For the single concentrations experiment, the mean percent viable cells, along with standard error of three independent trials, is reported in FIG. 3. EC50 values were calculated by fitting the percent viable cells as a function of inhibitor concentration to a sigmoidal dose-response curve (y=100/(1+(x/EC50)z), where y=percent viable cells and x=inhibitor concentration) using non-linear regression with KaleidaGraph 4.1.3 software (Tables 2).
IV. Docking Procedure
The AutoDock 4.2 and Autodock tools programs51-52 were used to perform the docking studies. HDAC6 catalytic domain 2 (CD2) (PDB: 5GOH)53 and HDAC3 (PDB: 4A69)54 crystal structures were downloaded from the protein data bank. PyMOL program (Schrodinger, LLC) was used to delete the co-crystallized inhibitor (S-trichostatin A), ethylene glycol molecules, potassium ions and all water molecules in HDAC6 crystal structure. With HDAC3 crystal, chain A, deacetylase-activation-domain (DAD) (from the SMRT corepressor), glycerol, D-myo-inositol-1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate and glycerol molecules, acetate, potassium and sulfate ions, and all water molecules were deleted. Only the zinc atom remained in both crystal structures. AutoDockTools-1.5.4 program 51-52 was used to add all polar hydrogen atoms, modify histidine protonation (H573 and H574 residues of HDAC6, and H134 and H135 of HDAC3) by adding only HD1, compute Gasteiger charges, and merge all non polar hydrogen, followed by generation of the pdbqt output file. The charge of the zinc atom was manually changed from zero to +2. For HDAC6, a grid box with a spacing of 0.375 Å, size of 42×40×44, and coordinates for the center of the grid box (−13.000, −2.000, −5.000) were used. For HDAC3, a grid box of size 58×58×54 Å3 with a spacing of 0.375 Å and centered at (8.166, 76.663, 21.318) were used. The map type was set by choosing the ligand and then AutoGrid 4.2 was used to pre-calculate and generate the grid map files required for the docking calculations. All the docked compounds were drawn in ChemBioDraw Ultra 12.0, and MM2 energy minimization was done using Chem 3D Pro 12.0. Then AutoDockTools-1.5.4 program was used to add hydrogens, compute Gasteiger charges, merge non-polar hydrogens, choose torsions, and generate the pdbqt files. All acyclic bonds were made rotatable, except the amide bonds. The AutoDock 4.2 program was used to perform the docking calculations using a genetic algorithm. The generated pdbqt file for the enzymes were set as a rigid macromolecule and the genetic algorithm search parameters were set to 100 GA runs for each ligand with a population size of 150, a maximum number of 2.5×105 energy evaluations, a maximum number of 2.7×104 generations, a mutation rate of 0.2 and a crossover rate of 0.8. The docking parameters were set to default. All output DLG files were converted to pdbqt format and the results were visualized in PyMOL. Among the 100 docked poses generated, the lowest energy poses displaying optimal distances between the hydroxamic acid group of the inhibitor and the catalytic metal of the protein were discussed in the text.
