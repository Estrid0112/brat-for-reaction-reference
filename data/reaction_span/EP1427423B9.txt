This invention relates to benzothiazepine and benzothiadiazepine derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts and prodrugs thereof. These benzothiazepines and benzothiadiazepines possess ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitory activity and accordingly have value in the treatment of disease states associated with hyperlipidaemic conditions and they are useful in methods of treatment of a warm-blooded animal, such as man. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said benzothiazepine and benzothiadiazepine derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments to inhibit IBAT in a warm-blooded animal, such as man.
It is well-known that hyperlipidaemic conditions associated with elevated concentrations of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol are major risk factors for cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease (for instance "Coronary Heart Disease: Reducing the Risk; a Worldwide View" Assman G., Carmena R. Cullen P. et al; Circulation 1999, 100, 1930-1938 and "Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease: A Statement for Healthcare Professionals from the American Heart Association" Grundy S, Benjamin I., Burke G., et al; Circulation, 1999, 100, 1134-46). Interfering with the circulation of bile acids within the lumen of the intestinal tracts is found to reduce the level of cholesterol. Previous established therapies to reduce the concentration of cholesterol involve, for instance, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, preferably statins such as simvastatin and fluvastatin, or treatment with bile acid binders, such as resins. Frequently used bile acid binders are for instance cholestyramine and cholestipol. One recently proposed therapy ("Bile Acids and Lipoprotein Metabolism: a Renaissance for Bile Acids in the Post Statin Era" Angelin B, Eriksson M, Rudling M; Current Opinion on Lipidology, 1999, 10, 269-74) involved the treatment with substances with an IBAT inhibitory effect.
Re-absorption of bile acid from the gastro-intestinal tract is a normal physiological process which mainly takes place in the ileum by the IBAT mechanism. Inhibitors of IBAT can be used in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia (see for instance "Interaction of bile acids and cholesterol with nonsystemic agents having hypocholesterolaemic properties", Biochemica et Biophysica Acta, 1210 (1994) 255- 287). Thus, suitable compounds having such inhibitory IBAT activity are also useful in the treatment of hyperlipidaemic conditions. Substituted compounds possessing such IBAT inhibitory activity have been described, see for instance hypolipidaemic compounds described in WO 93/16055, WO 94/18183, WO 94/18184, WO 96/05188, WO 96/08484, WO 96/16051, WO 97/33882, WO 98/38182, WO 99/35135, WO 98/40375, WO 99/35153, WO 99/64409, WO 99/64410, WO 00/01687, WO 00/4756S, WO 00/61565, WO 01/68906, DE 19825804, WO 00/38725, WO 00/38726, WO 00/38727, WO 00/38728, WO 00/38729, WO 01/68906 and EP 0 864 582.
A further aspect of this invention relates to the use of the compounds of the invention in the treatment of dyslipidemic conditions and disorders such as hyperlipidaemia, hypertrigliceridemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia (high LDL), hyperprebetalipoproteinemia (high VLDL), hyperchylomicronemia, hypolipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and hypoalphalipoproteinemia (low HDL). In addition, these compounds are expected to be useful for the prevention and treatment of different clinical conditions such as atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, arrhythmia, hyper-thrombotic conditions, vascular dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, heart failure, coronary heart diseases, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, peripheral vascular diseases, inflammation of cardiovascular tissues such as heart, valves, vasculature, arteries and veins, aneurisms, stenosis, restenosis, vascular plaques, vascular fatty streaks, leukocytes, monocytes and/or macrophage infiltration, intimal thickening, medial thinning, infectious and surgical trauma and vascular thrombosis, stroke and transient ischaemic attacks.
The present invention is based on the discovery that certain benzothiazepine and benzothiadiazepine compounds surprisingly inhibit IBAT. Such properties are expected to be of value in the treatment of disease states associated with hyperlipidaemic conditions.

It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group. Particular examples of modifications include the reduction of a nitro group to an amino group by for example, catalytic hydrogenation with a nickel catalyst or treatment with iron in the presence of hydrochloric acid with heating; oxidation of alkylthio to alkylsulphinyl or alkylsulphonyl.
It will also be appreciated that in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary/desirable to protect any sensitive groups in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable and suitable methods for protection are known to those skilled in the art. A particular instance where a protecting group may be used is in protecting the nitrogen in the 2-position of the benzothiadiazepine ring during the synthesis of certain intermediates.
Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T.W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1999). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.
