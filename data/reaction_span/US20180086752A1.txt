The field of the invention is pharmaceutical compounds, compositions, and methods, and uses thereof in treatment of diseases associated with mutant KRAS proteins.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The background description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art.
All publications and applications referred to herein are incorporated by reference to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent application were specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. Where a definition or use of a term in an incorporated reference is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein, the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in the reference does not apply.
K-Ras (or Ki-Ras or Kirsten-Ras) is a 21 kD member of the Ras family of GTPase proteins and a necessary component in cell signaling. Activated K-Ras typically activates downstream kinases necessary for the propagation of growth factor and other receptors signals (e.g., c-Raf and PI3-kinase). Unfortunately, genetic alterations in the gene encoding K-Ras are associated with development of neoplasias, and the mechanism of activation is relatively well understood.
Cancer-associated mutant K-Ras is constitutively active, with prolonged stabilization of its GTP-bound (active) state, and is thus able to constitutively activate downstream effectors such as Raf kinase and phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K). Both of these kinases play important roles in proliferation/survival/anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. These mutations have been implicated in insensitivity to EGFR-targeted anti-cancer therapies as mutations in K-Ras predispose cancer cells to be significantly less responsive to EGFR targeting therapies (e.g., Panitumumab, Cetuximab, etc.). Interaction with the Ras GTPase activating protein (RasGAP) is vital to the timely inactivation of K-Ras, resulting in more efficient hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. The conformational changes in K-Ras structure due to the GTP hydrolysis result in the elimination of K-Ras' affinity for effector proteins, thereby inactivating downstream proliferation and anti-death pathways. Cancer-associated mutations in K-Ras have been shown to interact poorly with RasGAP, therefore remaining in the “on” or constitutively active position.
Approximately 33% of all human tumors express mutant Ras, and these mutations often stabilize Ras in GTP-bound (active) state. Mutations found in K-Ras associate strongly with pancreatic cancer (90%), biliary tract cancer (33%), colorectal cancer (32%), and lung cancer (20%), among others. Approximately 20-25% of all human tumors harbor an activating mutation in gene encoding K-Ras.
Examples of cancer-associated mutations are found at glycine-12 (Gly12), Gly13, and glutamine-61 (Gln61), with Gly12 being the predominant site of mutagenesis (88%). Most notably, while the most common Gly12 mutations are defects in the same position, different mutations have their own different characteristics. For example, expression of G12C is often associated with a reduced response to cisplatin and an increased sensitivity to taxol and pemetrexed, whereas the expression of G12D mutant typically results in resistance to taxol treatment and sensitivity to sorafenib. The G12V mutant shows a strong sensitivity to cisplatin when compared with the wild type variant and is slightly more resistant to pemetrexed. Such diversity in treatment response is compounding difficulties in finding adequate treatment with drugs that are specific to K-Ras, and also highlight that specific mutant forms of K-Ras may require specific drugs for inhibition of the K-Ras activity.
More recently, specific drugs have been proposed to target a particular mutant form of K-Ras. For example, WO2013/155223A1 discloses small molecule inhibitors for G12C mutant forms. While promising, issues with restricted use and potential toxicity may limit compounds presented in the '223 reference. To circumvent mutant specific forms, allosteric inhibitors were proposed (PLOS One October 2011, Volume 6, Issue 10, e25711). However, that report did not distinguish among different mutant forms.
In view of the important role mutant K-Ras plays in various neoplastic disease states, it would be advantageous to be able to identify compounds that bind specifically to the mutant K-Ras protein forms associated with cancer diseases states and/or specific mutant forms, and most preferably to a specific mutant type with little or no binding to the wild type.
Thus, even though various forms of inhibitors for K-ras are known in the art, there remains a need for compositions and methods that preferentially or even selectively target mutant K-Ras, and especially a single mutant form.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
The inventive subject matter is directed to compounds, compositions, and methods for inhibiting mutant K-Ras, and especially inhibiting G12V and/or G12D mutant K-Ras. Most preferably, the compounds presented herein inhibit G12V and/or G12D mutant K-Ras with high selectivity over other mutant forms and high specificity over wild type K-Ras.
In one aspect of the inventive subject matter, a compound having a structure according to Formula I
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00001.TIF </img>
wherein X is O or S, wherein R1 and R2 are independently H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halogen, -OH, -NHC(O)alkyl, or -NHC(O)aryl, wherein R3 is H, C1-C4 alkyl, -NHR6, or -OR6, wherein R6 is H, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, wherein R4 and R5 together form an optionally substituted heterocyclic 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring, or R4 is null when R5 is -NHC(O)alkyl or -NHC(O)aryl.
In further preferred aspects, R1 and R2 are independently H, alkyl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycloalkyl. For example, R1 may be alkyl or cycloalkyl, and R2 may be alkyl. Most preferably, but not necessarily, X is S, and/or R3 is H or C1-C4 alkyl. Additionally, it is generally preferred that the optionally substituted heterocyclic 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring contains a nitrogen atom, and that the ring further contains an oxo substituent. Therefore, the phenyl group carrying R4 and R5 may form together with the heterocyclic 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring a two- or three-ringed structure, including
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00002.TIF </img>
Therefore, and viewed from another perspective, contemplated compounds may have a structure according to Formula II
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00003.TIF </img>
wherein X is O or S, wherein R1 and R2 are independently H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halogen, -OH, -NHC(O)alkyl, or -NHC(O)aryl; wherein R3 is H or C1-C4 alkyl; and wherein R7 is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl or alkheteroaryl. For example, contemplated compounds include those in which R1 is alkyl or cycloalkyl, and in which R2 is alkyl. As before, it is preferred that at least in some compounds X is S, and/or that R3 is H.
For example, especially preferred compounds will have a structure of Formula III or Formula IV where R3 is H, methyl, or halogen.

In another aspect of the inventive subject matter, the inventors contemplate a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more compounds as presented above. Most preferably, the compound(s) is/are present at a concentration effective to inhibit K-ras in a mammal when administered to the mammal at a dosage effective to inhibit K-ras in the mammal. Moreover, it is generally preferred that the K-ras is a mutant K-ras. For example, especially contemplated composition include those in which the compound preferentially inhibits mutant K-ras G12D relative to mutant K-ras G12V and mutant K-ras G12C.
Consequently, the inventors also contemplate the use of a compound as presented above to inhibit K-ras signaling, and in most preferred uses, the compound has a structure according to Formula II, Formula III, or Formula IV. Thus, it is also contemplated that K-ras signaling is mediated by a mutant K-ras. For example, the mutant K-ras is K-ras G12D, and the compound preferentially inhibits mutant K-ras G12D relative to mutant K-ras G12V and mutant K-ras G12C.
Viewed from another perspective, the inventors therefore also contemplate the use of a compound as presented herein in the manufacture of a medicament to treat a neoplastic disease, and especially where the neoplastic disease is associated with a mutant K-ras (e.g., K-ras G12D). For example, the compounds in such medicament may have a structure according to Formula II, Formula III, or Formula IV.
Alternatively, the inventors also contemplate a method of inhibiting mutant K-ras. Such methods will typically include a step of contacting (in vitro or in vivo) the mutant K-ras with contemplated compounds at a concentration effective to inhibit the mutant K-ras (e.g., where the mutant K-ras is K-ras G12D). For example, especially preferred compounds preferentially inhibit mutant K-ras G12D relative to mutant K-ras G12V and mutant K-ras G12C. Suitable concentrations will be effective to reduce downstream signaling with respect to at least one of MEK signaling and ERK signaling.
In yet a further aspect of the inventive subject matter, the inventors also contemplate a method of treating a neoplastic disease (e.g., colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer) in a mammal in need thereof, wherein such methods comprise a step of administering to the mammal contemplated compounds under a protocol effective to inhibit K-ras in the mammal. For example, suitable compound will have a structure according to Formula II, Formula III, or Formula IV, and/or it is contemplated that the step of administering will comprise oral administration or injection.
Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the inventive subject matter will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, along with the accompanying drawing figures in which like numerals represent like components.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
The inventors have now discovered that certain compounds can be prepared that will preferentially or even selectively inhibit mutant K-ras. Such compounds were found to have a scaffold as schematically illustrated in Formula A
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00005.TIF </img>
where X and Q are independently and typically a five-membered heteroaromatic ring (and most typically an optionally substituted thiazole or oxazole), A comprises an aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic moiety (most typically a substituted phenyl or tetrahydroquinoline), and M is one or more substituents such as an alkyl, a cyclocalkyl, an alkenyl, or halogen.
The term “substituted” as used herein refers to a replacement of an atom or chemical group (e.g., H, NH2, or OH) with a functional group, and particularly contemplated functional groups include nucleophilic groups (e.g., -NH2, -OH, SH, -NC, etc.), electrophilic groups (e.g., C(O)OR, C(X)OH, etc.), polar groups (e.g., -OH), non-polar groups (e.g., aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, etc.), ionic groups (e.g., NH3+), and halogens (e.g., -F, -Cl), and all chemically reasonable combinations thereof. Thus, the term “functional group” as used herein may refer to a nucleophilic group (e.g., -NH2, -OH, SH, -NC, -CN etc.), an electrophilic group (e.g., C(O)OR, C(X)OH, C(Halogen)OR, etc.), a polar group (e.g., -OH), a non-polar group (e.g., aryl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, etc.), an ionic group (e.g., NH3+), and a halogen.
While not limiting to the inventive subject matter, the inventors discovered that the heterocyclic ring system for Q and X are preferably five-membered heteroaryl systems that may or may not be substituted with one or more substituents. Therefore, and among other suitable heteroaryl systems, especially preferred X and Q group include a thiazole ring, an oxazole ring, am imidazole ring, a trizole ring, a furan ring, and a thophene ring. In still further preferred aspects, and particularly where Q is an oxazole or thiazole, it is preferred that Q one or two hydrogen atoms in Q in the oxazole or thiazole are substituted by a C1-C4 alkyl moiety, which may be cyclic. Thus, especially preferred substituents include methyl, ethyl, trifluoromethyl, propyl, and cyclopropyl for each of the substituents as depicted in the exemplary list of Q moieties having one or two M substituents (here identified as R4 and R5, which may preferably be an alkyl, a cyclocalkyl, an alkenyl, a hydroxy, a trifluoromethyl, or a halogen).
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00006.TIF </img>
Similarly, it should be appreciated that the X group may vary considerably. However, especially preferred X groups are optionally substituted thiazoles, particularly where the thiazole is substituted with a relatively small substituent (e.g., methyl, hydroxyl, halogen, etc.)
With respect to the A group, it is contemplated that such group will preferably include an aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclic moiety that includes an aromatic portion. Most typically, the A group will therefore comprise a phenyl ring that may be fused with one or more other aromatic, saturated, or unsaturated ring systems, which may or may not include a heteroatom. For example, where A is a substituted phenyl ring, the substituent is preferably an amine group that may be coupled to an acyl moiety. On the other hand, where the A group is a fused ring system, at least one of the rings will preferably comprise a phenyl group while the other ring is preferably heterocyclic ring. For example, suitable A groups include those listed below.
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00007.TIF </img>
As used herein, and unless the context dictates otherwise, the term “coupled to” is intended to include both direct coupling (in which two elements that are coupled to each other contact each other) and indirect coupling (in which at least one additional element is located between the two elements). Therefore, the terms “coupled to” and “coupled with” are used synonymously.
Therefore, and where the X group is a thiazole and where the Q group is an oxazole or a thiazole, contemplated compounds may have a structure according to Formula II
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00008.TIF </img>
in which X is O or S, and in which R1 and R2 are independently H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, halogen, -OH, -NHC(O)alkyl, or -NHC(O)aryl. It is preferred that R3 in such compounds is H or C1-C4 alkyl (which may be cyclic), and/or that R7 is H, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, alkaryl or alkheteroaryl. Most preferably, however, contemplated compounds include those in which R1 is alkyl or cycloalkyl (and especially cyclopropyl), and in which R2 is alkyl (and especially methyl), particularly where X is S, and where R3 is H.
For example, especially preferred compounds will have a structure of Formula III or Formula IV where R3 is H, methyl, or halogen.
<img> id-US20180086752A1-20180329-C00009.TIF </img>
Certain compounds contemplated herein may comprise one or more asymmetric centers, and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. It should be recognized that all enantiomeric forms of contemplated compounds are specifically contemplated herein. Similarly, where contemplated compounds exhibit optical activity and/or have stereoisomers, all isomeric forms are contemplated herein. Furthermore, where double bonds distinguish a Z-form from an E-form (or cis- from trans-), both isomers are contemplated.
Still further, it should be recognized that the compounds according to the inventive subject matter may also be isotopically-labeled. Examples of suitable isotopes 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 18F, or 36Cl. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the inventive subject matter, for example those into which 14C or 3H is incorporated, may be useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. On the other hand, substitution with non-radioactive isotopes (e.g., 2H or 13C) can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances.
Contemplated compounds may be prepared as pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s), which especially include salts of acidic or basic groups which may be present in the contemplated compounds. For example, contemplated compounds that are basic in nature may form a wide variety of salts with various inorganic and organic acids. Suitable acids will provide pharmacologically acceptable anions, including chloride, bromide, iodide, nitrate, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, acid phosphate, isonicotinate, acetate, lactate, salicylate, citrate, acid citrate, tartrate, pantothenate, bitartrate, ascorbate, succinate, maleate, gentisinate, fumarate, gluconate, glucaronate, saccharate, formate, benzoate, glutamate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, and pamoate [1,1'-methylene-bis-(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate)] anions. Similarly, compounds that are acidic in nature may form base salts with various pharmacologically acceptable cations, and especially suitable cations include alkali metal or alkaline earth metal ions (e.g., sodium and potassium cations).
It is still further especially contemplated that compounds according to the inventive subject matter may also be prepared as prodrugs, and all known manners and types of prodrugs are considered suitable for use herein, so long as such prodrug will increase the concentration of the drug (or metabolite of the prodrug) at a target organ or target cell. For example, where the compounds have a free amino, amido, hydroxy, thio, or carboxylic group, it is contemplated that such groups can be employed to covalently and releasably bind a moiety that converts the drug into a prodrug. Therefore, prodrugs particularly include those in which contemplated compounds forms an ester, amide, or disulfide bond with another cleavable moiety. Such moieties may assist in organ or cell-specific delivery of the drug. For instance, a carboxyl group can be derivatized to form an amide or alkyl ester, which may include an ether, amine-, and/or carboxylic acid group. Free hydroxy groups may be derivatized using hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, as outlined in D. Fleisher, R. Bong, B. H. Stewart, Advanced Drug Delivery 40 Reviews (1996) 19, 115. Carbamate prodrugs of hydroxy and amino groups are also included, as are carbonate prodrugs and sulfate esters of hydroxy groups. Derivatization of hydroxy groups as (acyloxy)methyl and (acyloxy)ethylethers, wherein the acyl group may be an alkyl ester (optionally substituted), or where the acyl group is an amino acid ester are also contemplated (Prodrugs of this type are described in R. P. Robinson et al., J. Medicinal Chemistry (1996) 39:p.10).
Still further, it should also be recognized that contemplated compounds may be metabolized in a cell or extracellular compartment, and that such metabolites may exhibit the same or different pharmacological effect. For example, contemplated compounds may be phosphorylated and thus be more active than the parent compound. On the other hand, reduction or glycosylation may affect bioavailability of contemplated compounds. Consequently, contemplated compounds will not only include those as described above, but also include metabolites thereof.
Viewed from another perspective, it should be thus be appreciated that contemplated compounds and compositions may be used for all conditions and/or disorders that are associated with a dysregulation and/or dysfunction of K-ras, and especially with a mutant form of K-ras (particularly G12D and/or G12V). For example, contemplated conditions and disorders include various cancers, and especially pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.
Viewed from yet another perspective, the present inventive subject matter is directed to various compounds that modulate (e.g., inhibit or reduce) K-ras dependent signaling in a cell, and/or that directly or indirectly affect (mutant) K-ras, GTP binding, and effector protein interaction to so interfere with signal transduction. Exemplary compounds will therefore not only include the compounds as discussed above, but also various derivatives that impart one or another advantageous property.
Based on the inventors' discovery of biological activity of contemplated compounds, it is generally contemplated that the compounds according to the inventive subject matter may be formulated for treatment of various diseases associated with dysregulation and/or dysfunction of K-ras or mutant K-ras. Therefore, and among other contemplated uses, the inventors especially contemplate that pharmaceutical compositions comprising contemplated compounds may be effective for the treatment or prevention of K-ras signaling dependent cancers, and especially colon cancer, pancreactic cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, wherein contemplated pharmaceutical compositions comprise a therapeutically effective amount of contemplated compounds (or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, or prodrug thereof), and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Therefore, it should be recognized that contemplated compounds are suitable for use to inhibit K-ras signaling, and/or for the manufacture of a medicament to treat a neoplastic disease that is associated with a mutation in K-ras, especially where the K-ras has a G12D or G12V mutation. Therefore, the inventors also contemplate a method of inhibiting mutant KRAS, comprising a step of contacting the mutant KRAS with a method of inhibiting K-ras or mutant K-ras using contemplated compounds at a concentration effective to inhibit the (mutant) K-ras. As used herein, the term “inhibit” or “inhibition” in conjunction with K-ras activity means a reduction in activation of downstream signaling components (e.g., MEK, Erk, etc.) as compared to activity of the same (mutant) K-ras without exposure to the inhibitory compound under otherwise identical conditions.
It is therefore particularly preferred that contemplated compounds are included in a composition that is formulated with one or more non-toxic and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Preferred pharmaceutical compositions are formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, or for parenteral injection. Thus, it should be recognized that the pharmaceutical compositions according to the inventive subject matter may be administered to humans and other animals using various routes, including oral, rectal, parenteral, intraperitoneal, vaginal, or topical administration.
For example, suitable pharmaceutical compositions for injection preferably comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, emulsions, or suspensions, as well as sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc.), and suitable mixtures thereof, oils, and injectable organic esters (e.g., ethyl oleate). Contemplated compositions may also contain various inactive ingredients, including preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and/or dispersing agents. Sterility may be ensured by inclusion of antibacterial and/or antifungal agents (e.g., paraben, phenol sorbic acid, chlorobutanol, etc.). Where appropriate, osmotically active agents may be included (e.g., sugars, sodium chloride, etc.).
Alternatively, contemplated compositions may be formulated into solid dosage forms for oral administration, and may therefore be capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules. In preferred solid dosage forms, contemplated compound are mixed with at least one of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier (e.g., sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate), a filler or extender (e.g., starch, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, or silicic acid), a binder (e.g., carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, etc.), a humectant (e.g., glycerol), a disintegrating agent (e.g., agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, or sodium carbonate), a solution retarding agent (e.g., paraffin), an absorption accelerator (e.g., quaternary ammonium compound), a wetting agents (e.g., cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate), and absorbents (e.g., kaolin, or bentonite clay), and a lubricant (e.g., talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate).
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. Contemplated compositions may further be formulated to release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. Contemplated compounds may also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art (e.g., water, or other solvent, solubilizing agents), emulsifiers (e.g., ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide), oils (and in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound. Compounds according to the inventive subject matter can also be administered in form of liposomes, which may be unilamellar, oligolamellar, or polylamellar. Contemplated compositions in liposome form may further contain stabilizers, preservatives, excipients, etc. Preferred lipids for liposome formation include phospholipids and the phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins), both natural and synthetic. Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33 et seq.
Actual dosage levels of contemplated compounds in pharmaceutical compositions according to the inventive subject matter may be varied so as to obtain an amount of contemplated compound(s) that is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration. Thus, the selected dosage level will depend upon various factors, including the activity of the particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated, and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. Generally, dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.1 mg/kg, or about 0.1 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg, or about 1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg, or about 10 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg of body weight per day. Thus, single dosage units for administration will typically be between 0.1 mg and 1 mg, between 1 mg and 50 mg, between 50 mg and 250 mg, between 250 mg-1,000 mg, between 1,000 mg and 5,000 or even higher when administered orally to a mammalian patient. If desired, it should be appreciated that the effective daily dose may be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration, e.g., two to four separate doses per day.
Unless the context dictates the contrary, all ranges set forth herein should be interpreted as being inclusive of their endpoints, and open-ended ranges should be interpreted to include commercially practical values. Similarly, all lists of values should be considered as inclusive of intermediate values unless the context indicates the contrary. In some embodiments, the numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as concentration, reaction conditions, and so forth, used to describe and claim certain embodiments of the invention are to be understood as being modified in some instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, in some embodiments, the numerical parameters set forth in the written description and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by a particular embodiment. In some embodiments, the numerical parameters should be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of some embodiments of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as practicable. The numerical values presented in some embodiments of the invention may contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.
It should still further be appreciated that contemplated pharmaceutical compositions may also include additional pharmaceutically active compounds, and especially contemplated additional pharmaceutically active compounds include anti-metabolic and/or antineoplastic agents and/or immunologically active agents, which may act upon cell division, apoptosis, T-cell recognition, NK-cell activity, memory cell formation, checkpoint inhibition, and/or immune stimulation. Of course, it should be recognized that additional pharmaceutically active compounds may be included in the same pharmaceutical composition, or may be administered separately, and a person of ordinary skill in the art will readily determine schedule and route of suitable co-administration of the additional pharmaceutically active compounds.

The running buffer in all surface plasmon resonance experiments was 10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20, 1 mM MgCl2, 8% DMSO. Experiments were carried out on the SensiQ Pioneer optical biosensor. The flow rate was set at 50 μL/min and the temperature was 25° C. kRAS protein was immobilized to the Nickel-NTA charged surface of the SensiQ HisCap chip (sensiqtech.com) giving a yield of 4000 RU. Small molecules were prepared in 100% DMSO and further diluted to 8% DMSO in running buffer. The small molecules were injected using the Taylor diffusion gradient injection mode (OneStep®, see e.g., Evaluation of Taylor dispersion injections: Determining kinetic/affinity interaction constants and diffusion coefficients in label-free biosensing, John G. Quinn, Analytical Biochemistry (2011)). Buffer blanks were injected for double referencing purposes. Data processing and model fitting were performed using Qdat.
In-cell selectivity of the compounds presented herein against a specific K-ras mutant form can also be tested as shown in the following exemplary experiment. 293H cells were seeded in 6-wells and transfected next day with 5 μg of Ras wild-type, or G12C, G12D or G12V mutant DNA plasmid vector. Next day cells were treated with 3.125-50 μM of Ras compounds for 1 hour. Wild-type transfected cells were subsequently treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 minutes. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, lysed in complete lysis buffer on ice, and processed by G-LISA according to Cytoskeleton protocol. FIG. 1 depicts exemplary results. As is readily apparent, the tested compound A0837 (identical with 4562 of FIGS. 4A-4D) had pronounced selectivity towards the G12D mutant form and exhibited also a lower IC50 as compared to the wild type.
To verify the results in specific cancer cell lines, cancer cell lines BxPC-3 (K-Ras wild-type), Panc10.05 (K-Ras G12D mutant), and Capan-2 (K-Ras G12V) were treated with 3.1 to 25 μM of Ras compound A0837 for 1 hour before stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 minutes. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, lysed in complete lysis buffer on ice, and processed by G-LISA according to Cytoskeleton protocol. As can be clearly seen in FIG. 2, the tested compound had clear selectivity towards K-ras mutant G12D, which is consistent with the other results presented above.
The effect of contemplated compounds on cell signaling was tested in wild type and K-ras G12D mutant cells as follows: Cancer cell lines BxPC-3 (K-Ras wild-type), and Panc10.05 (K-Ras G12D mutant) were serum-starved 0/N before treatment with 3.1 to 25 μM of Ras compound A0837 for 1 hour before stimulation with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 minutes. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, lysed in complete lysis buffer on ice, and processed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions for the detection of pMEK and pErk. Membranes were stripped and re-probed for total MEK/Erk. FIG. 3 shows the results of such experiment, establishing that the tested compound inhibited signaling downstream of Ras in the mutant cell line but not in the K-Ras wild type cell line.
In still further experiments, the inventors tested selected compounds in a G-LISA assay to compare IC50 values for wild-type and various mutant K-Ras (G12D, G12V) using the following general protocol: 293H cells were seeded in 6-wells at 0.6×106 cells per well and transfected next day with 5 μg of Ras wild-type, or G12C, G12D or G12V mutant DNA plasmid vector using transfection reagent Lipofectamine 3000. Next day cells were treated with 3.125-50 μM of Ras compounds for 1 hour. Wild-type transfected cells were subsequently treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 minutes. Cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS, lysed in complete lysis buffer on ice, and processed by G-LISA according to Cytoskeleton protocol.
Table 5 provides typical results in μM for the selected compounds tested, and the corresponding structures are shown in FIGS. 4A-4D. As can be seen, certain of the tested compounds had preferential/selective inhibition favoring G12D over wild-type and/or other mutant forms. N/A is result not available
