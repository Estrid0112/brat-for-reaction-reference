The present invention further relates to provide a process for the preparation of crystalline form of novel salt of Ethacrynic acid.
Description of Related Art
Ethacrynic acid is chemically known as [2,3-dichloro-4-(2-methylene-1-oxobutyl) phenoxy] acetic acid and is represented by a compound of structural formula I as mentioned below.
<img> id-US20180111890A1-20180426-C00001.TIF </img>
Ethacrynic acid is a potent diuretic and is marketed under the brand name ‘Edecrin’. Ethacrynic acid was first disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,255,241 and the process for preparing Ethacrynic acid was disclosed in this Patent is shown below:
<img> id-US20180111890A1-20180426-C00002.TIF </img>
The above-mentioned process for preparing Ethacrynic acid involves the steps of hydrolysing the intermediate 2,3-dichloro-4-[2-dimethylaminomethyl]butyryl-phenoxy acetic acid hydrochloride with sodium bicarbonate solution to obtain sodium ethacrynate; followed by acidification of the solution containing sodium ethacrynate by hydrochloric acid to yield Ethacrynic acid.
The Patents U.S. Pat. No. 3,322,821 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,479,402 also discloses the preparation of Ethacrynic acid involving the acidification of the solution containing sodium ethacrynate to yield Ethacrynic acid.
The Publication entitled “A New Lead for Nonpeptidic Active-Site-Directed Inhibitors of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Main Protease Discovered by a Combination of Screening and Docking Methods” by Ulrich Kaeppler et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2005, Vol. 1, No. 4 discloses the potassium carbonate instead sodium bicarbonate during the hydrolysis of 2,3-dichloro-4-[2-dimethylaminomethyl]butyryl-phenoxy acetic acid hydrochloride resulting potassium Ethacrynate followed by acidification to yield Ethacrynic acid.
The above processes employ potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate as a base for hydrolysis of [2,3-dichloro-4-[2-dimethylaminomethyl butyrylphenoxy acetic acid hydrochloride to ethacrynic acid.
The publication entitled “Liquid chromatographic analysis of ethacrynic acid and degradation products in pharmaceutical systems” by Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Vol. 74, No. 2, 1985 states that heating ethacrynic acid in alkali medium results in dimeric derivative of ethacrynic acid as shown below:
<img> id-US20180111890A1-20180426-C00003.TIF </img>
The inventors of present invention have also observed that the Ethacrynic acid formed with processes reported in literature results in high level of dimeric impurity. The dimeric impurity could be formed during the hydrolysis of intermediate 2,3-dichloro-4-[2-dimethylaminomethyl]butyryl-phenoxy acetic acid hydrochloride in the alkali medium due to degradation. The formation of this impurity decreases the quality and yields of the final Ethacrynic acid API.
Hence there is need to improve the process for the preparation of Ethacrynic acid that would be more convenient and suitable for large scale manufacture with better yield and desired quality.
