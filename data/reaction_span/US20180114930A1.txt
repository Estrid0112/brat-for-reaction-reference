BACKGROUND
Photovoltaic cells convert radiation, for example visible light, into direct current (DC) electricity. Organic solar cells (OSC) are organic photoelectric conversion devices which comprise conductive organic polymers or organic small molecules, for light absorption, charge generation and charge transport. Organic dye compounds find use in many applications, including solar panels and photodetectors. They may also be part of larger systems comprising other organic electronic devices, such as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs).
A common small-molecule OSC structure is formed by a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) electrode, typically Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), an organic hole collecting layer (for example the doped polymer PEDOT:PSS), a photoactive layer, and the metallic contact, in some cases a thin interlayer of calcium or lithium fluoride. The photoactive layer is formed from a blend of donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. Typically, the acceptor semiconductor is a soluble fullerene derivative and the donor semiconductor is a small-molecule organic dye compound.
Suitable dye compounds for small-molecule OSCs have been reported in the literature, e.g. in Fitzner, R et al., Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2012, 134, 11064-11067, which is incorporated herein fully by reference. However, there is still a need for dye compounds for OSCs with improved properties.

The compounds according to Formula (I) and Formula (II) can be advantageously prepared from fluorinated thiophene precursors. Such precursors include fluorinated dithiophene compounds, such as, for example, compounds selected from:
where X is selected from the group consisting of B(OR2), SnR3, and SiR3, and where R is independently alkyl, alkylidene, aryl, or heteroaryl. These dithiophene compounds can be used in coupling reactions to prepare compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (II), or other compounds, e.g., by use in reactions that form a covalent bond between two different ring systems.
These processes for the preparation of compounds of Formula (I) or (II) are generally performed in presence of a solvent. Examples of suitable solvents include but are not limited to hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene), alcohols (e.g. tert-butanol), acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, or mixtures thereof. The processes are usually performed under inert atmosphere, i.e., under an atmosphere which is virtually free of oxygen, and in a solvent which is virtually free of dissolved oxygen. The solvent is usually degassed by passing nitrogen through the reaction mixture or by performing at least one freezing-thawing cycle under vacuum. Other methods for providing solvents that are virtually free of dissolved oxygen are known.
The coupling reactions can advantageously be carried out at a temperature in the range from 0 to 150° C., preferably in the range from 50 to 100° C.
Coupling reactions wherein X is SnR3 are preferably carried out in dehydrated solvents, such as dehydrated dioxane. SnR3 is preferably trialkyltin, for example, tributyltin or trimethyltin. LiCl can be added to the reaction mixture.
Coupling reactions wherein X is SiR3 are preferably carried out in the presence of fluoride ions. Fluoride salts, for example, tetrabutylammonium fluoride, are a suitable source of fluoride ions. Also preferably, SiR3 can be SiMe3, Si(iso-Pr)3 or SiEtCI2.
The coupling reactions are advantageously carried out in the presence of a transition-metal catalyst.
Suitable examples of transition metal catalysts are tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0), Pd(Ph)4, Pd(OAc)2 or PdCl2. Most preferred is Pd(Ph)4.
The coupling reactions can advantageously be carried out in the presence of one or more phosphorus-containing ligands and/or one or more bases. Suitable examples of phosphorus-containing ligands are triphenylphosphine and 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl. Suitable examples for bases are hydroxides, phosphates, alkoxides and carbonates of elements of the group 1 or group 2 elements, e.g., sodium hydroxide, cesium carbonate, potassium phosphate or potassium tert-butoxide. Advantageously, these bases can be used in the form of an aqueous solution, more particularly a solution in water.
The compounds of the present invention may be further isolated, for instance by column chromatography, preferably by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).

3,4-difluoro-5'-hexyl-[2,2'-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde (OHC-2)
In a flame dried flask equipped with an addition funnel, 3,4-difluoro-5'-hexyl-2,2'-bithiophene [2] (8.5 g, 29.7 mmol) was dissolved in dry 1,2-dichloroethane (150 mL) and cooled to 0° C. The Vilsmeier reagent was prepared by adding POCl3 (5.46 g, 35.6 mmol, 3.32 mL) to DMF (3.3 g, 45 mmol, 3.43 mL) and the orange solution was added dropwise via addition funnel. The reaction was then heated at 80° C. for 20 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3. The aqueous portion was extracted with DCM (3×100 mL) and the combined organics were washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo to give the crude product, which was further purified by chromatography on silica gel (2% EtOAc/hexanes) to furnish a yellow solid (6.53 g, 20.8 mmol, 70% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ=9.98 (s, 1H), 7.29 (d, J=3.6 Hz, 1H), 6.80 (d, J=3.6 Hz, 1H), 2.84 (t, J=7.5 Hz, 2H), 1.70 (quint, J=7.2 Hz, 2H), 1.40-1.29 (m, 6H), 0.89 (t, J=6.6 Hz, 3H); 19F NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ=−127.02 (s, 2F).

General BODYIPY Synthesis
To a stirring solution of appropriately substituted pyrrole (5 g, 52 mmol) dissolved in DCM (100 mL) at 40° C. was added an acid chloride (heptanoyl, benzoyl, etc) (25 mmol) dropwise. Once the addition was complete the reaction was allowed to stir until it was deep red in colour (1-18 hours). At this time the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and treated with Hunig's base (75 mmol) at a rate that prevented excessive boiling of the solvent. After stirring for 30 minutes the (now pale) reaction was treated with BF3OEt2 and heated at 30° C. overnight. The next day the reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and washed repeatedly with water before drying with MgSO4 and concentrating in vacuo. The crude material was then dissolved in DCM and passed through a plug of SiO2 (eluting with DCM) and the red band with yellow/green emission was collected. Further purification was performed using flash column chromatography 20-60% DCM in hexane.
4-bromo-BODIPY
The above compound was prepared according to the general BODIPY synthesis described above using 2,4-dimethyl-pyrrole, and 4-bromobenzoyl chloride. 11 NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ=7.64 (d, J=8 Hz, 2H), 7.18 (d, J=8 Hz, 2H), 5.99 (s, 2H), 2.55 (s, 6H), 1.41 (s, 6H).
4-Bromo-BODIPY-(2)

Piperidine (1 mL) was added and the solution heated to 120° C. The reaction was monitored by UV/Vis and was stopped after the consumption of the starting material. After cooling, the solution was passed through a short silica plug, eluting with toluene. The solvent was evaporated and the crude material was fused to silica gel (10 g) and purified by flash chromatography (35% DCM/hexanes). The DCM was removed by rotary evaporation and the resultant solids were collected by gravity filtration, washed with hexanes and acetone, then dried in vacuo to yield the final product as a purple solid (350 mg, 0.35 mmol, 34% yield). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ=7.65 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.43 (s, 4H), 7.23 (d, J=8.3 Hz, 2H), 7.13 (d, J=3.6 Hz, 2H), 6.74 (d, J=3.4 Hz, 2H), 6.59 (s, 2H), 2.83 (t, J=7.4 Hz, 4H), 1.75-1.61 (m, 8H), 1.45 (s, 6H), 1.43-1.31 (m, 8H), 0.90 (t, J=6.8 Hz, 6H). 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3) δ=−125.96 (s, 1F), −138.84 (q, J=34 Hz, 1F). 11B NMR (128 MHz, CDCl3) δ=1.14 (t, J=34 Hz, 1B).
Device Fabrication and Measurements
The small molecule dyes described are useful in organic solar cell applications. The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device structure was utilized to show the applicability of the dyes, although other device structures can be used. In the fabricated BHJ devices the photoactive layer includes a blended film of the small molecule dye manufactured and an electron deficient/accepting molecule or polymer. As examples, the BHJ devices consisted of blended films with {6,6}-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) acceptors.
A typical BHJ device structure includes the photoactive layer sandwiched between interfacial/transport layers to facilitate charge extraction and two conductive charge collecting electrodes, one of which is transparent. The devices fabricated were composed of the following layers; glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS or MoOx/BHJ/ZnO-np/Al, where ITO is indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate), MoOx is molybdenum trioxide, ZnO-np is zinc oxide nanoparticles and Al is aluminum.
Films for devices were prepared on patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (Thin Film Devices Inc.) and served as the bottom transparent charge-collecting electrode. The ITO substrates were cleaned by sonication in a soap solution, acetone, isopropanol followed drying with a nitrogen gas flow and baking in an oven. Cleaned ITO substrates were exposed to a UV-ozone treatment for >30 min. and immediately used for either a 25 nm spin coated PEDOT:PSS (Clevious P VP AL 4083) layer or a 15 nm vacuum thermal deposited MoO3 (99.98%, Sigma-Aldrich) layer.
The following BHJ films were prepared from ≥40 mg/ml chlorobenzene (CB) or o-xylene stock solutions of donor compounds and PC71BM (Solenne Inc.) depending on the small molecule dye used. Stock solutions were mixed at various ratios and addition of high boiling additives to make the appropriate BHJ solutions. Filtered (0.45 μm PTFE) BHJ solutions were spun cast at various spin speed to control films thickness and immediately annealed at the appropriate temperature for >5 minutes. ZnO-np films were then spun cast on top of the BHJ film from 2-methoxyethanol stock solutions and did not required any additional annealing. The organic solar cell devices were completed by thermal deposition (<10−6 torr base pressure) of 120 nm Al top electrodes having a 13.2 mm2 area via a shadow mask.
Device performance was assessed from current density versus voltages (J-V) measurements acquired with a LabView controlled multiplexed Keithley source-measured unit under 100 mW/cm2 illumination from a Newport 1600 W Xenon arc lamp. The illumination intensity was calibrated using a Newport meter and calibrated 91150V reference cell. All measurements were performed in inert atmosphere glovebox with <0.5 ppm oxygen. Optical absorption measurements were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda Spectrometer.
Performance characteristics of organic solar cell devices containing dye compounds are shown in FIGS. 1A-8, and summarized in Table 1. The fluorine substituents have effects on both the physical and electronic properties of the small molecular dye compounds as observed by differences in solubility, film forming ability, film quality and device performance. The effects on electronic properties are most evident in the solar cell device parameters such as the VOC in which up to −100 mV differences are observed by the fluorine substituents.
