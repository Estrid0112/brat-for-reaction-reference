Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα, ESR1, NR3A) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ, ESR2, NR3b) are steroid hormone receptors which are members of the large nuclear receptor family. Structured similarly to all nuclear receptors, ERα is composed of six functional domains (named A-F) (Dahlman-Wright, et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 2006, 58:773-781) and is classified as a ligand-dependent transcription factor because after its association with the specific ligand, (the female sex steroid hormone 17b estradiol (E2)), the complex binds to genomic sequences, named Estrogen Receptor Elements (ERE) and interacts with co-regulators to modulate the transcription of target genes. The ERα gene is located on 6q25.1 and encodes a 595AA protein and multiple isoforms can be produced due to alternative splicing and translational start sites. In addition to the DNA binding domain (Domain C) and the ligand binding domain (Domain E) the receptor contains a N-terminal (A/B) domain, a hinge (D) domain that links the C and E domains and a C-terminal extension (F domain). While the C and E domains of ERα and ERβ are quite conserved (96% and 55% amino acid identity respectively) conservation of the A/B, D and F domains is poor (below 30% amino acid identity). Both receptors are involved in the regulation and development of the female reproductive tract and in addition play roles in the central nervous system, cardiovascular system and in bone metabolism. The genomic action of ERs occurs in the nucleus of the cell when the receptor binds EREs directly (direct activation or classical pathway) or indirectly (indirect activation or non-classical pathway). In the absence of ligand, ERs are associated with heat shock proteins, Hsp90 and Hsp70, and the associated chaperone machinery stabilizes the ligand binding domain (LBD) making it accessible to ligand. Liganded ER dissociates from the heat shock proteins leading to a conformational change in the receptor that allows dimerisation, DNA binding, interaction with co-activators or co-repressors and modulation of target gene expression. In the non-classical pathway, AP-1 and Sp-1 are alternative regulatory DNA sequences used by both isoforms of the receptor to modulate gene expression. In this example, ER does not interact directly with DNA but through associations with other DNA bound transcription factors e.g. c-Jun or c-Fos (Kushner et al., Pure Applied Chemistry 2003, 75:1757-1769). The precise mechanism whereby ER affects gene transcription is poorly understood but appears to be mediated by numerous nuclear factors that are recruited by the DNA bound receptor. The recruitment of co-regulators is primarily mediated by two protein surfaces, AF2 and AF1 which are located in E-domain and the A/B domain respectively. AF1 is regulated by growth factors and its activity depends on the cellular and promoter environment whereas AF2 is entirely dependent on ligand binding for activity. Although the two domains can act independently, maximal ER transcriptional activity is achieved through synergistic interactions via the two domains (Tzukerman, et al., Mol. Endocrinology, 1994, 8:21-30). Although ERs are considered transcription factors they can also act through non-genomic mechanisms as evidenced by rapid ER effects in tissues following E2 administration in a timescale that is considered too fast for a genomic action. It is still unclear if receptors responsible for the rapid actions of estrogen are the same nuclear ERs or distinct G-protein coupled steroid receptors (Warner, et al., Steroids 2006 71:91-95) but an increasing number of E2 induced pathways have been identified e.g. MAPK/ERK pathway and activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition to ligand dependent pathways, ERα has been shown to have ligand independent activity through AF-1 which has been associated with stimulation of MAPK through growth factor signalling e.g. insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). Activity of AF-1 is dependent on phosphorylation of Ser118 and an example of cross-talk between ER and growth factor signalling is the phosphorylation of Ser 118 by MAPK in response to growth factors such as IGF-1 and EGF (Kato, et al., Science, 1995, 270:1491-1494).
A large number of structurally distinct compounds have been shown to bind to ER. Some compounds such as endogenous ligand E2, act as receptor agonists whereas others competitively inhibit E2 binding and act as receptor antagonists. These compounds can be divided into 2 classes depending on their functional effects. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen have the ability to act as both receptor agonists and antagonists depending on the cellular and promoter context as well as the ER isoform targeted. For example tamoxifen acts as an antagonist in breast but acts as a partial agonist in bone, the cardiovascular system and uterus. All SERMs appear to act as AF2 antagonists and derive their partial agonist characteristics through AF1. A second group, fulvestrant being an example, are classified as full antagonists and are capable of blocking estrogen activity via the complete inhibition of AF1 and AF2 domains through induction of a unique conformation change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) on compound binding which results in complete abrogation of the interaction between helix 12 and the remainder of the LBD, blocking co-factor recruitment (Wakeling, et al., Cancer Res., 1991, 51:3867-3873; Pike, et al., Structure, 2001, 9:145-153).
Intracellular levels of ERα are down-regulated in the presence of E2 through the ubiquitin/proteosome (Ub/26S) pathway. Polyubiquitinylation of liganded ERα is catalysed by at least three enzymes; the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 activated ubiquitin is conjugated by E2 with lysine residues through an isopeptide bond by E3 ubiquitin ligase and polyubiquitinated ERα is then directed to the proteosome for degradation. Although ER-dependent transcription regulation and proteosome-mediated degradation of ER are linked (Lonard, et al., Mol. Cell, 2000 5:939-948), transcription in itself is not required for ERα degradation and assembly of the transcription initiation complex is sufficient to target ERα for nuclear proteosomal degradation. This E2 induced degradation process is believed to necessary for its ability to rapidly activate transcription in response to requirements for cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism (Stenoien, et al., Mol. Cell Biol., 2001, 21:4404-4412). Fulvestrant is also classified as a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD), a subset of antagonists that can also induce rapid down-regulation of ERα via the 26S proteosomal pathway. In contrast a SERM such as tamoxifen can increase ERα levels although the effect on transcription is similar to that seen for a SERD.
Approximately 70% of breast cancers express ER and/or progesterone receptors implying the hormone dependence of these tumour cells for growth. Other cancers such as ovarian and endometrial are also thought to be dependent on ERα signalling for growth. Therapies for such patients can inhibit ER signalling either by antagonising ligand binding to ER e.g. tamoxifen which is used to treat early and advanced ER positive breast cancer in both pre and post menopausal setting; antagonising and down-regulating ERα e.g. fulvestrant which is used to treat breast cancer in women which have progressed despite therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors; or blocking estrogen synthesis e.g. aromatase inhibitors which are used to treat early and advanced ER positive breast cancer. Although these therapies have had an enormously positive impact on breast cancer treatment, a considerable number of patients whose tumours express ER display de novo resistance to existing ER therapies or develop resistance to these therapies over time. Several distinct mechanisms have been described to explain resistance to first-time tamoxifen therapy which mainly involve the switch from tamoxifen acting as an antagonist to an agonist, either through the lower affinity of certain co-factors binding to the tamoxifen-ERα complex being off-set by over-expression of these co-factors, or through the formation of secondary sites that facilitate the interaction of the tamoxifen-ERα complex with co-factors that normally do not bind to the complex. Resistance could therefore arise as a result of the outgrowth of cells expressing specific co-factors that drive the tamoxifen-ERα activity. There is also the possibility that other growth factor signalling pathways directly activate the ER receptor or co-activators to drive cell proliferation independently of ligand signalling.
More recently, mutations in ESR1 have been identified as a possible resistance mechanism in metastatic ER-positive patient derived tumour samples and patient-derived xenograft models (PDX) at frequencies varying from 17-25%. These mutations are predominantly, but not exclusively, in the ligand-binding domain leading to mutated functional proteins; examples of the amino acid changes include Ser463Pro, Val543Glu, Leu536Arg, Tyr537Ser, Tyr537Asn and Asp538Gly, with changes at amino acid 537 and 538 constituting the majority of the changes currently described. These mutations have been undetected previously in the genomes from primary breast samples characterised in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Of 390 primary breast cancer samples positive for ER expression not a single mutation was detected in ESR1 (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012 Nature 490: 61-70). The ligand binding domain mutations are thought to have developed as a resistance response to aromatase inhibitor endocrine therapies as these mutant receptors show basal transcriptional activity in the absence of estradiol. The crystal structure of ER, mutated at amino acids 537 and 538, showed that both mutants favoured the agonist conformation of ER by shifting the position of helix 12 to allow co-activator recruitment and thereby mimicking agonist activated wild type ER. Published data has shown that endocrine therapies such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant can still bind to ER mutant and inhibit transcriptional activation to some extent and that fulvestrant is capable of degrading Try537Ser but that higher doses may be needed for full receptor inhibition (Toy et al., Nat. Genetics 2013, 45: 1439-1445; Robinson et al., Nat. Genetics 2013, 45: 144601451; Li, S. et al. Cell Rep. 4, 1116-1130 (2013). It is therefore feasible that certain compounds of the Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (as described hereinafter) will be capable of down-regulating and antagonising mutant ER although it is not known at this stage whether ESR1 mutations are associated with an altered clinical outcome.
Regardless of which resistance mechanism or combination of mechanisms takes place, many are still reliant on ER-dependent activities and removal of the receptor through a SERD mechanism offers the best way of removing the ERα receptor from the cell. Fulvestrant is currently the only SERD approved for clinical use, yet despite its mechanistic properties, the pharmacological properties of the drug have limited its efficacy due to the current limitation of a 500 mg monthly dose which results in less than 50% turnover of the receptor in patient samples compared to the complete down-regulation of the receptor seen in in vitro breast cell line experiments (Wardell, et al., Biochem. Pharm., 2011, 82:122-130). Hence there is a need for new ER targeting agents that have the required pharmaceutical properties and SERD mechanism to provide enhanced benefit in the early, metastatic and acquired resistance setting.
The compounds of the specification have been found to possess potent anti-tumour activity, being useful in inhibiting the uncontrolled cellular proliferation which arises from malignant disease. The compounds of the specification provide an anti-tumour effect by, as a minimum, acting as SERDs. For example, the compounds of the specification may exhibit anti-tumour activity via the ability to down-regulate the estrogen receptor in a number of different breast cancer cell-lines, for example against the MCF-7, CAMA-1, BT474 and/or MDA-MB-134 breast cancer cell-lines. Such compounds may be expected to be more suitable as therapeutic agents, particularly for the treatment of cancer.
The compounds of the specification may also exhibit advantageous physical properties (for example, lower lipophilicity, higher aqueous solubility, higher permeability, lower plasma protein binding, and/or greater chemical stability), and/or favourable toxicity profiles (for example a decreased activity at hERG), and/or favourable metabolic or pharmacokinetic profiles, in comparison with other known SERDs. Such compounds may therefore be especially suitable as therapeutic agents, particularly for the treatment of cancer.

It is to be understood that the present specification encompasses any and all such solid forms of the compound of Formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
In further embodiments there is provided a compound of Formula (I), which is obtainable by the methods described in the ‘Examples’ section hereinafter.
The present specification is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes will be understood to include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. For example, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopes of nitrogen include 15N. In a particular embodiment there is provided a compound of Formula (I) wherein R6 is deuterium.

A further suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the Formula (I) is, for example, a salt formed within the human or animal body after administration of a compound of the Formula (I) to said human or animal body.
The compound of Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be prepared as a co-crystal solid form. It is to be understood that a pharmaceutically acceptable co-crystal of a compound of the Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, form an aspect of the present specification.
The specific solid forms described herein provide X-ray powder diffraction patterns substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction patterns shown in the Figures and have the various 2-theta values as shown in the Tables included herein. It will be understood that the 2-theta values of an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may vary slightly from one machine to another or from one sample to another, and so the values quoted are not to be construed as absolute.
It is known that an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one or more measurement errors depending on measurement conditions (such as equipment or machine used). In particular, it is generally known that intensities in an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may fluctuate depending on measurement conditions. Therefore it should be understood that the solid forms of the present specification are not limited to the crystals that provide X-ray powder diffraction patterns that are identical to the X-ray powder diffraction pattern shown in the Figures, and any crystals providing X-ray powder diffraction patterns substantially the same as those shown in the Figures fall within the scope of the present specification. A person skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction is able to judge the substantial identity of X-ray powder diffraction patterns.
Persons skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction will realise that the relative intensity of peaks can be affected by, for example, grains above 30 μm in size and non-unitary aspect ratios, which may affect analysis of samples. The skilled person will also realise that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer. The surface planarity of the sample may also have a small effect. Hence the diffraction pattern data presented are not to be taken as absolute values. (Jenkins, R & Snyder, R. L. ‘Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry’ John Wiley & Sons 1996; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; Klug, H. P. & Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-Ray Diffraction Procedures).
Generally, a measurement error of a diffraction angle in an X-ray powder diffractogram is approximately plus or minus 0.2° 2-theta, and such degree of a measurement error should be taken into account when considering the X-ray powder diffraction pattern in the Figures and when reading data contained in the Tables included herein. Furthermore, it should be understood that intensities might fluctuate depending on experimental conditions and sample preparation (preferred orientation).

It is to be understood that a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable pro-drug of a compound of the Formula (I) also forms an aspect of the present specification. Accordingly, the compounds of the specification may be administered in the form of a pro-drug, which is a compound that is broken down in the human or animal body to release a compound of the specification. A pro-drug may be used to alter the physical properties and/or the pharmacokinetic properties of a compound of the specification. A pro-drug can be formed when the compound of the specification contains a suitable group or substituent to which a property-modifying group can be attached. Examples of pro-drugs include in-vivo cleavable ester or amide derivatives of the compound of the Formula (I).
Accordingly, one aspect of the present specification includes those compounds of Formula (I) as defined hereinbefore when made available by organic synthesis and when made available within the human or animal body by way of cleavage of a pro-drug thereof. Accordingly, the present specification includes those compounds of the Formula (I) that are produced by organic synthetic means and also such compounds that are produced in the human or animal body by way of metabolism of a precursor compound, that is a compound of the Formula (I) may be a synthetically-produced compound or a metabolically-produced compound.

The in-vivo effects of a compound of the Formula (I) may be exerted in part by one or more metabolites that are formed within the human or animal body after administration of a compound of the Formula (I). As stated hereinbefore, the in-vivo effects of a compound of the Formula (I) may also be exerted by way of metabolism of a precursor compound (a pro-drug).

It is to be understood that other permutations of the process steps in the process variants described above are also possible.
It will also be appreciated that, in some of the reactions mentioned hereinbefore, it may be necessary or desirable to protect any sensitive functionalities in the compounds. The instances where protection is necessary or desirable, and suitable methods for protection, are known to those skilled in the art. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see T. W. Green, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons, 1991). Thus, if reactants include groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy, it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.
A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an alkoxycarbonyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric, formic, phosphoric or trifluoroacetic acid, and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid, such as boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group, which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or hydrazine.
A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl, or a trialkyl or diarylalkyl silane, such as TBDMS or TBDPS. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.
A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.
The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.

Biological Assays
The following assays were used to measure the effects of the compounds of the present specification.
ERα Binding Assay
The ability of compounds to bind to isolated Estrogen Receptor Alpha Ligand binding domain (ER alpha-LBD (GST)) was assessed in competition assays using a LanthaScreen™ Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET) detection end-point. For the LanthaScreen TR-FRET endpoint, a suitable fluorophore (Fluormone ES2, ThermoFisher, Product code P2645) and recombinant human Estrogen Receptor alpha ligand binding domain, residues 307-554 (expressed and purified in-house) were used to measure compound binding. The assay principle is that ER alpha-LBD (GST) is added to a fluorescent ligand to form a receptor/fluorophore complex. A terbium-labelled anti-GST antibody (Product code PV3551) is used to indirectly label the receptor by binding to its GST tag, and competitive binding is detected by a test compound's ability to displace the fluorescent ligand, resulting in a loss of TR-FRET signal between the Tb-anti-GST antibody and the tracer. The assay was performed as follows with all reagent additions carried out using the Beckman Coulter BioRAPTR FRD microfluidic workstation:1. Acoustic dispense 120 nL of the test compound into a black low volume 384 well assay plates.2. Prepare 1×ER alpha-LBD/Tb-antiGST Ab in ES2 screening buffer and incubate for 15 minutes.3. Dispense 6 μL of the 1×AR-LBD/Tb-anti-GST Ab reagent into each well of the assay plate followed by 6 μL of Fluorophore reagent into each well of the assay plate4. Cover the assay plate to protect the reagents from light and evaporation, and incubate at room temperature for 4 hours.5. Excite at 337 nm and measure the fluorescent emission signal of each well at 490 nm and 520 nm using the BMG PheraSTAR.
Compounds were dosed directly from a compound source microplate containing serially diluted compound (4 wells containing 10 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM and 10 nM final compound respectively) to an assay microplate using the Labcyte Echo 550. The Echo 550 is a liquid handler that uses acoustic technology to perform direct microplate-to-microplate transfers of DMSO compound solutions and the system can be programmed to transfer multiple small nL volumes of compound from the different source plate wells to give the desired serial dilution of compound in the assay which is then back-filled to normalise the DMSO concentration across the dilution range.
In total 120 nL of compound plus DMSO were added to each well and compounds were tested in a 12-point concentration response format over a final compound concentration range of 10, 2.917, 1.042, 0.2083, 0.1, 0.0292, 0.0104, 0.002083, 0.001, 0.0002917, 0.0001042, and 0.00001 μM respectively. TR-FRET dose response data obtained with each compound was exported into a suitable software package (such as Origin or Genedata) to perform curve fitting analysis. Competitive ER alpha binding was expressed as an IC50 value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give a 50% reduction in tracer compound binding to ER alpha-LBD.
MCF-7 ER Down-Regulation Assay
The ability of compounds to down-regulate Estrogen Receptor (ER) numbers was assessed in a cell based immuno-fluorescence assay using the MCF-7 human ductal carcinoma breast cell line. MCF-7 cells were revived directly from a cryovial (approx 5×106 cells) in Assay Medium (phenol red free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM); Sigma D5921) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine and 5% (v/v) Charcoal/Dextran treated foetal calf serum. Cells were syringed once using a sterile 18G×1.5 inch (1.2×40 mm) broad gauge needle and cell density was measured using a Coulter Counter (Beckman). Cells were further diluted in Assay Medium to a density of 3.75×104 cells per mL and 40 μL per well added to transparent bottomed, black, tissue culture-treated 384 well plates (Costar, No. 3712) using a Thermo Scientific Matrix WellMate or Thermo Multidrop. Following cell seeding, plates were incubated overnight at 37° C., 5% CO2 (Liconic carousel incubator). Test data was generated using the LabCyte Echo™ model 555 compound reformatter which is part of an automated workcell (Integrated Echo 2 workcell). Compound stock solutions (10 mM) of the test compounds were used to generate a 384 well compound dosing plate (Labcyte P-05525-CV1). 40 μL of each of the 10 mM compound stock solutions was dispensed into the first quadrant well and then 1:100 step-wise serial dilutions in DMSO were performed using a Hydra II (MATRIX UK) liquid handling unit to give 40 μL of diluted compound into quadrant wells 2 (0.1 mM), 3 (1 μM) and 4 (0.01 μM), respectively. 40 μL of DMSO added to wells in row P on the source plate allowed for DMSO normalisation across the dose range. To dose the control wells 40 μL of DMSO was added to row O1 and 40 μL of 100 μM fulvestrant in DMSO was added to row O3 on the compound source plate.
The Echo uses acoustic technology to perform direct microplate-to-microplate transfers of DMSO compound solutions to assay plates. The system can be programmed to transfer volumes as low as 2.5 nL in multiple increments between microplates and in so doing generates a serial dilution of compound in the assay plate which is then back-filled to normalise the DMSO concentration across the dilution range. Compounds were dispensed onto the cell plates with a compound source plate prepared as above producing a 12 point duplicate 3 μM to 3 pM dose range with 3-fold dilutions and one final 10-fold dilution using the Integrated Echo 2 workcell. The maximum signal control wells were dosed with DMSO to give a final concentration of 0.3%, and the minimum signal control wells were dosed with fulvestrant to give a final concentration of 100 nM accordingly. Plates were further incubated for 18-22 hours at 37° C., 5% CO2 and then fixed by the addition of 20 μL of 11.1% (v/v) formaldehyde solution (in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) giving a final formaldehyde concentration of 3.7% (v/v). Cells were fixed at room temperature for 20 mins before being washed two times with 250 μL PBS/Proclin (PBS with a Biocide preservative) using a BioTek platewasher, 40 μL of PBS/Proclin was then added to all wells and the plates stored at 4° C. The fixing method described above was carried out on the Integrated Echo 2 workcell. Immunostaining was performed using an automated AutoElisa workcell. The PBS/Proclin was aspirated from all wells and the cells permeabilised with 40 μL PBS containing 0.5% Tween™ 20 (v/v) for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were washed three times in 250 μL of PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 with Proclin (PB ST with a Biocide preservative) and then 20 μL of ERα (SP1) Rabbit monoclonal antibody (Thermofisher) 1:1000 in PBS/Tween™/3% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin was added. The plates were incubated overnight at 4° C. (Liconic carousel incubator) and then washed three times in 250 μL of PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween™ 20 with Proclin (PBST). The plates were then incubated with 20 μL/well of a goat anti-rabbit IgG AlexaFluor 594 or goat anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 488 antibody (Molecular Probes) with Hoechst at 1:5000 in PBS/Tween™/3% (w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin for 1 hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed three times in 250 μL of PBS/0.05% (v/v) Tween™ 20 with Proclin (PBST with a Biocide preservative). 20 μL of PBS was added to each well and the plates covered with a black plate seal and stored at 4° C. before being read. Plates were read using a Cellomics Arrayscan reading the 594 nm (24 hr time point) or 488 nm (5 hr timepoint) fluorescence to measure the ERα receptor level in each well. The mean total intensity was normalized for cell number giving the total intensity per cell. The data was exported into a suitable software package (such as Origin) to perform curve fitting analysis. Down-regulation of the ERα receptor was expressed as an IC50 value and was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give a 50% reduction of the average maximum Total Intensity signal.

Western Blotting Assay
The ability of compounds to down-regulate estrogen receptor (ER) was assessed by western blotting using human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and CAMA-1). Cells were plated into 12-well tissue culture-treated plates at 0.5×106/well in phenol red-free RPMI containing 2 mM L-glutamine and 5% (v/v) charcoal treated foetal calf serum (F6765, Sigma). Cells were incubated with compounds (100 nM) or vehicle control (0.1% DMSO) for 48 h at 37° C., 5% CO2 before washing once with PBS and lysing with 80 μl lysis buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl, 3 mM EDTA, 3 mM EGTA, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.27 M sucrose, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 0.5% TritonX-100, pH 6.8) on ice.
Cells were scraped, sonicated and centrifuged prior to performing a protein assay (DC Bio-Rad Protein kit, 500-0116) and making samples to a protein concentration of 1-2 mg/ml in lysis buffer containing 1×LDS Sample Buffer (NP0007, Invitrogen) and 1× NuPAGE sample reducing agent (NP0009, Invitrogen). Samples were boiled for 10 min at 95° C. and then frozen at −20° C. until ready for use.
10-20 μg protein was loaded onto 26-well Criterion gels (BioRad 345-0034). Gels were run at 125 V for 1 hr 25 min in running buffer (24 mM Tris Base Sigma, 192 mM Glycine, 3.5 mM SDS, made up in distilled water). Gels were then transferred at 30V for 2 hr in transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM Glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.3, made up in distilled water) onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was stained with Ponceau S (P7170, Sigma) and cut according to appropriate molecular weight markers.
Membranes were blocked for 1 hour at room temp in 5% Marvel (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween™ 20 (PBS/Tween). Blots were then incubated with anti-ERα (SP1) rabbit monoclonal antibody (Thermofisher) diluted 1:1000 at 4° C. overnight (with gentle shaking) followed by several washes with PBS/Tween. Secondary anti-rabbit HRP antibody (7074, CST) diluted 1:2000 dilution was incubated for 2 h at room temperature (with gentle shaking) followed by several washes with PBS/Tween. All antibodies were made up in 5% Marvel (w/v) in PBS/Tween.
The immunoblots were developed using Pierce WestDura chemiluminescent reagents (Thermo Scientific 34076) and developed/quantified on the G-box using Syngene software. Down-regulation of the ERα receptor was normalised to the vehicle control (0% down-regulation) and the 100 nM fulvestrant control (100% down-regulation) run within the same gel.

Human Hepatocyte Assay
The metabolic stability of compounds in human hepatocytes was assessed using the following protocol:1. Prepare 10 mM stock solutions of compound and control compounds in appropriate solvent (DMSO). Place incubation medium (L-15 Medium) in a 37° C. water bath, and allow warming for at least 15 minutes prior to use.2. Add 80 μL of acetonitrile to each well of the 96-well deep well plate (quenching plate).3. In a new 96-well plate, dilute the 10 mM test compounds and the control compounds to 100 μM by combining 198 μL of acetonitrile and 2 μL of 10 mM stock.4. Remove a vial of cryopreserved (less than −150° C.) human hepatocytes (LiverPool™ 10 Donor Human hepatocytes obtained from Celsis IVT. Chicago, Ill. (Product No. S01205)) from storage, ensuring that vials remain at cryogenic temperatures until thawing process ensues. As quickly as possible, thaw the cells by placing the vial in a 37° C. water bath and gently shaking the vials. Vials should remain in water bath until all ice crystals have dissolved and are no longer visible. After thawing is complete, spray vial with 70% ethanol, transfer the vial to a bio-safety cabinet.5. Open the vial and pour the contents into the 50 mL conical tube containing thawing medium. Place the 50 mL conical tube into a centrifuge and spin at 100 g for 10 minutes. Upon completion of spin, aspirate thawing medium and resuspend hepatocytes in enough incubation medium to yield ˜1.5×106 cells/mL.6. Using Cellometer® Vision, count cells and determine the viable cell density. Cells with poor viability (<80% viability) are not acceptable for use. Dilute cells with incubation medium to a working cell density of 1.0×106 viable cells/mL.7. Transfer 247.5 μL of hepatocytes into each well of a 96-well cell culture plate. Place the plate on Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort plate shaker to allow the hepatocytes to warm for 10 minutes.8. Add 2.5 μL of 100 μM test compound or control compounds into an incubation well containing cells, mix to achieve a homogenous suspension at 0.5 min, which when achieved, will define the 0.5 min time point. At the 0.5 min time, transfer 20 μL of incubated mixture to wells in a “Quenching plate” followed by vortexing.9. Incubate the plate at 37° C. at 900 rpm on an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort plate shaker. At 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 80, 100 and 120 min, mix the incubation system and transfer samples of 20 μL incubated mixture at each time point to wells in a separate “Quenching plate” followed by vortexing.10. Centrifuge the quenching plates for 20 minutes at 4,000 rpm. 4 different compounds are pooled into one cassette and used for LC/MS/MS analysis.
All calculations were carried out using Microsoft Excel. Peak areas were determined from extracted ion chromatograms. In vitro intrinsic clearance (in vitro Clint, in L/min/106 cells) of parent compound was determined by regression analysis of the Ln percent parent disappearance vs. time curve. The in vitro intrinsic clearance (in vitro Clint, in L/min/106 cells) was determined from the slope value using the following equation and is shown in Table C for selected examples:
in vitro Clint=kV/N
V=incubation volume (0.25 mL);
N=number of hepatocytes per well (0.25×106 cells).

Physical Properties
log D
The lipophilicity of a drug is an important physical property which may influence many biological and metabolic properties of a compound, for example the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity profiles of a compound. The distribution coefficient between 1-octanol and aqueous buffer, Log DO/W, at pH 7.4, is the most commonly used measurement of the lipophilicity of a compound. The current method for measurement of Log DO/W is based on the traditional shake flask technique, but with the modification of measuring compounds in mixtures of ten at a time using UPLC with quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) as a method to measure the relative octanol and aqueous concentrations. The maximum capacity is 379 project compounds (48 pools with 10 compounds incl. three QC compounds) per experiment. 2 quality control (QC) samples, Cyclobenzaprine with moderate Log D and Nicardipine high Log D is used in all pools to ensure good quality. An additional QC sample Caffeine, with low Log D, are used and randomly placed in all runs. The method has been thoroughly validated against the previous shake flask methodologies.
Solubility
In order for an oral compound to reach the site of action, and in order for oral absorption from the gut to occur, that compound must be in solution, and therefore compounds which possess high intrinsic solubility may be more suitable for pharmaceutical use. The thermodynamic solubility of a research compound is measured under standard conditions. It is a shake-flask approach that uses 10 mM DMSO solutions which are supplied from the Compound Managements liquid store and is a high throughput method. The dried compounds are equilibrated in an aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 24 hours at 25° C., the portion with the dissolved compound is then separated from the remains. The solutions are analyzed and quantified using UPLC/MS/MS, QC-samples are incorporated in each assay-run to ensure the quality of the assay.
Human Plasma Protein Binding
Hunan plasma protein binding is a key factor in controlling the amount of free (unbound) drug available for binding to target and hence plays an important role in the observed efficacy of drugs in vivo. Therefore, compounds which possess high free fraction (low levels of plasma protein binding) may exhibit enhanced efficacy relative to a compound with similar potency and exposure levels. The automated equilibrium dialysis assay in human plasma uses the RED (Rapid Equilibrium Dialysis) Device and sample handling. The assay generally runs over two to three days including delivery of results. After dialysis for 18 hours, plasma and buffer samples are prepared for analysis by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Samples are generally tested in singlicates and quantified by LC/MSMS by using a 7-point calibration curve in plasma. The compounds are pooled together in plasma pools up to 10 compounds. Three reference compounds are used in each run, Propranolol, Metoprolol and Warfarin. Warfarin is used as a control in each pool and Propranolol and Metoprolol are placed randomly in each run. An in-house Excel macro is used for preparation of files for the robot and the mass spectrometer and is also used for the calculations of fraction unbound (fu %) in plasma.

hERG Binding Assay
hERG (human ether go go-related gene) potassium channels are essential for normal electrical activity in the heart. Arrhythmia can be induced by a blockage of hERG channels by a diverse group of drugs. This side effect is a common reason for drug failure in preclinical safety trials [Sanguinetti et al., Nature, 2006, 440, 463-469.] and therefore minimisation of hERG channel blocking activity may be a desirable property for drug candidates.
The purpose of the hERG binding assay is to evaluate the effects of test compounds on the voltage-dependent potassium channel encoded by the human ether go go-related gene (hERG) using a constitutively expressing CHO cell line on the Nanion Syncropatch 384PE automated patch clamp system.
The assay was conducted as follows with all reagents used at room temperature unless otherwise stated.
Reagent preparations include:
1. Internal “IC700” solution used to perfuse the underside of chip (in mM), KF 130, KCl 20, MgCl2 1, EGTA 10 and HEPES 10, (all Sigma-Aldrich; pH 7.2-7.3 using 10 M KOH, 320 mOsm) and supplemented with 25 □M escin.2. External and cell buffer (in mM), NaCl 137, KCl 4, HEPES 10, D-glucose 10, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1 (pH7.4, NaOH)3. NMDG “reference” buffer used to establish a stable baseline prior to the addition of test compounds, NaCl 80, KCl 4, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, NMDG Cl 60, D-Glucose monohydrate 5, HEPES 10 (pH7.4 NaOH 298 mOsm)4. Seal enhancer used to improve seal quality of cells, NaCl 80, KCl 3, CaCl2 10, HEPES 10, MgCl2 1 (pH7.4 NaOH)
Cell preparations:
1. If using cell culture; cells to be incubated at 30° C. for approximately 4-6 days prior to being used. Day of assay lift cells using accutase and re-suspend in 20 ml cell buffer to a density of 0.8 to 1e6 cells/ml.2. If using assay ready cryovials; rapidly thaw two cryovials at 37° C. and slowly pipette into 23 ml external solution3. All cell preps to be incubated for 15 min on the shaking cell hotel set to 10° C. prior to starting assayCompound preparations:
All compounds were acoustically dispensed in quadruplicate using a Labcyte Echo. A 10 mM stock solution is used to generate 6 compound source plates each at a different concentration to allow cumulative dosing onto cells (0.03167 mM, followed by 0.1 mM, then 0.3167 mM, 1 mM, 3.167 mM, 10 mM). 90 μl of reference buffer is added to each well of the source plates containing 600 nl of compound for a final compound concentration of 0.1 μM, 0.39 μM, 1.2 μM, 3.9 μM, 12.5 μM and 39.6 μM respectively. hERG assay (all dispense steps are performed using the liquid handling set up on the Nanion syncropatch)
1. Fill 384 well medium resistance 4 hole chips with 40 μl external buffer and perfuse internal buffer to the underside of plate.2. Dispense 20 μl of cells into each well of the chip followed by 20 μl of seal enhancer.3. Remove 40 μl of reagent from each well to the wash station, leaving a residual volume of 40 μl4. Dispense 40 μl of reference buffer with a removal step of 40 μl after 3 min, repeat this step.5. Dispense 40 μl of compound plate 1 (0.03167 mM), ‘real time’ recordings for 3 min exposure prior to removal of 40 μl. This step is repeated for 5 further subsequent compound plates in increasing concentrations to generate a cumulative concentration-effect curve in each well of the Syncropatch chip.
hERG-mediated currents were elicited using a voltage step protocol consisting of acontinuous holding voltage of −80 mV, with a 500 ms step to 60 mV followed by a 500 ms step to −40 mV every 15 seconds. hERG current magnitude was measured automatically from the leak-subtracted traces by the Nanion software by taking the peak of the hERG “tail” current at −40 mV every 15 seconds and taking the last three of these responses for each concentration to generate the concentration-effect curve.
Calculation of results is performed using APC package within Genedata. For the routine normalization of well data with Neutral and Inhibitor control well groups as reference, GeneData Assay Analyzer uses the following equation to normalize the signal values to the desired signal range:
N(x)=CR+-x-〈cr〉〈sr〉-〈cr〉(SR-CR)
x is the measured raw signal value of a well<cr> is the median of the measured signal values for the Central Reference (Neutral) wells on a plate<sr> is the median of the measured signal values for the Scale Reference (Inhibitor) wells on a plateCR is the desired median normalized value for the Central Reference (Neutral)SR is the desired median normalized value for the Scale Reference (Inhibitor)

Permeability
In order to maximize oral absorption, a drug must have sufficient transmembrane flux as well as avoid efflux by P-glycoprotein. The most widely used system for predicting oral absorption is by determination of the permeation rate of compounds through monolayers of a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2.
Human Caco-2 Bidirectional Permeability A to B and B to A
An automated assay was used to determine the bidirectional permeability (efflux and uptake) of compounds in Caco-2 cells carried out over 2 hours at pH 7.4. Samples were analyzed to through LC/MS/MS to estimate the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of compounds across Caco-2 cell monolayers and results are quoted in units of ×10−6 cm/s.
The efflux ratio (ER) can be determined using the following equation:
<in-line-formulae>ER=Papp(B-A)/Papp(A-B) </in-line-formulae>
Where Papp (B-A) indicates the apparent permeability coefficient in basolateral to apical direction, and Papp (A-B) indicates the apparent permeability coefficient in apical to basolateral direction.
Human Caco-2 Passive Permeability A to B Papp
An automated assay was used to determine the passive permeability of compounds in Caco-2 cell monolayers carried out over 2 hours with an apical pH of 6.5 and basolateral pH of 7.4. The Caco-2 AB inhibition assay is carried out with chemical inhibition of the three major efflux transporters ABCB1 (P-gp), ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCC2 (MRP2) in Caco-2 cells. Incubation of both apical and basolateral is carried out with a cocktail of inhibitors (50 μM quinidine, 20 μM sulfasalazine and 100 μM benzbromarone). Samples were analyzed through LC/MS/MS to estimate the apparent permeability coefficients (Papp) of compounds across Caco-2 cell monolayers and results are quoted in units of ×10−6 cm/s.

Human Parental MCF7 Xenograft Anti-Tumour Efficacy in Mouse
To determine the effect of Example 17 on the growth of the MCF7 xenografts, the following study was performed. MCF7 cells (ATCC) were grown in vitro in exponential phase prior to implant. Briefly, male SCID mice weighing 18 g or more (Envigo UK) were implanted subcutaneously on the back with estrogen pellets (0.5 mg, 21 day release from Innovative Research of America) under recoverable anaesthetic. One day later mice were inoculated subcutaneously on the left flank with 5 million MCF7 cells, prepared as 0.1 ml cell suspension in 1:1 RPMI (Gibco, Life Technologies) and matrigel (Corning). When tumours reached ˜250 mm3 mice were randomised into groups of 9 mice (12 mice for vehicle control) and started receiving drug treatment. Compounds were prepared in vehicle (40% Tetraethylene Glycol (v/v), 7.5% Captisol (w/v) in water for injection) and given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg once a day for 21 days at 0.5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg. Tumours were measured twice a week and tumour volume calculated using the elliptical formula (pi/6×width×width×length). Data represent the geomean of tumour volume relative to the tumour volume on day of randomisation. Error bars are the 95% confidence interval (Graphpad Prism). This study demonstrated that doses of 10 mg/kg and above gave tumour regression (FIG. 12).
Human Y537S ESR1 Mutant MCF7 Xenograft Anti-Tumour Efficacy in Mouse
To determine the effect of Example 17 on the growth of the xenografts derived from MCF7 cells genetically engineered to express Y537S ESR1, the following study was performed. Y537S ESR1 MCF7 cells were created by genome editing and express only Y537S ESR1 (Ladd, et al., Oncotarget, 2016, 7:54120-54136). Briefly, male SCID mice weighing 18 g or more (Envigo UK) were inoculated subcuaneously on the left flank with 5 million Y537S ESR1 MCF7 cells, prepared as 0.1 ml cell suspension in 1:1 RPMI (Gibco, Life Technologies) and matrigel (Corning). When tumours reached ˜250 mm3 mice were randomised into groups of 9 mice (12 mice for vehicle control) and started receiving drug treatment. Compounds were prepared in vehicle (40% Tetraethylene Glycol (v/v), 7.5% Captisol (w/v) in water for injection) and given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg once a day for 22 days at 0.5 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg. Tumours were measured twice a week and tumour volume calculated using the elliptical formula (pi/6×width×width×length). Data represent the geomean of tumour volume relative to the tumour volume on day of randomisation. Error bars are the 95% confidence interval (Graphpad Prism). This study demonstrated that doses of 10 mg/kg and above gave tumour regression (FIG. 13).
Human ESR1 Mutant Breast Cancer Patient Derived Xenograft CTC174 Anti-Tumour Efficacy in Mouse
To determine the effect of Example 17 on the growth of the ESR1 mutant patient derived xenograft CTC174, female NSG mice were implanted with fragments of CTC174 in the mammary fat pad. CTC174 were derived from circulating tumour cells isolated from a patient with metastatic ER+ breast cancer and have been shown to carry a D538G mutation in ESR1 at a 0.33 allele frequency (Ladd, et al., Oncotarget, 2016, 7:54120-54136). Briefly, female ovariectomized NOD/SCID (Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) (NSG) mice (aged 6-7 weeks-The Jackson Laboratory) were implanted under recoverable anaesthetic with a ˜50 mm3 fragment of a CTC174 xenograft in the third mammary fat pad. When tumours reached ˜200 mm3 mice were randomised into groups of 10 mice and started receiving drug treatment. Compounds were prepared in vehicle (40% Tetraethylene Glycol (v/v), 7.5% Captisol (w/v) in water for injection) and given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg once a day for 32 days at 0.8 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg. Tumours were measured twice a week and tumour volume calculated using the elliptical formula (pi/6×width×width×length). Data represent the geomean of tumour volume relative to the tumour volume on day of randomisation. Error bars are the 95% confidence interval (Graphpad Prism). This study demonstrated that doses of 10 mg/kg and above gave almost complete tumour growth inhibition (FIG. 14).
Human ESR1 Mutant Breast Cancer Patient Derived Xenograft CTC174 Anti-Tumour Drug Combination Efficacy in Mouse
To determine the effect of Example 17 on the growth of the ESR1 mutant patient derived xenograft CTC174 in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib or the mTORC1/2 inhibitor vistusertib (AZD2014), female NSG mice were implanted with fragments of CTC174 in the mammary fat pad. CTC174 were derived from circulating tumour cells isolated from a patient with metastatic ER+ breast cancer and have been shown to carry a D538G mutation in ESR1 at a 0.33 allele frequency (Ladd, et al., Oncotarget, 2016, 7:54120-54136). Briefly, female NOD/SCID (Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ) (NSG) mice (aged 6-7 weeks-The Jackson Laboratory) were implanted under recoverable anaesthetic with a ˜30 mm3 fragment of a CTC174 xenograft in the third mammary fat pad. When tumours reached ˜500 mm3 mice were randomised into groups of 10 mice and started receiving drug treatment. Ex17 was prepared in vehicle (40% Tetraethylene Glycol (v/v), 7.5% Captisol (w/v) in water for injection) and given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg once a day for 23 days at 10 mg/kg. Palbociclib and vistusertib were prepared in vehicle (1% polysorbate 80). Palbociclib was given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg once a day for 23 days at 50 mg/kg. Vistusertib was given orally in a volume of 10 ml/kg twice a day in a 2 days on, 5 days off schedule for 23 days at 10 mg/kg. Vehicle treated group were dosed with 10 ml/kg 40% Tetraethylene Glycol (v/v), 7.5% Captisol (w/v) in water for injection orally once a day for 23 days. Tumours were measured twice a week and tumour volume calculated using the elliptical formula (pi/6×width×width×length). Data represent the geomean of tumour volume relative to the tumour volume on day of randomisation. Error bars are the 95% confidence interval (Graphpad Prism). This study demonstrated that Example 17 combined with either palbociclib (FIG. 15) or with vistusertib (AZD2014) (FIG. 16) gave a greater effect than either agent dosed alone.
According to a further aspect of the specification there is provided a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of the Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients for a tablet formulation include, for example, inert diluents, granulating and disintegrating agents, binding agents, lubricating agents, preservative agents and antioxidants. A further suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipient may be a chelating agent. Tablet formulations may be uncoated or coated either to modify their disintegration and the subsequent absorption of the active ingredient within the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve their stability and/or appearance, in either case, using conventional coating agents and procedures well known in the art.
Compositions for oral use may alternatively be in the form of hard gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, or as soft gelatin capsules in which the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil.
Aqueous suspensions generally contain the active ingredient in finely powdered form together with one or more suspending agents, dispersing or wetting agents. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, anti-oxidants, colouring agents, flavouring agents, and/or sweetening agents.
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil or in a mineral oil. The oily suspensions may also contain a thickening agent. Sweetening agents such as those set out above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant.
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water generally contain the active ingredient together with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives. Additional excipients such as sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.
The pharmaceutical compositions of the specification may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil or a mineral oil or a mixture of any of these. The emulsions may also contain sweetening, flavouring and preservative agents.
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, and may also contain a demulcent, preservative, flavouring and/or colouring agent.
The pharmaceutical compositions may also be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oily suspension, which may be formulated according to known procedures using one or more of the appropriate dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. A sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent system.
Compositions for administration by inhalation may be in the form of a conventional pressurised aerosol arranged to dispense the active ingredient either as an aerosol containing finely divided solid or liquid droplets. Conventional aerosol propellants such as volatile fluorinated hydrocarbons or hydrocarbons may be used and the aerosol device is conveniently arranged to dispense a metered quantity of active ingredient. Dry powder inhalers may also be suitable.
For further information on formulation the reader is referred to Chapter 25.2 in Volume 5 of Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry (Corwin Hansch; Chairman of Editorial Board), Pergamon Press 1990.
The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, oral administration to humans will generally require, for example, from 1 mg to 2 g of active agent (more suitably from 100 mg to 2 g, for example from 250 mg to 1.8 g, such as from 500 mg to 1.8 g, particularly from 500 mg to 1.5 g, conveniently from 500 mg to 1 g) to be administered compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 3 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition. It will be understood that, if a large dosage is required, multiple dosage forms may be required, for example two or more tablets or capsules, with the dose of active ingredient divided conveniently between them. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 10 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this specification, although a unit dosage form may contain up to 1 g. Conveniently, a single solid dosage form may contain between 1 and 300 mg of active ingredient.
The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of compounds of the present specification will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the disease state, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.
In using compounds of the present specification for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general, lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 1 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 1 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however preferred, particularly in tablet form.
In one aspect of the specification, compounds of the present specification or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are administered as tablets comprising 10 mg to 100 mg of the compound of the specification (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), wherein one or more tablets are administered as required to achieve the desired dose.
As stated above, it is known that signalling through ERα causes tumourigenesis by one or more of the effects of mediating proliferation of cancer and other cells, mediating angiogenic events and mediating the motility, migration and invasiveness of cancer cells. We have found that the compounds of the present specification possess potent anti-tumour activity which it is believed is obtained by way of antagonism and down-regulation of ERα that is involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation and survival of tumour cells and the invasiveness and migratory ability of metastasising tumour cells.
Accordingly, the compounds of the present specification may be of value as anti-tumour agents, in particular as selective inhibitors of the proliferation, survival, motility, dissemination and invasiveness of mammalian cancer cells leading to inhibition of tumour growth and survival and to inhibition of metastatic tumour growth. Particularly, the compounds of the present specification may be of value as anti-proliferative and anti-invasive agents in the containment and/or treatment of solid tumour disease. Particularly, the compounds of the present specification may be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours which are sensitive to inhibition of ERα and that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation and survival of tumour cells and the migratory ability and invasiveness of metastasising tumour cells. Further, the compounds of the present specification may be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours which are mediated alone or in part by antagonism and down-regulation of ERα, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an ERα inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment.

a) a compound of the Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in a first unit dosage form;b) an anti-tumour agent selected from an anti-tumour agent listed in (ii) above, an mTOR inhibitor (such as AZD2014), a PI3Kα-inhibitor, such as the compound 1-(4-(5-(5-amino-6-(5-tert-butyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)pyrazin-2-yl)-1-ethyl-1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-3-hydroxypropan-1-one, and a CDK4/6 inhibitor, such as palbociclib, in a second unit dosage form; andc) container means for containing said first and second dosage forms.
Combination therapy as described above may be added on top of standard of care therapy typically carried out according to its usual prescribing schedule.
Although the compounds of the Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), are primarily of value as therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful whenever it is required to inhibit ER-α. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents.
Personalised Healthcare
Another aspect of the present specification is based on identifying a link between the status of the gene encoding ERα and potential susceptibility to treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID). In particular, ERα gene status may indicate that a patient is less likely to respond to existing hormone therapy (such as aromatase inhibitors), in part at least because some ERα mutations are though to arise as resistance mechanisms to existing treatments. A SERD, particularly a SERD which can be administered orally in potentially larger doses without excessive inconvenience, may then advantageously be used to treat patients with ERα mutations who may be resistant to other therapies. This therefore provides opportunities, methods and tools for selecting patients for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), particularly cancer patients. The present specification relates to patient selection tools and methods (including personalised medicine). The selection is based on whether the tumour cells to be treated possess wild-type or mutant ERα gene. The ERα gene status could therefore be used as a biomarker to indicate that selecting treatment with a SERD may be advantageous. For the avoidance of doubt, compounds of the Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), as described herein, are thought to be similarly active against wild-type and mutant ERα genes, at least those mutations in ERα gene identified at the date of filing this application.
There is a clear need for biomarkers that will enrich for or select patients whose tumours will respond to treatment with a SERD, such as a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID). Patient selection biomarkers that identify the patients most likely to respond to one agent over another are ideal in the treatment of cancer, since they reduce the unnecessary treatment of patients with non-responding tumours to the potential side effects of such agents.
A biomarker can be described as “a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biologic processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention”. A biomarker is any identifiable and measurable indicator associated with a particular condition or disease where there is a correlation between the presence or level of the biomarker and some aspect of the condition or disease (including the presence of, the level or changing level of, the type of, the stage of, the susceptibility to the condition or disease, or the responsiveness to a drug used for treating the condition or disease). The correlation may be qualitative, quantitative, or both qualitative and quantitative. Typically a biomarker is a compound, compound fragment or group of compounds. Such compounds may be any compounds found in or produced by an organism, including proteins (and peptides), nucleic acids and other compounds.
Biomarkers may have a predictive power, and as such may be used to predict or detect the presence, level, type or stage of particular conditions or diseases (including the presence or level of particular microorganisms or toxins), the susceptibility (including genetic susceptibility) to particular conditions or diseases, or the response to particular treatments (including drug treatments). It is thought that biomarkers will play an increasingly important role in the future of drug discovery and development, by improving the efficiency of research and development programs. Biomarkers can be used as diagnostic agents, monitors of disease progression, monitors of treatment and predictors of clinical outcome. For example, various biomarker research projects are attempting to identify markers of specific cancers and of specific cardiovascular and immunological diseases. It is believed that the development of new validated biomarkers will lead both to significant reductions in healthcare and drug development costs and to significant improvements in treatment for a wide variety of diseases and conditions.
In order to optimally design clinical trials and to gain the most information from these trials, a biomarker may be required. The marker may be measurable in surrogate and tumour tissues. Ideally these markers will also correlate with efficacy and thus could ultimately be used for patient selection.
Thus, the technical problem underlying this aspect of the present specification is the identification of means for stratification of patients for treatment with a compound of Formula (I). The technical problem is solved by provision of the embodiments characterized in the claims and/or description herein.
Tumours which contain wild type ERα are believed to be susceptible to treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), for example as a first-line treatment. Tumours may also respond to treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) as a second-line, third-line or subsequent therapy and this may be useful, in particular, where the tumours contain mutant ERα and may thus be resistant to existing therapies such as AIs. A higher dosage of a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) may be required in the resistant setting than in wild type tumours).
The specification provides a method of determining sensitivity of cells to a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID). The method comprises determining the status of ERα gene in said cells. A cell is defined as sensitive to a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) if it inhibits the increase in cell number in a cell growth assay (either through inhibition of cell proliferation and/or through increased cell death). Methods of the specification are useful for predicting which cells are more likely to respond to a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) by growth inhibition.
A sample “representative of the tumour” can be the actual tumour sample isolated, or may be a sample that has been further processed, e.g. a sample of PCR amplified nucleic acid from the tumour sample.
Definitions
In this Personalised Healthcare section:
“Allele” refers to a particular form of a genetic locus, distinguished from other forms by its particular nucleotide or amino acid sequence.
“Amplification reactions” are nucleic acid reactions which result in specific amplification of target nucleic acids over non-target nucleic acids. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a well known amplification reaction.
“Cancer” is used herein to refer to neoplastic growth arising from cellular transformation to a neoplastic phenotype. Such cellular transformation often involves genetic mutation.
“Gene” is a segment of DNA that contains all the information for the regulated biosynthesis of an RNA product, including a promoter, exons, introns, and other sequence elements which may be located within 5' or 3' flanking regions (not within the transcribed portions of the gene) that control expression.
“Gene status” refers to whether the gene is wild type or not (i.e. mutant).
“Label” refers to a composition capable of producing a detectable signal indicative of the presence of the target polynucleotide in an assay sample. Suitable labels include radioisotopes, nucleotide chromophores, enzymes, substrates, fluorescent molecules, chemiluminescent moieties, magnetic particles, bioluminescent moieties, and the like. As such, a label is any composition detectable by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means.
“Non-synonymous variation” refers to a variation (variance) in or overlapping the coding sequence of a gene that result in the production of a distinct (altered) polypeptide sequence. These variations may or may not affect protein function and include missense variants (resulting in substitution of one amino acid for another), nonsense variants (resulting in a truncated polypeptide due to generation of a premature stop codon) and insertion/deletion variants.
“Synonymous variation” refers to a variation (variance) in the coding sequence of a gene that does not affect sequence of the encoded polypeptide. These variations may affect protein function indirectly (for example by altering expression of the gene), but, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, are generally assumed to be innocuous.
“Nucleic acid” refers to single stranded or double stranded DNA and RNA molecules including natural nucleic acids found in nature and/or modified, artificial nucleic acids having modified backbones or bases, as are known in the art.
“Primer” refers to a single stranded DNA oligonucleotide sequence capable of acting as a point of initiation for synthesis of a primer extension product which is complementary to the nucleic acid strand to be copied. The length and sequence of the primer must be such that they are able to prime the synthesis of extension products. A typical primer contains at least about 7 nucleotides in length of a sequence substantially complementary to the target sequence, but somewhat longer primers are preferred. Usually primers contain about 15-26 nucleotides, but longer or shorter primers may also be employed.
“Polymorphic site” is a position within a locus at which at least two alternative sequences are found in a population.
“Polymorphism” refers to the sequence variation observed in an individual at a polymorphic site. Polymorphisms include nucleotide substitutions, insertions, deletions and microsatellites and may, but need not, result in detectable differences in gene expression or protein function. In the absence of evidence of an effect on expression or protein function, common polymorphisms, including non-synonymous variants, are generally considered to be included in the definition of wild-type gene sequence. A catalog of human polymorphisms and associated annotation, including validation, observed frequencies, and disease association, is maintained by NCBI (dbSNP: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). Please note that the term “polymorphism” when used in the context of gene sequences should not be confused with the term “polymorphism” when used in the context of solid state form of a compound that is the crystalline or amorphous nature of a compound. The skilled person will understand the intended meaning by its context.
“Probe” refers to single stranded sequence-specific oligonucleotides which have a sequence that is exactly complementary to the target sequence of the allele to be detected.
“Response” is defined by measurements taken according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) involving the classification of patients into two main groups: those that show a partial response or stable disease and those that show signs of progressive disease.
“Stringent hybridisation conditions” refers to an overnight incubation at 42° C. in a solution comprising 50% formamide, 5×SSC (750 mM NaCl, 75 mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.6), 5×Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulphate, and 20 pg/mI denatured, sheared salmon sperm DNA, followed by washing the filters in 0.1×SSC at about 65° C.
“Survival” encompasses a patients' overall survival and progression-free survival.
“Overall survival” (OS) is defined as the time from the initiation of drug administration to death from any cause. “Progression-free survival” (PFS) is defined as the time from the initiation of drug administration to first appearance of progressive disease or death from any cause.
According to one aspect of the specification there is provided a method for selecting a patient for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), the method comprising providing a tumour cell containing sample from a patient; determining whether the ERα gene in the patient's tumour cell containing sample is wild type or mutant; and selecting a patient for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) based thereon.
The method may include or exclude the actual patient sample isolation step. Thus, according to one aspect of the specification there is provided a method for selecting a patient for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), the method comprising determining whether the ERα gene in a tumour cell containing sample previously isolated from the patient is wild type or mutant; and selecting a patient for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID) based thereon.
In one embodiment, the patient is selected for treatment with a compound of Formula (I) if the tumour cell DNA has a mutant ERα gene. In other embodiments, a patient whose tumour cell DNA possesses a wild type ERα gene is selected for treatment with a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID).
For the purpose of this specification, a gene status of wild-type is meant to indicate normal or appropriate expression of the gene and normal function of the encoded protein. In contrast, mutant status is meant to indicate expression of a protein with altered function, consistent with the known roles of mutant ERα genes in cancer (as described herein). Any number of genetic or epigenetic alterations, including but not limited to mutation, amplification, deletion, genomic rearrangement, or changes in methylation profile, may result in a mutant status. However, if such alterations nevertheless result in appropriate expression of the normal protein, or a functionally equivalent variant, then the gene status is regarded as wild-type. Examples of variants that typically would not result in a functional mutant gene status include synonymous coding variants and common polymorphisms (synonymous or non-synonymous). As discussed below, gene status can be assessed by a functional assay, or it may be inferred from the nature of detected deviations from a reference sequence.
In certain embodiments the wild-type or mutant status of the ERα gene is determined by the presence or absence of non-synonymous nucleic acid variations in the genes. Observed non-synonymous variations corresponding to known common polymorphisms with no annotated functional effects do not contribute to a gene status of mutant.
Other variations in the ERα gene that signify mutant status include splice site variations that decrease recognition of an intron/exon junction during processing of pre-mRNA to mRNA. This can result in exon skipping or the inclusion of normally intronic sequence in spliced mRNA (intron retention or utilization of cryptic splice junctions). This can, in turn, result in the production of aberrant protein with insertions and/or deletions relative to the normal protein. Thus, in other embodiments, the gene has a mutant status if there is a variant that alters splice site recognition sequence at an intron/exon junction.
For ESR1, reference sequences are available for the gene (GenBank accession number: NG_008493), mRNA (GenBank accession number: NM_000125), and protein (GenBank accession number: NP_000116 or Swiss-Prot accession: P03372). A person of skill in the art will be able to determine the ESR1 gene status, i.e. whether a particular ESR1 gene is wild type or mutant, based on comparison of DNA or protein sequence with wild type.
It will be apparent that the gene and mRNA sequences disclosed for ERα gene are representative sequences. In normal individuals there are two copies of each gene, a maternal and paternal copy, which will likely have some sequence differences, moreover within a population there will exist numerous allelic variants of the gene sequence. Other sequences regarded as wild type include those that possess one or more synonymous changes to the nucleic acid sequence (which changes do not alter the encoded protein sequence), non-synonymous common polymorphisms (e.g. germ-line polymorphisms) which alter the protein sequence but do not affect protein function, and intronic non-splice-site sequence changes.
There are numerous techniques available to the person skilled in the art to determine the gene status of ERα. The gene status can be determined by determination of the nucleic acid sequence. This could be via direct sequencing of the full-length gene or analysis of specific sites within the gene, e.g. commonly mutated sites.
Samples
The patient's sample to be tested for the gene status can be any tumour tissue or tumour-cell containing sample obtained or obtainable from the individual. The test sample is conveniently a sample of blood, mouth swab, biopsy, or other body fluid or tissue obtained from an individual. Particular examples include: circulating tumour cells, circulating DNA in the plasma or serum, cells isolated from the ascites fluid of ovarian cancer patients, lung sputum for patients with tumours within the lung, a fine needle aspirate from a breast cancer patient, urine, peripheral blood, a cell scraping, a hair follicle, a skin punch or a buccal sample.
It will be appreciated that the test sample may equally be a nucleic acid sequence corresponding to the sequence in the test sample, that is to say that all or a part of the region in the sample nucleic acid may firstly be amplified using any convenient technique e.g. polymerase chain reaction (PCR), before analysis. The nucleic acid may be genomic DNA or fractionated or whole cell RNA. In particular embodiments the RNA is whole cell RNA and is used directly as the template for labelling a first strand cDNA using random primers or poly A primers. The nucleic acid or protein in the test sample may be extracted from the sample according to standard methodologies (see Green & Sambrook, Eds., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, (2012, 4th edition, Vol. 1-3, ISBN 9781936113422), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.)
The diagnostic methods of the specification can be undertaken using a sample previously taken from the individual or patient. Such samples may be preserved by freezing or fixed and embedded in formalin-paraffin or other media. Alternatively, a fresh tumour cell containing sample may be obtained and used.
The methods of the specification can be applied using cells from any tumour. Suitable tumours for treatment with a compound of Formula (I) have been described hereinbefore.
Methods for Detection of Nucleic Acids
The detection of mutant ERα nucleic acids can be employed, in the context of the present specification, to select drug treatment. Since mutations in these genes occur at the DNA level, the methods of the specification can be based on detection of mutations or variances in genomic DNA, as well as transcripts and proteins themselves. It can be desirable to confirm mutations in genomic DNA by analysis of transcripts and/or polypeptides, in order to ensure that the detected mutation is indeed expressed in the subject.
It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that there are a large number of analytical procedures which may be used to detect the presence or absence of variant nucleotides at one or more positions in a gene. In general, the detection of allelic variation requires a mutation discrimination technique, optionally an amplification reaction (such as one based on polymerase chain reaction) and optionally a signal generation system. There are a multitude of mutation detection techniques available in the art and these may be used in combination with a signal generation system, of which there are numerous available in the art. Many methods for the detection of allelic variation are reviewed by Nollau et al., Clin. Chem., 1997, 43, 1114-1120; Anderson S M. Expert Rev Mol Diagn., 2011, 11, 635-642; Meyerson M. et al., Nat Rev Genet., 2010, 11, 685-696; and in standard textbooks, for example “Laboratory Protocols for Mutation Detection”, Ed. by U. Landegren, Oxford University Press, 1996 and “PCR”, 2nd Edition by Newton & Graham, BIOS Scientific Publishers Limited, 1997.
As noted above, determining the presence or absence of a particular variance or plurality of variances in the ERα gene in a patient with cancer can be performed in a variety of ways. Such tests are commonly performed using DNA or RNA collected from biological samples, e.g., tissue biopsies, urine, stool, sputum, blood, cells, tissue scrapings, breast aspirates or other cellular materials, and can be performed by a variety of methods including, but not limited to, PCR, hybridization with allele-specific probes, enzymatic mutation detection, chemical cleavage of mismatches, mass spectrometry or DNA sequencing, including minisequencing.
Suitable mutation detection techniques include amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS™), amplification refractory mutation system linear extension (ALEX™), competitive oligonucleotide priming system (COPS), Taqman, Molecular Beacons, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), and restriction site based PCR and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques.
In particular embodiments the method employed for determining the nucleotide(s) within a biomarker gene is selected from: allele-specific amplification (allele specific PCR)-such as amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), sequencing, allelic discrimination assay, hybridisation, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA).
In particular embodiments, hybridization with allele specific probes can be conducted by: (1) allele specific oligonucleotides bound to a solid phase (e.g. glass, silicon, nylon membranes) with the labelled sample in solution, for example as in many DNA chip applications; or, (2) bound sample (often cloned DNA or PCR amplified DNA) and labelled oligonucleotides in solution (either allele specific or short so as to allow sequencing by hybridization). Diagnostic tests may involve a panel of variances, often on a solid support, which enables the simultaneous determination of more than one variance. Such hybridization probes are well known in the art (see, e.g., Green & Sambrook, Eds., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, (2012, 4th edition, Vol. 1-3, ISBN 9781936113422), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) and may span two or more variance sites.
Thus, in one embodiment, the detection of the presence or absence of at least one mutation provides for contacting ERα nucleic acid containing a putative mutation site with at least one nucleic acid probe. The probe preferentially hybridizes with a nucleic acid sequence including a variance site and containing complementary nucleotide bases at the variance site under selective hybridization conditions. Hybridization can be detected with a detectable label using labels known to one skilled in the art. Such labels include, but are not limited to radioactive, fluorescent, dye, and enzymatic labels.
In another embodiment, the detection of the presence or absence of at least one mutation provides for contacting ERα nucleic acid containing a putative mutation site with at least one nucleic acid primer. The primer preferentially hybridizes with a nucleic acid sequence including a variance site and containing complementary nucleotide bases at the variance site under selective hybridization conditions.
Oligonucleotides used as primers for specific amplification may carry the complementary nucleotide base to the mutation of interest in the centre of the molecule (so that amplification depends on differential hybridization; see, e.g., Gibbs, et al., 1989. Nucl. Acids Res., 17, 2437-248) or at the extreme 3'-terminus of one primer where, under appropriate conditions, mismatch can prevent, or reduce polymerase extension (see, e.g., Prossner, 1993, Tibtech, 11 238).
In yet another embodiment, the detection of the presence or absence of at least one mutation comprises sequencing at least one nucleic acid sequence and comparing the obtained sequence with the known wild type nucleic acid sequence.
Alternatively, the presence or absence of at least one mutation comprises mass spectrometric determination of at least one nucleic acid sequence.
In one embodiment, the detection of the presence or absence of at least one nucleic acid variance comprises performing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The target nucleic acid sequence containing the hypothetical variance is amplified and the nucleotide sequence of the amplified nucleic acid is determined. Determining the nucleotide sequence of the amplified nucleic acid comprises sequencing at least one nucleic acid segment. Alternatively, amplification products can be analysed using any method capable of separating the amplification products according to their size, including automated and manual gel electrophoresis, and the like.
Mutations in genomic nucleic acid are advantageously detected by techniques based on mobility shift in amplified nucleic acid fragments. For instance, Chen et al., Anal Biochem 1996, 239, 61-9, describe the detection of single-base mutations by a competitive mobility shift assay. Moreover, assays based on the technique of Marcelino et al., BioTechniques 1999, 26, 1134-1148 are available commercially.
In a particular example, capillary heteroduplex analysis may be used to detect the presence of mutations based on mobility shift of duplex nucleic acids in capillary systems as a result of the presence of mismatches.
Generation of nucleic acids for analysis from samples generally requires nucleic acid amplification. Many amplification methods rely on an enzymatic chain reaction (such as a polymerase chain reaction, a ligase chain reaction, or a self-sustained sequence replication) or from the replication of all or part of the vector into which it has been cloned. Preferably, the amplification according to the specification is an exponential amplification, as exhibited by for example the polymerase chain reaction.
Many target and signal amplification methods have been described in the literature, for example, general reviews of these methods in Landegren, U., et al., Science, 1988 242, 229-237 and Lewis, R., Genetic Engineering News 1990, 10, 54-55. These amplification methods can be used in the methods of our specification, and include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), PCR in situ, ligase amplification reaction (LAR), ligase hybridisation, Q3 bacteriophage replicase, transcription-based amplification system (TAS), genomic amplification with transcript sequencing (GAWTS), nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) and in situ hybridisation. Primers suitable for use in various amplification techniques can be prepared according to methods known in the art.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) PCR is a nucleic acid amplification method described inter alia in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,683,195 and 4,683,202. PCR consists of repeated cycles of DNA polymerase generated primer extension reactions. The target DNA is heat denatured and two oligonucleotides, which bracket the target sequence on opposite strands of the DNA to be amplified, are hybridised. These oligonucleotides become primers for use with DNA polymerase. The DNA is copied by primer extension to make a second copy of both strands. By repeating the cycle of heat denaturation, primer hybridisation and extension, the target DNA can be amplified a million fold or more in about two to four hours. PCR is a molecular biology tool, which must be used in conjunction with a detection technique to determine the results of amplification. An advantage of PCR is that it increases sensitivity by amplifying the amount of target DNA by 1 million to 1 billion fold in approximately 4 hours. PCR can be used to amplify any known nucleic acid in a diagnostic context (Mok et al., Gynaecologic Oncology, 1994, 52: 247-252,).
An allele specific amplification technique such as Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS™) (Newton et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 1989, 17, 2503-2516) can also be used to detect single base mutations. Under the appropriate PCR amplification conditions a single base mismatch located at the 3'-end of the primer is sufficient for preferential amplification of the perfectly matched allele (Newton et al., 1989, supra), allowing the discrimination of closely related species. The basis of an amplification system using the primers described above is that oligonucleotides with a mismatched 3'-residue will not function as primers in the PCR under appropriate conditions. This amplification system allows genotyping solely by inspection of reaction mixtures after agarose gel electrophoresis.
Analysis of amplification products can be performed using any method capable of separating the amplification products according to their size, including automated and manual gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and the like.
The methods of nucleic acid isolation, amplification and analysis are routine for one skilled in the art and examples of protocols can be found, for example, Green & Sambrook, Eds., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, (2012, 4th edition, Vol. 1-3, ISBN 9781936113422), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.) Particularly useful protocol source for methods used in PCR amplification is PCR (Basics: From Background to Bench) by M. J. McPherson, S. G. Mailer, R. Beynon, C. Howe, Springer Verlag; 1st edition (Oct. 15, 2000), ISBN: 0387916008.
The present specification also provides predictive and diagnostic kits comprising degenerate primers to amplify a target nucleic acid in the ERα gene and instructions comprising; amplification protocol and analysis of the results. The kit may alternatively also comprise buffers, enzymes, and containers for performing the amplification and analysis of the amplification products. The kit may also be a component of a screening, or diagnostic kit comprising other tools such as DNA microarrays, or other supports. Preferably, the kit also provides one or more control templates, such as nucleic acids isolated from normal tissue sample, and/or a series of samples representing different variances in the reference genes.
In one embodiment, the kit provides two or more primer pairs, each pair capable of amplifying a different region of the reference (ERα) gene (each region a site of potential variance) thereby providing a kit for analysis of expression of several gene variances in a biological sample in one reaction or several parallel reactions.
Primers in the kits may be labelled, for example fluorescently labelled, to facilitate detection of the amplification products and consequent analysis of the nucleic acid variances. The kit may also allow for more than one variance to be detected in one analysis. A combination kit will therefore comprise of primers capable of amplifying different segments of the reference gene. The primers may be differentially labelled, for example using different fluorescent labels, so as to differentiate between the variances.
In another aspect, the specification provides a method of treating a patient suffering from cancer comprising: determining the mutant or wild type status of the ERα gene in the patient's tumour cells and if the ERα gene is mutant, administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID).
As used herein, the terms “effective” and “effectiveness” includes both pharmacological effectiveness and physiological safety. Pharmacological effectiveness refers to the ability of the treatment to result in a desired biological effect in the patient. Physiological safety refers to the level of toxicity, or other adverse physiological effects at the cellular, organ and/or organism level (often referred to as side-effects) resulting from administration of the treatment. “Less effective” means that the treatment results in a therapeutically significant lower level of pharmacological effectiveness and/or a therapeutically greater level of adverse physiological effects.
According to another aspect of the specification there is provided the use of a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof to treat a cancer patient whose tumour cells have been identified as possessing a mutant ERα gene.
According to another aspect of the specification there is provided a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof for treating cancers with tumour cells identified as harbouring mutant ERα gene.
According to another aspect of the specification there is provided a method of treating cancers with tumour cells identified as harbouring mutant ERα gene comprising administering an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In still further embodiments, the specification relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula (I), (IA), (IB), (IC) or (ID), for use in the prevention and treatment of cancer with tumour cells identified as harbouring a mutant ERα gene.
For all the aspects above, mutant forms of ERα determined/identified are at all positions across the gene.
For all the aspects above, using tumours such as breast cancer as an example, particular mutant forms of ERα determined/identified are those at positions Ser463Pro, Val543Glu, Leu536Arg, Tyr537Ser, Tyr537Asn and Asp538Gly.

The residue was then added to a separate flask containing a suspension of tert-butyl azetidin-3-ylcarbamate (1.94 g, 11.25 mmol) and DIPEA (3.24 ml, 18.75 mmol) in dioxane/DCM (1:1, 40 mL) and the reaction was stirred at room temperature (exothermic on addition of triflate). The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and washed with NH4Cl solution. The organic layer was dried and evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude product. The crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 10% 1M NH3/MeOH in DCM. Pure fractions were evaporated to dryness to afford tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate (2.82 g, 97%) as a mauve oil 1H NMR as above.
Preparation of 1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine
Trifluroacetic acid (39.8 mL, 517 mmol) was added dropwise over 30 minutes to a solution of tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate (20.0 g, 86 mmol) in DCM (67.8 mL) that had been immersed in a water bath. After 18 hours, the reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure to an orange oil. This oil was dissolved in 10% methanol in DCM (125 mL) and potassium carbonate (71.4 g, 517 mmol) was added with vigorous stirring. After 15 min, another 30 g of potassium carbonate were added. Stirring became sluggish, and Celite was added (˜15 g). Stirring was continued for another 15 minutes, and the mixture was filtered with a 10% methanol in DCM wash. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (pressure: 100 mbar, water bath temperature: 30° C.), and the resulting orange oil was purified by flash silica chromatography (λ detection=210 nm), elution gradient 0 to 15% (2 M ammonia in methanol) in DCM to afford 1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (12.8 g) contaminated with 28 wt % methanol based on NMR integration as a yellow oil. This material could be used directly, stored in the freezer for later use, or further purified by vacuum distillation as according to the following example: 1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (14.8 g) as a light yellow oil was distilled using a short path distillation apparatus with jacketed water cooling under vacuum (vacuum pump) conditions. The flask containing the amine was immersed in an oil bath, and the bath temperature was gradually increased to 140° C. over a period of 30 minutes. Distillation occurred with a bath temperature of 110-135° C. and an approximate head temperature of 70° C. to afford 1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (12.4 g, 84%) as a clear colorless oil. This oil was stored in the freezer before use. 1H NMR (300 MHz, DMSO-d6, 27° C.) 1.52-1.70 (2H, m), 1.75 (2H, br s), 2.38 (2H, t), 2.43-2.48 (2H, m), 3.27-3.39 (1H, m), 3.42-3.48 (2H, m), 4.43 (2H, dt). m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 133.
