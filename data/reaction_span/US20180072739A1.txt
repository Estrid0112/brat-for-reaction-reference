FIELD OF THE INVENTION
Disclosed are co-crystals of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor 1-((R)-3-(4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one, as well as pharmaceutical compositions that include the Btk inhibitor co-crystals and methods of using the Btk inhibitor co-crystals in the treatment of diseases or conditions that would benefit from inhibition of Btk activity.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a member of the Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, is a key signaling enzyme expressed in all hematopoietic cells types except T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Btk plays an essential role in the B-cell signaling pathway linking cell surface B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation to downstream intracellular responses.
Btk is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival. In addition, Btk plays a role in a number of other hematopoetic cell signaling pathways, e.g., Toll like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-α production in macrophages, IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) signaling in Mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation.

B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (BCLDs) are neoplasms of the blood and encompass, inter alia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia. BCLDs can originate either in the lymphatic tissues (as in the case of lymphoma) or in the bone marrow (as in the case of leukemia and myeloma), and they all are involved with the uncontrolled growth of lymphocytes or white blood cells. There are many subtypes of BCLD, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The disease course and treatment of BCLD is dependent on the BCLD subtype; however, even within each subtype the clinical presentation, morphologic appearance, and response to therapy is heterogeneous.
Malignant lymphomas are neoplastic transformations of cells that reside predominantly within lymphoid tissues. Two groups of malignant lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Both types of lymphomas infiltrate reticuloendothelial tissues. However, they differ in the neoplastic cell of origin, site of disease, presence of systemic symptoms, and response to treatment (Freedman et al., “Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas” Chapter 134, Cancer Medicine, (an approved publication of the American Cancer Society, B.C. Decker Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, 2003).
Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. In some embodiments, the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma, relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, or relapsed or refractory CLL.
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) are a diverse group of malignancies that are predominately of B-cell origin. NHL may develop in any organs associated with lymphatic system such as spleen, lymph nodes or tonsils and can occur at any age. NHL is often marked by enlarged lymph nodes, fever, and weight loss. NHL is classified as either B-cell or T-cell NHL. Lymphomas related to lymphoproliferative disorders following bone marrow or stem cell transplantation are usually B-cell NHL. In the Working Formulation classification scheme, NHL has been divided into low-, intermediate-, and high-grade categories by virtue of their natural histories (see “The Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Pathologic Classification Project,” Cancer 49(1982):2112-2135). The low-grade lymphomas are indolent, with a median survival of 5 to 10 years (Horning and Rosenberg (1984) N. Engl. J. Med. 311:1471-1475). Although chemotherapy can induce remissions in the majority of indolent lymphomas, cures are rare and most patients eventually relapse, requiring further therapy. The intermediate- and high-grade lymphomas are more aggressive tumors, but they have a greater chance for cure with chemotherapy. However, a significant proportion of these patients will relapse and require further treatment.
A non-limiting list of the B-cell NHL includes Burkitt's lymphoma (e.g., Endemic Burkitt's Lymphoma and Sporadic Burkitt's Lymphoma), Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma, Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL), Diffuse Mixed Small and Large Cell Lymphoma, Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell, Diffuse Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Follicular Small Cleaved Cell (Grade 1), Follicular Mixed Small Cleaved and Large Cell (Grade 2), Follicular Large Cell (Grade 3), Intravascular Large B-Cell Lymphoma, Intravascular Lymphomatosis, Large Cell Immunoblastic Lymphoma, Large Cell Lymphoma (LCL), Lymphoblastic Lymphoma, MALT Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL), immunoblastic large cell lymphoma, precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, lymphoplasmocytic lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, and primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Additional non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are contemplated within the scope of the present invention and apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.
DLBCL
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a DLCBL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory DLCBL in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
As used herein, the term “Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)” refers to a neoplasm of the germinal center B lymphocytes with a diffuse growth pattern and a high-intermediate proliferation index. DLBCLs represent approximately 30% of all lymphomas and may present with several morphological variants including the centroblastic, immunoblastic, T-cell/histiocyte rich, anaplastic and plasmoblastic subtypes. Genetic tests have shown that there are different subtypes of DLBCL. In some embodiments, DLBCL is further divided into subtypes: activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (GCB DLBCL), and Double-Hit (DH) DLBCL. In some embodiments, ABC-DLBCL is characterized by a CD79B mutation. In some embodiments, ABC-DLBCL is characterized by a CD79A mutation. In some embodiments, the ABC-DLBCL is characterized by a mutation in MyD88, A20, or a combination thereof. These subtypes seem to have different outlooks (prognoses) and responses to treatment. DLBCL can affect any age group but occurs mostly in older people (the average age is mid-60s).
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, activated B cell-like subtype (ABC-DLBCL), in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an irreversible Btk inhibitor in an amount from 300 mg/day up to, and including, 1000 mg/day. The ABC subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL) is thought to arise from post germinal center B cells that are arrested during plasmatic differentiation. The ABC subtype of DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) accounts for approximately 30% total DLBCL diagnoses. It is considered the least curable of the DLBCL molecular subtypes and, as such, patients diagnosed with the ABC-DLBCL typically display significantly reduced survival rates compared with individuals with other types of DLCBL. ABC-DLBCL is most commonly associated with chromosomal translocations deregulating the germinal center master regulator BCL6 and with mutations inactivating the PRDM1 gene, which encodes a transcriptional repressor required for plasma cell differentiation.
A particularly relevant signaling pathway in the pathogenesis of ABC-DLBCL is the one mediated by the nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription complex. The NF-κB family comprises 5 members (p50, p52, p65, c-rel and RelB) that form homo- and heterodimers and function as transcriptional factors to mediate a variety of proliferation, apoptosis, inflammatory and immune responses and are critical for normal B-cell development and survival. NF-κB is widely used by eukaryotic cells as a regulator of genes that control cell proliferation and cell survival. As such, many different types of human tumors have misregulated NF-κB: that is, NF-κB is constitutively active. Active NF-κB turns on the expression of genes that keep the cell proliferating and protect the cell from conditions that would otherwise cause it to die via apoptosis.
The dependence of ABC DLBCLs on NF-κB depends on a signaling pathway upstream of IkB kinase comprised of CARD11, BCL10 and MALT1 (the CBM complex). Interference with the CBM pathway extinguishes NF-κB signaling in ABC DLBCL cells and induces apoptosis. The molecular basis for constitutive activity of the NF-κB pathway is a subject of current investigation but some somatic alterations to the genome of ABC DLBCLs clearly invoke this pathway. For example, somatic mutations of the coiled-coil domain of CARD11 in DLBCL render this signaling scaffold protein able to spontaneously nucleate protein-protein interaction with MALT1 and BCL10, causing IKK activity and NF-κB activation. Constitutive activity of the B cell receptor signaling pathway has been implicated in the activation of NF-κB in ABC DLBCLs with wild type CARD11, and this is associated with mutations within the cytoplasmic tails of the B cell receptor subunits CD79A and CD79B. Oncogenic activating mutations in the signaling adapter MYD88 activate NF-κB and synergize with B cell receptor signaling in sustaining the survival of ABC DLBCL cells. In addition, inactivating mutations in a negative regulator of the NF-κB pathway, A20, occur almost exclusively in ABC DLBCL.
Indeed, genetic alterations affecting multiple components of the NF-κB signaling pathway have been recently identified in more than 50% of ABC-DLBCL patients, where these lesions promote constitutive NF-κB activation, thereby contributing to lymphoma growth. These include mutations of CARD11 (˜10% of the cases), a lymphocyte-specific cytoplasmic scaffolding protein that-together with MALT1 and BCL10-forms the BCR signalosome, which relays signals from antigen receptors to the downstream mediators of NF-κB activation. An even larger fraction of cases (˜30%) carry biallelic genetic lesions inactivating the negative NF-κB regulator A20. Further, high levels of expression of NF-κB target genes have been observed in ABC-DLBCL tumor samples. See, e.g., U. Klein et al., (2008), Nature Reviews Immunology 8:22-23; R. E. Davis et al., (2001), Journal of Experimental Medicine 194:1861-1874; G. Lentz et al., (2008), Science 319:1676-1679; M. Compagno et al., (2009), Nature 459:712-721; and L. Srinivasan et al., (2009), Cell 139:573-586).
DLBCL cells of the ABC subtype, such as OCI-Ly10, have chronic active BCR signaling and are very sensitive to the Btk inhibitor described herein. The irreversible Btk inhibitor described herein potently and irreversibly inhibits the growth of OCI-Ly10 (EC50 continuous exposure=10 nM, EC50 1 hour pulse=50 nM). In addition, induction of apoptosis, as shown by capsase activation, Annexin-V flow cytometry and increase in sub-GO fraction is observed in OCILy10. Both sensitive and resistant cells express Btk at similar levels, and the active site of Btk is fully occupied by the inhibitor in both as shown using a fluorescently labeled affinity probe. OCI-Ly10 cells are shown to have chronically active BCR signaling to NF-κB which is dose dependently inhibited by the Btk inhibitors described herein. The activity of Btk inhibitors in the cell lines studied herein are also characterized by comparing signal transduction profiles (Btk, PLCγ, ERK, NF-κB, AKT), cytokine secretion profiles and mRNA expression profiles, both with and without BCR stimulation, and observed significant differences in these profiles that lead to clinical biomarkers that identify the most sensitive patient populations to Btk inhibitor treatment.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) are commonly thought as the same disease with slightly different manifestations. Where the cancerous cells gather determines whether it is called CLL or SLL. When the cancer cells are primarily found in the lymph nodes, lima bean shaped structures of the lymphatic system (a system primarily of tiny vessels found in the body), it is called SLL. SLL accounts for about 5% to 10% of all lymphomas. When most of the cancer cells are in the bloodstream and the bone marrow, it is called CLL.
Both CLL and SLL are slow-growing diseases, although CLL, which is much more common, tends to grow slower. CLL and SLL are treated the same way. They are usually not considered curable with standard treatments, but depending on the stage and growth rate of the disease, most patients live longer than 10 years. Occasionally over time, these slow-growing lymphomas may transform into a more aggressive type of lymphoma.
Chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) is the most common type of leukemia. It is estimated that 100,760 people in the United States are living with or are in remission from CLL. Most (>75%) people newly diagnosed with CLL are over the age of 50. Currently CLL treatment focuses on controlling the disease and its symptoms rather than on an outright cure. CLL is treated by chemotherapy, radiation therapy, biological therapy, or bone marrow transplantation. Symptoms are sometimes treated surgically (splenectomy removal of enlarged spleen) or by radiation therapy (“de-bulking” swollen lymph nodes). Though CLL progresses slowly in most cases, it is considered generally incurable. Certain CLLs are classified as high-risk. As used herein, “high risk CLL” means CLL characterized by at least one of the following 1) 17p13−; 2) 11q22−; 3) unmutated IgVH together with ZAP-70+ and/or CD38+; or 4) trisomy 12.
CLL treatment is typically administered when the patient's clinical symptoms or blood counts indicate that the disease has progressed to a point where it may affect the patient's quality of life.
Small lymphocytic leukemia (SLL) is very similar to CLL described supra, and is also a cancer of B-cells. In SLL the abnormal lymphocytes mainly affect the lymph nodes. However, in CLL the abnormal cells mainly affect the blood and the bone marrow. The spleen may be affected in both conditions. SLL accounts for about 1 in 25 of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It can occur at any time from young adulthood to old age, but is rare under the age of 50. SLL is considered an indolent lymphoma. This means that the disease progresses very slowly, and patients tend to live many years after diagnosis. However, most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, and although SLL responds well to a variety of chemotherapy drugs, it is generally considered to be incurable. Although some cancers tend to occur more often in one gender or the other, cases and deaths due to SLL are evenly split between men and women. The average age at the time of diagnosis is 60 years.
Although SLL is indolent, it is persistently progressive. The usual pattern of this disease is one of high response rates to radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, with a period of disease remission. This is followed months or years later by an inevitable relapse. Re-treatment leads to a response again, but again the disease will relapse. This means that although the short-term prognosis of SLL is quite good, over time, many patients develop fatal complications of recurrent disease. Considering the age of the individuals typically diagnosed with CLL and SLL, there is a need in the art for a simple and effective treatment of the disease with minimum side-effects that do not impede on the patient's quality of life. The instant invention fulfills this long standing need in the art.
Mantle Cell Lymphoma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Mantle cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory Mantle cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
As used herein, the term, “Mantle cell lymphoma” refers to a subtype of B-cell lymphoma, due to CD5 positive antigen-naive pregerminal center B-cell within the mantle zone that surrounds normal germinal center follicles. MCL cells generally over-express cyclin D1 due to a t(11:14) chromosomal translocation in the DNA. More specifically, the translocation is at t(11;14)(q13;q32). Only about 5% of lymphomas are of this type. The cells are small to medium in size. Men are affected most often. The average age of patients is in the early 60s. The lymphoma is usually widespread when it is diagnosed, involving lymph nodes, bone marrow, and, very often, the spleen. Mantle cell lymphoma is not a very fast growing lymphoma, but is difficult to treat.
Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
As used herein, the term “marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to a group of related B-cell neoplasms that involve the lymphoid tissues in the marginal zone, the patchy area outside the follicular mantle zone. Marginal zone lymphomas account for about 5% to 10% of lymphomas. The cells in these lymphomas look small under the microscope. There are 3 main types of marginal zone lymphomas including extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas, nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma.
MALT

Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory MALT in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
The term “mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma”, as used herein, refers to extranodal manifestations of marginal-zone lymphomas. Most MALT lymphoma are a low grade, although a minority either manifest initially as intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) or evolve from the low-grade form. Most of the MALT lymphoma occur in the stomach, and roughly 70% of gastric MALT lymphoma are associated with Helicobacter pylori infection. Several cytogenetic abnormalities have been identified, the most common being trisomy 3 or t(11;18). Many of these other MALT lymphoma have also been linked to infections with bacteria or viruses. The average age of patients with MALT lymphoma is about 60.
Nodal Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
The term “nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to an indolent B-cell lymphoma that is found mostly in the lymph nodes. The disease is rare and only accounts for 1% of all Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas (NHL). It is most commonly diagnosed in older patients, with women more susceptible than men. The disease is classified as a marginal zone lymphoma because the mutation occurs in the marginal zone of the B-cells. Due to its confinement in the lymph nodes, this disease is also classified as nodal.
Splenic Marginal Zone B-Cell Lymphoma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
The term “splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma” refers to specific low-grade small B-cell lymphoma that is incorporated in the World Health Organization classification. Characteristic features are splenomegaly, moderate lymphocytosis with villous morphology, intrasinusoidal pattern of involvement of various organs, especially bone marrow, and relative indolent course. Tumor progression with increase of blastic forms and aggressive behavior are observed in a minority of patients. Molecular and cytogenetic studies have shown heterogeneous results probably because of the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria.
Burkitt Lymphoma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Burkitt lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory Burkitt lymphoma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
The term “Burkitt lymphoma” refers to a type of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that commonly affects children. It is a highly aggressive type of B-cell lymphoma that often starts and involves body parts other than lymph nodes. In spite of its fast-growing nature, Burkitt's lymphoma is often curable with modern intensive therapies. There are two broad types of Burkitt's lymphoma-the sporadic and the endemic varieties:
Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma: The disease involves children much more than adults, and is related to Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) infection in 95% cases. It occurs primarily is equatorial Africa, where about half of all childhood cancers are Burkitt's lymphoma. It characteristically has a high chance of involving the jawbone, a rather distinctive feature that is rare in sporadic Burkitt's. It also commonly involves the abdomen.
Sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma: The type of Burkitt's lymphoma that affects the rest of the world, including Europe and the Americas is the sporadic type. Here too, it's mainly a disease in children. The link between Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) is not as strong as with the endemic variety, though direct evidence of EBV infection is present in one out of five patients. More than the involvement of lymph nodes, it is the abdomen that is notably affected in more than 90% of the children. Bone marrow involvement is more common than in the sporadic variety.
Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
The term “Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia”, also known as lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, is cancer involving a subtype of white blood cells called lymphocytes. It is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes. It is also characterized by the lymphoma cells making an antibody called immunoglobulin M (IgM). The IgM antibodies circulate in the blood in large amounts, and cause the liquid part of the blood to thicken, like syrup. This can lead to decreased blood flow to many organs, which can cause problems with vision (because of poor circulation in blood vessels in the back of the eyes) and neurological problems (such as headache, dizziness, and confusion) caused by poor blood flow within the brain. Other symptoms can include feeling tired and weak, and a tendency to bleed easily. The underlying etiology is not fully understood but a number of risk factors have been identified, including the locus 6p21.3 on chromosome 6. There is a 2- to 3-fold risk increase of developing WM in people with a personal history of autoimmune diseases with autoantibodies and particularly elevated risks associated with hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus, and rickettsiosis.
Multiple Myeloma
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a myeloma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory myeloma in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
Multiple myeloma, also known as MM, myeloma, plasma cell myeloma, or as Kahler's disease (after Otto Kahler) is a cancer of the white blood cells known as plasma cells. A type of B cell, plasma cells are a crucial part of the immune system responsible for the production of antibodies in humans and other vertebrates. They are produced in the bone marrow and are transported through the lymphatic system.
Leukemia
Disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating a leukemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Further disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating relapsed or refractory leukemia in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual a therapeutically-effective amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1.
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of blood cells, usually leukocytes (white blood cells). Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases. The first division is between its acute and chronic forms: (i) acute leukemia is characterized by the rapid increase of immature blood cells. This crowding makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells. Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemia due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body. Acute forms of leukemia are the most common forms of leukemia in children; (ii) chronic leukemia is distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, white blood cells. Typically taking months or years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood. Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group. Additionally, the diseases are subdivided according to which kind of blood cell is affected. This split divides leukemias into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias and myeloid or myelogenous leukemias: (i) lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes, which are infection-fighting immune system cells; (ii) myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, the cancerous change takes place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red blood cells, some other types of white cells, and platelets.
Within these main categories, there are several subcategories including, but not limited to, Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-ALL; also called precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia), Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and Hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Accordingly, disclosed herein, in certain embodiments, is a method for treating Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-ALL; also called precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia), Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) in an individual in need thereof, comprising: administering to the individual an amount of a co-crystal of Compound 1. In some embodiments, the leukemia is a relapsed or refractory leukemia. In some embodiments, the leukemia is a relapsed or refractory Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), relapsed or refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (precursor B-ALL; also called precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia), relapsed or refractory Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), relapsed or refractory Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), or relapsed or refractory Hairy cell leukemia (HCL).
Symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognostic tests for each of the above-mentioned conditions are known. See, e.g., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine©,” 16th ed., 2004, The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Dey et al. (2006), Cytojournal 3(24), and the “Revised European American Lymphoma” (REAL) classification system (see, e.g., the website maintained by the National Cancer Institute).
A number of animal models of are useful for establishing a range of therapeutically effective doses of irreversible Btk inhibitor compounds, such as a co-crystal of Compound 1, for treating any of the foregoing diseases.
The therapeutic efficacy of Compound 1 for any one of the foregoing diseases can be optimized during a course of treatment. For example, a subject being treated can undergo a diagnostic evaluation to correlate the relief of disease symptoms or pathologies to inhibition of in vivo Btk activity achieved by administering a given dose of a co-crystal of Compound 1. Cellular assays known in the art can be used to determine in vivo activity of Btk in the presence or absence of an irreversible Btk inhibitor. For example, since activated Btk is phosphorylated at tyrosine 223 (Y223) and tyrosine 551 (Y551), phospho-specific immunocytochemical staining of P-Y223 or P-Y551-positive cells can be used to detect or quantify activation of Btk in a population of cells (e.g., by FACS analysis of stained vs unstained cells). See, e.g., Nisitani et al. (1999), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 96:2221-2226. Thus, the amount of the Btk inhibitor compound that is administered to a subject can be increased or decreased as needed so as to maintain a level of Btk inhibition optimal for treating the subject's disease state.
Compound 1 can irreversibly inhibit Btk and may be used to treat mammals suffering from Bruton's tyrosine kinase-dependent or Bruton's tyrosine kinase mediated conditions or diseases, including, but not limited to, cancer, autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases.

Preparation of Crystalline Forms
In some embodiments, co-crystals of 1-((R)-3-(4-amino-3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl)prop-2-en-1-one are prepared as outlined in the Examples. It is noted that solvents, temperatures and other reaction conditions presented herein may vary.
Suitable Solvents
Therapeutic agents that are administrable to mammals, such as humans, must be prepared by following regulatory guidelines. Such government regulated guidelines are referred to as Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). GMP guidelines outline acceptable contamination levels of active therapeutic agents, such as, for example, the amount of residual solvent in the final product. Preferred solvents are those that are suitable for use in GMP facilities and consistent with industrial safety concerns. Categories of solvents are defined in, for example, the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), “Impurities: Guidelines for Residual Solvents, Q3C(R3), (November 2005).
Solvents are categorized into three classes. Class 1 solvents are toxic and are to be avoided. Class 2 solvents are solvents to be limited in use during the manufacture of the therapeutic agent. Class 3 solvents are solvents with low toxic potential and of lower risk to human health. Data for Class 3 solvents indicate that they are less toxic in acute or short-term studies and negative in genotoxicity studies.
Class 1 solvents, which are to be avoided, include: benzene; carbon tetrachloride; 1,2-dichloroethane; 1,1-dichloroethene; and 1,1,1-trichloroethane.
Examples of Class 2 solvents are: acetonitrile, chlorobenzene, chloroform, cyclohexane, 1,2-dichloroethene, dichloromethane, 1,2-dimethoxyethane, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, 1,4-dioxane, 2-ethoxyethanol, ethyleneglycol, formamide, hexane, methanol, 2-methoxyethanol, methylbutyl ketone, methylcyclohexane, N-methylpyrrolidine, nitromethane, pyridine, sulfolane, tetrahydrofuran, tetralin, toluene, 1,1,2-trichloroethene and xylene.
Class 3 solvents, which possess low toxicity, include: acetic acid, acetone, anisole, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, butyl acetate, tert-butylmethyl ether (MTBE), cumene, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethyl ether, ethyl formate, formic acid, heptane, isobutyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, 2-methyl-1-propanol, pentane, 1-pentanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and propyl acetate.
Residual solvents in active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) originate from the manufacture of API. In some cases, the solvents are not completely removed by practical manufacturing techniques. Appropriate selection of the solvent for the synthesis of APIs may enhance the yield, or determine characteristics such as crystal form, purity, and solubility. Therefore, the solvent is a critical parameter in the synthetic process.
In some embodiments, compositions comprising a co-crystal of Compound 1 comprise an organic solvent(s). In some embodiments, compositions comprising a co-crystal of Compound 1 comprise a residual amount of an organic solvent(s). In some embodiments, compositions comprising a co-crystal of Compound 1 comprise a residual amount of a Class 2 solvent. In some embodiments, compositions comprising a co-crystal of Compound 1 comprise a residual amount of a Class 3 solvent. In some embodiments, the organic solvent is a Class 3 solvent. In some embodiments, the Class 3 solvent is selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, acetone, anisole, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, butyl acetate, tert-butylmethyl ether, cumene, dimethyl sulfoxide, ethanol, ethyl acetate, ethyl ether, ethyl formate, formic acid, heptane, isobutyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, methyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, 2-methyl-1-propanol, pentane, 1-pentanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, propyl acetate, and tetrahydrofuran. In some embodiments, the Class 3 solvent is selected from ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, tert-butylmethylether, heptane, isopropanol, and ethanol.

All documents, or portions of documents, cited in the application including, but not limited to, patents, patent applications, articles, books, manuals, and treatises are hereby expressly incorporated by reference in their entirety for any purpose.
The term “acceptable” or “pharmaceutically acceptable”, with respect to a formulation, composition or ingredient, as used herein, means having no persistent detrimental effect on the general health of the subject being treated or does not abrogate the biological activity or properties of the compound, and is relatively nontoxic.
As used herein, the term “agonist” refers to a compound, the presence of which results in a biological activity of a protein that is the same as the biological activity resulting from the presence of a naturally occurring ligand for the protein, such as, for example, Btk.
As used herein, the term “partial agonist” refers to a compound the presence of which results in a biological activity of a protein that is of the same type as that resulting from the presence of a naturally occurring ligand for the protein, but of a lower magnitude.
As used herein, the term “antagonist” refers to a compound, the presence of which results in a decrease in the magnitude of a biological activity of a protein. In certain embodiments, the presence of an antagonist results in complete inhibition of a biological activity of a protein, such as, for example, Btk. In certain embodiments, an antagonist is an inhibitor.
As used herein, “amelioration” of the symptoms of a particular disease, disorder or condition by administration of a particular compound or pharmaceutical composition refers to any lessening of severity, delay in onset, slowing of progression, or shortening of duration, whether permanent or temporary, lasting or transient that can be attributed to or associated with administration of the compound or composition.
“Bioavailability” refers to the percentage of Compound 1 dosed that is delivered into the general circulation of the animal or human being studied. The total exposure (AUC(0-∞)) of a drug when administered intravenously is usually defined as 100% bioavailable (F %). “Oral bioavailability” refers to the extent to which Compound 1 is absorbed into the general circulation when the pharmaceutical composition is taken orally as compared to intravenous injection.
“Blood plasma concentration” refers to the concentration of Compound 1 in the plasma component of blood of a subject. It is understood that the plasma concentration of Compound 1 may vary significantly between subjects, due to variability with respect to metabolism and/or possible interactions with other therapeutic agents. In accordance with one embodiment disclosed herein, the blood plasma concentration of Compound 1 may vary from subject to subject. Likewise, values such as maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) or time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax), or total area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC(0-∞)) may vary from subject to subject. Due to this variability, the amount necessary to constitute “a therapeutically effective amount” of Compound 1 may vary from subject to subject.
The term “Bruton's tyrosine kinase,” as used herein, refers to Bruton's tyrosine kinase from Homo sapiens, as disclosed in, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,469 (GenBank Accession No. NP_000052).

The terms “co-administration” or the like, as used herein, are meant to encompass administration of the selected therapeutic agents to a single patient, and are intended to include treatment regimens in which the agents are administered by the same or different route of administration or at the same or different time.
The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount,” as used herein, refer to a sufficient amount of an agent or a compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disease or condition being treated. The result can be reduction and/or alleviation of the signs, symptoms, or causes of a disease, or any other desired alteration of a biological system. For example, an “effective amount” for therapeutic uses is the amount of the composition including a compound as disclosed herein required to provide a clinically significant decrease in disease symptoms without undue adverse side effects. An appropriate “effective amount” in any individual case may be determined using techniques, such as a dose escalation study. The term “therapeutically effective amount” includes, for example, a prophylactically effective amount. An “effective amount” of a compound disclosed herein is an amount effective to achieve a desired pharmacologic effect or therapeutic improvement without undue adverse side effects. It is understood that “an effect amount” or “a therapeutically effective amount” can vary from subject to subject, due to variation in metabolism of Compound 1, age, weight, general condition of the subject, the condition being treated, the severity of the condition being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. By way of example only, therapeutically effective amounts may be determined by routine experimentation, including but not limited to a dose escalation clinical trial.
The terms “enhance” or “enhancing” means to increase or prolong either in potency or duration a desired effect. By way of example, “enhancing” the effect of therapeutic agents refers to the ability to increase or prolong, either in potency or duration, the effect of therapeutic agents on during treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. An “enhancing-effective amount,” as used herein, refers to an amount adequate to enhance the effect of a therapeutic agent in the treatment of a disease, disorder or condition. When used in a patient, amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity and course of the disease, disorder or condition, previous therapy, the patient's health status and response to the drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician.
The term “homologous cysteine,” as used herein refers to a cysteine residue found with in a sequence position that is homologous to that of cysteine 481 of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, as defined herein. For example, cysteine 482 is the homologous cysteine of the rat ortholog of Bruton's tyrosine kinase; cysteine 479 is the homologous cysteine of the chicken ortholog; and cysteine 481 is the homologous cysteine in the zebra fish ortholog. In another example, the homologous cysteine of TXK, a Tec kinase family member related to Bruton's tyrosine, is Cys 350. Other examples of kinases having homologous cysteines are shown in FIG. 1. See also the sequence alignments of tyrosine kinases (TK) published on the world wide web at kinase.com/human/kinome/phylogeny.html.
The term “substantially the same,” as used herein to define a figure is intended to mean that the figure is considered the same as a reference figure by a skilled artisan in view of deviations acceptable in the art. Such deviations may be caused by factors related to instruments, operation conditions and human factors, etc., known in the art. For example, one skilled in the art can appreciate that the endotherm onset and peak temperatures as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) may vary significantly from experiment to experiment. In some embodiments, when positions of characteristic peaks of two figures do not vary more than +5% or +1%, it is deemed that the two figures are substantially the same. For example, one skilled in the art can readily identify whether two X-ray diffraction patterns or two DSC thermograms are substantially the same. In some embodiments, when characteristic peaks of two X-ray diffraction patterns do not vary more than ±0.2° 2-Theta or ±0.1° 2-Theta, it is deemed that the X-ray diffraction patterns are substantially the same. The term “characteristic peaks” refers to peaks that are distinguishable from the baseline noise. In some embodiments, “characteristic peaks” refers to peaks having an area, height, or intensity that is at least 30%, at least 25% or at least 20% of the peak having the largest area, height, or intensity, respectively. The term “about” or “˜” when used before a numerical value indicates that the value may vary within a reasonable range, such as within ±10%, ±5% or ±1% of the stated value.
The terms “inhibits”, “inhibiting”, or “inhibitor” of a kinase, as used herein, refer to inhibition of enzymatic phosphotransferase activity.
The term “irreversible inhibitor,” as used herein, refers to a compound that, upon contact with a target protein (e.g., a kinase) causes the formation of a new covalent bond with or within the protein, whereby one or more of the target protein's biological activities (e.g., phosphotransferase activity) is diminished or abolished notwithstanding the subsequent presence or absence of the irreversible inhibitor.
The term “irreversible Btk inhibitor,” as used herein, refers to an inhibitor of Btk that can form a covalent bond with an amino acid residue of Btk. In one embodiment, the irreversible inhibitor of Btk can form a covalent bond with a Cys residue of Btk; in particular embodiments, the irreversible inhibitor can form a covalent bond with a Cys 481 residue (or a homolog thereof) of Btk or a cysteine residue in the homologous corresponding position of another tyrosine kinase.
The term “isolated,” as used herein, refers to separating and removing a component of interest from components not of interest. Isolated substances can be in either a dry or semi-dry state, or in solution, including but not limited to an aqueous solution. The isolated component can be in a homogeneous state or the isolated component can be a part of a pharmaceutical composition that comprises additional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients. By way of example only, nucleic acids or proteins are “isolated” when such nucleic acids or proteins are free of at least some of the cellular components with which it is associated in the natural state, or that the nucleic acid or protein has been concentrated to a level greater than the concentration of its in vivo or in vitro production. Also, by way of example, a gene is isolated when separated from open reading frames which flank the gene and encode a protein other than the gene of interest.
The term “modulate,” as used herein, means to interact with a target either directly or indirectly so as to alter the activity of the target, including, by way of example only, to enhance the activity of the target, to inhibit the activity of the target, to limit the activity of the target, or to extend the activity of the target.
As used herein, the term “modulator” refers to a compound that alters an activity of a molecule. For example, a modulator can cause an increase or decrease in the magnitude of a certain activity of a molecule compared to the magnitude of the activity in the absence of the modulator. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an inhibitor, which decreases the magnitude of one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, an inhibitor completely prevents one or more activities of a molecule. In certain embodiments, a modulator is an activator, which increases the magnitude of at least one activity of a molecule. In certain embodiments the presence of a modulator results in an activity that does not occur in the absence of the modulator.
The term “prophylactically effective amount,” as used herein, refers that amount of a composition applied to a patient which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of a disease, condition or disorder being treated. In such prophylactic applications, such amounts may depend on the patient's state of health, weight, and the like. It is considered well within the skill of the art for one to determine such prophylactically effective amounts by routine experimentation, including, but not limited to, a dose escalation clinical trial.
The term “subject” as used herein, refers to an animal which is the object of treatment, observation or experiment. By way of example only, a subject may be, but is not limited to, a mammal including, but not limited to, a human.
As used herein, the term “target activity” refers to a biological activity capable of being modulated by a selective modulator. Certain exemplary target activities include, but are not limited to, binding affinity, signal transduction, enzymatic activity, tumor growth, inflammation or inflammation-related processes, and amelioration of one or more symptoms associated with a disease or condition.
As used herein, the term “target protein” refers to a molecule or a portion of a protein capable of being bound by a selective binding compound. In certain embodiments, a target protein is Btk.
The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment”, as used herein, include alleviating, abating or ameliorating a disease or condition symptoms, preventing additional symptoms, ameliorating or preventing the underlying metabolic causes of symptoms, inhibiting the disease or condition, e.g., arresting the development of the disease or condition, relieving the disease or condition, causing regression of the disease or condition, relieving a condition caused by the disease or condition, or stopping the symptoms of the disease or condition. The terms “treat,” “treating” or “treatment”, include, but are not limited to, prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments.
As used herein, the IC50 refers to an amount, concentration or dosage of a particular test compound that achieves a 50% inhibition of a maximal response, such as inhibition of Btk, in an assay that measures such response.
As used herein, EC50 refers to a dosage, concentration or amount of a particular test compound that elicits a dose-dependent response at 50% of maximal expression of a particular response that is induced, provoked or potentiated by the particular test compound.

In general, binder levels of 20-70% are used in powder-filled gelatin capsule formulations. Binder usage level in tablet formulations varies whether direct compression, wet granulation, roller compaction, or usage of other excipients such as fillers which itself can act as moderate binder. Formulators skilled in art can determine the binder level for the formulations, but binder usage level of up to 70% in tablet formulations is common.

Compressed tablets are solid dosage forms prepared by compacting the bulk blend of the formulations described above. In various embodiments, compressed tablets which are designed to dissolve in the mouth will include one or more flavoring agents. In other embodiments, the compressed tablets will include a film surrounding the final compressed tablet. In some embodiments, the film coating can provide a delayed release of a co-crystal of Compound 1 from the formulation. In other embodiments, the film coating aids in patient compliance (e.g., Opadry® coatings or sugar coating). Film coatings including Opadry® typically range from about 1% to about 3% of the tablet weight. In other embodiments, the compressed tablets include one or more excipients.
A capsule may be prepared, for example, by placing the bulk blend of the formulation of the co-crystal of Compound 1 inside of a capsule. In some embodiments, the formulations (non-aqueous suspensions and solutions) are placed in a soft gelatin capsule. In other embodiments, the formulations are placed in standard gelatin capsules or non-gelatin capsules such as capsules comprising HPMC. In other embodiments, the formulation is placed in a sprinkle capsule, wherein the capsule may be swallowed whole or the capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food prior to eating. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose is split into multiple (e.g., two, three, or four) capsules. In some embodiments, the entire dose of the formulation is delivered in a capsule form.
In various embodiments, the particles of a co-crystal of Compound 1 and one or more excipients are dry blended and compressed into a mass, such as a tablet, having a hardness sufficient to provide a pharmaceutical composition that substantially disintegrates within less than about 30 minutes, less than about 35 minutes, less than about 40 minutes, less than about 45 minutes, less than about 50 minutes, less than about 55 minutes, or less than about 60 minutes, after oral administration, thereby releasing the formulation into the gastrointestinal fluid.
In another aspect, dosage forms may include microencapsulated formulations. In some embodiments, one or more other compatible materials are present in the microencapsulation material. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, pH modifiers, erosion facilitators, anti-foaming agents, antioxidants, flavoring agents, and carrier materials such as binders, suspending agents, disintegration agents, filling agents, surfactants, solubilizers, stabilizers, lubricants, wetting agents, and diluents.
Materials useful for the microencapsulation described herein include materials compatible with a co-crystal of Compound 1 which sufficiently isolate the co-crystal of Compound 1 from other non-compatible excipients. Materials compatible with a co-crystal of Compound 1 are those that delay the release of the compounds of the co-crystal in vivo.
Exemplary microencapsulation materials useful for delaying the release of the formulations including compounds described herein, include, but are not limited to, hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (HPC) such as Klucel® or Nisso HPC, low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose ethers (L-HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose ethers (HPMC) such as Seppifilm-LC, Pharmacoat®, Metolose SR, Methocel®-E, Opadry YS, PrimaFlo, Benecel MP824, and Benecel MP843, methylcellulose polymers such as Methocel®-A, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate stearate Aqoat (HF-LS, HF-LG, HF-MS) and Metolose®, Ethylcelluloses (EC) and mixtures thereof such as E461, Ethocel®, Aqualon®-EC, Surelease®, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) such as Opadry AMB, hydroxyethylcelluloses such as Natrosol, carboxymethylcelluloses and salts of carboxymethylcelluloses (CMC) such as Aqualon®-CMC, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol co-polymers such as Kollicoat IR®, monoglycerides (Myverol), triglycerides (KLX), polyethylene glycols, modified food starch, acrylic polymers and mixtures of acrylic polymers with cellulose ethers such as Eudragit® EPO, Eudragit® L30D-55, Eudragit® FS 30D Eudragit® L100-55, Eudragit® L100, Eudragit® S100, Eudragit® RD100, Eudragit® E100, Eudragit® L12.5, Eudragit® S12.5, Eudragit® NE30D, and Eudragit® NE 40D, cellulose acetate phthalate, sepifilms such as mixtures of HPMC and stearic acid, cyclodextrins, and mixtures of these materials.

In other embodiments, the microencapsulating material useful for delaying the release of the pharmaceutical compositions is from the USP or the National Formulary (NF). In yet other embodiments, the microencapsulation material is Klucel. In still other embodiments, the microencapsulation material is methocel.
Microencapsulated co-crystals of Compound 1 may be formulated by methods known by one of ordinary skill in the art. Such known methods include, e.g., spray drying processes, spinning disk-solvent processes, hot melt processes, spray chilling methods, fluidized bed, electrostatic deposition, centrifugal extrusion, rotational suspension separation, polymerization at liquid-gas or solid-gas interface, pressure extrusion, or spraying solvent extraction bath. In addition to these, several chemical techniques, e.g., complex coacervation, solvent evaporation, polymer-polymer incompatibility, interfacial polymerization in liquid media, in situ polymerization, in-liquid drying, and desolvation in liquid media could also be used. Furthermore, other methods such as roller compaction, extrusion/spheronization, coacervation, or nanoparticle coating may also be used.
In one embodiment, the particles of a co-crystal of Compound 1 are microencapsulated prior to being formulated into one of the above forms. In still another embodiment, some or most of the particles are coated prior to being further formulated by using standard coating procedures, such as those described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition (2000).
In other embodiments, the solid dosage formulations of a co-crystal of Compound 1 are plasticized (coated) with one or more layers. Illustratively, a plasticizer is generally a high boiling point solid or liquid. Suitable plasticizers can be added from about 0.01% to about 50% by weight (w/w) of the coating composition. Plasticizers include, but are not limited to, diethyl phthalate, citrate esters, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, acetylated glycerides, triacetin, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate, dibutyl sebacate, stearic acid, stearol, stearate, and castor oil.
In other embodiments, a powder including the formulations with a co-crystal of Compound 1 may be formulated to include one or more pharmaceutical excipients and flavors. Such a powder may be prepared, for example, by mixing the formulation and optional pharmaceutical excipients to form a bulk blend composition. Additional embodiments also include a suspending agent and/or a wetting agent. This bulk blend is uniformly subdivided into unit dosage packaging or multi-dosage packaging units.
In still other embodiments, effervescent powders are also prepared in accordance with the present disclosure. Effervescent salts have been used to disperse medicines in water for oral administration. Effervescent salts are granules or coarse powders containing a medicinal agent in a dry mixture, usually composed of sodium bicarbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. When salts of the compositions described herein are added to water, the acids and the base react to liberate carbon dioxide gas, thereby causing “effervescence.” Examples of effervescent salts include, e.g., the following ingredients: sodium bicarbonate or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and sodium carbonate, citric acid and/or tartaric acid. Any acid-base combination that results in the liberation of carbon dioxide can be used in place of the combination of sodium bicarbonate and citric and tartaric acids, as long as the ingredients were suitable for pharmaceutical use and result in a pH of about 6.0 or higher.
In some embodiments, the solid dosage forms described herein can be formulated as enteric coated delayed release oral dosage forms, i.e., as an oral dosage form of a pharmaceutical composition as described herein which utilizes an enteric coating to affect release in the small intestine of the gastrointestinal tract. The enteric coated dosage form may be a compressed or molded or extruded tablet/mold (coated or uncoated) containing granules, powder, pellets, beads or particles of the active ingredient and/or other composition components, which are themselves coated or uncoated. The enteric coated oral dosage form may also be a capsule (coated or uncoated) containing pellets, beads or granules of the solid carrier or the composition, which are themselves coated or uncoated.
The term “delayed release” as used herein refers to the delivery so that the release can be accomplished at some generally predictable location in the intestinal tract more distal to that which would have been accomplished if there had been no delayed release alterations. In some embodiments the method for delay of release is coating. Any coatings should be applied to a sufficient thickness such that the entire coating does not dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids at pH below about 5, but does dissolve at pH about 5 and above. It is expected that any anionic polymer exhibiting a pH-dependent solubility profile can be used as an enteric coating in the methods and compositions described herein to achieve delivery to the lower gastrointestinal tract. In some embodiments the polymers described herein are anionic carboxylic polymers. In other embodiments, the polymers and compatible mixtures thereof, and some of their properties, include, but are not limited to:
Shellac, also called purified lac, a refined product obtained from the resinous secretion of an insect. This coating dissolves in media of pH>7;
Acrylic polymers. The performance of acrylic polymers (primarily their solubility in biological fluids) can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Examples of suitable acrylic polymers include methacrylic acid copolymers and ammonium methacrylate copolymers. The Eudragit series E, L, S, RL, RS and NE (Rohm Pharma) are available as solubilized in organic solvent, aqueous dispersion, or dry powders. The Eudragit series RL, NE, and RS are insoluble in the gastrointestinal tract but are permeable and are used primarily for colonic targeting. The Eudragit series E dissolve in the stomach. The Eudragit series L, L-30D and S are insoluble in stomach and dissolve in the intestine;
Cellulose Derivatives. Examples of suitable cellulose derivatives are: ethyl cellulose; reaction mixtures of partial acetate esters of cellulose with phthalic anhydride. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. Cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) dissolves in pH>6. Aquateric (FMC) is an aqueous based system and is a spray dried CAP psuedolatex with particles<1 μm. Other components in Aquateric can include pluronics, Tweens, and acetylated monoglycerides. Other suitable cellulose derivatives include: cellulose acetate trimellitate (Eastman); methylcellulose (Pharmacoat, Methocel); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose phthalate (HPMCP); hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose succinate (HPMCS); and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (e.g., AQOAT (Shin Etsu)). The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, HPMCP such as, HP-50, HP-55, HP-55S, HP-55F grades are suitable. The performance can vary based on the degree and type of substitution. For example, suitable grades of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate include, but are not limited to, AS-LG (LF), which dissolves at pH 5, AS-MG (MF), which dissolves at pH 5.5, and AS-HG (HF), which dissolves at higher pH. These polymers are offered as granules, or as fine powders for aqueous dispersions; Poly Vinyl Acetate Phthalate (PVAP). PVAP dissolves in pH>5, and it is much less permeable to water vapor and gastric fluids.
In some embodiments, the coating can, and usually does, contain a plasticizer and possibly other coating excipients such as colorants, talc, and/or magnesium stearate, which are well known in the art. Suitable plasticizers include triethyl citrate (Citroflex 2), triacetin (glyceryl triacetate), acetyl triethyl citrate (Citroflec A2), Carbowax 400 (polyethylene glycol 400), diethyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, acetylated monoglycerides, glycerol, fatty acid esters, propylene glycol, and dibutyl phthalate. In particular, anionic carboxylic acrylic polymers usually will contain 10-25% by weight of a plasticizer, especially dibutyl phthalate, polyethylene glycol, triethyl citrate and triacetin. Conventional coating techniques such as spray or pan coating are employed to apply coatings. The coating thickness must be sufficient to ensure that the oral dosage form remains intact until the desired site of topical delivery in the intestinal tract is reached.
Colorants, detackifiers, surfactants, antifoaming agents, lubricants (e.g., carnuba wax or PEG) may be added to the coatings besides plasticizers to solubilize or disperse the coating material, and to improve coating performance and the coated product.
In other embodiments, the formulations described herein, which include co-crystals of Compound 1 are delivered using a pulsatile dosage form. A pulsatile dosage form is capable of providing one or more immediate release pulses at predetermined time points after a controlled lag time or at specific sites. Many other types of controlled release systems known to those of ordinary skill in the art and are suitable for use with the formulations described herein. Examples of such delivery systems include, e.g., polymer-based systems, such as polylactic and polyglycolic acid, plyanhydrides and polycaprolactone; porous matrices, nonpolymer-based systems that are lipids, including sterols, such as cholesterol, cholesterol esters and fatty acids, or neutral fats, such as mono-, di- and triglycerides; hydrogel release systems; silastic systems; peptide-based systems; wax coatings, bioerodible dosage forms, compressed tablets using conventional binders and the like. See, e.g., Liberman et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, 2 Ed., Vol. 1, pp. 209-214 (1990); Singh et al., Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, 2nd Ed., pp. 751-753 (2002); U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,327,725, 4,624,848, 4,968,509, 5,461,140, 5,456,923, 5,516,527, 5,622,721, 5,686,105, 5,700,410, 5,977,175, 6,465,014 and 6,932,983, each of which is specifically incorporated by reference.
In some embodiments, pharmaceutical formulations are provided that include particles of a co-crystal of Compound 1 and at least one dispersing agent or suspending agent for oral administration to a subject. The formulations may be a powder and/or granules for suspension, and upon admixture with water, a substantially uniform suspension is obtained.
It is to be appreciated that there is overlap between the above-listed additives used in the aqueous dispersions or suspensions described herein, since a given additive is often classified differently by different practitioners in the field, or is commonly used for any of several different functions. Thus, the above-listed additives should be taken as merely exemplary, and not limiting, of the types of additives that can be included in formulations described herein. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, according to the particular properties desired.

In the case wherein the patient's status does improve, upon the doctor's discretion the administration of the compounds may be given continuously; alternatively, the dose of drug being administered may be temporarily reduced or temporarily suspended for a certain length of time (i.e., a “drug holiday”). The length of the drug holiday can vary between 2 days and 1 year, including by way of example only, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, 7 days, 10 days, 12 days, 15 days, 20 days, 28 days, 35 days, 50 days, 70 days, 100 days, 120 days, 150 days, 180 days, 200 days, 250 days, 280 days, 300 days, 320 days, 350 days, or 365 days. The dose reduction during a drug holiday may be from 10%-100%, including, by way of example only, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 100%.
Once improvement of the patient's conditions has occurred, a maintenance dose is administered if necessary. Subsequently, the dosage or the frequency of administration, or both, can be reduced, as a function of the symptoms, to a level at which the improved disease, disorder or condition is retained. Patients can, however, require intermittent treatment on a long-term basis upon any recurrence of symptoms.
The amount of a given agent that will correspond to such an amount will vary depending upon factors such as the particular compound, the severity of the disease, the identity (e.g., weight) of the subject or host in need of treatment, but can nevertheless be routinely determined in a manner known in the art according to the particular circumstances surrounding the case, including, e.g., the specific agent being administered, the route of administration, and the subject or host being treated. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day, or from about 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered simultaneously (or over a short period of time) or at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day.
The pharmaceutical composition described herein may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In unit dosage form, the formulation is divided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of one or more compound. The unit dosage may be in the form of a package containing discrete quantities of the formulation. Non-limiting examples are packaged tablets or capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Aqueous suspension compositions can be packaged in single-dose non-reclosable containers. Alternatively, multiple-dose reclosable containers can be used, in which case it is typical to include a preservative in the composition. By way of example only, formulations for parenteral injection may be presented in unit dosage form, which include, but are not limited to ampoules, or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. In some embodiments, each unit dosage form comprises 140 mg of Compound 1. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 1 unit dosage form per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 2 unit dosage forms per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 3 unit dosage forms per day. In some embodiments, an individual is administered 4 unit dosage forms per day.
The foregoing ranges are merely suggestive, as the number of variables in regard to an individual treatment regime is large, and considerable excursions from these recommended values are not uncommon. Such dosages may be altered depending on a number of variables, not limited to the activity of the compound used, the disease or condition to be treated, the mode of administration, the requirements of the individual subject, the severity of the disease or condition being treated, and the judgment of the practitioner.
Toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of such therapeutic regimens can be determined by standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, including, but not limited to, the determination of the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between the toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. Compounds exhibiting high therapeutic indices are preferred. The data obtained from cell culture assays and animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage for use in human. The dosage of such compounds lies preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with minimal toxicity. The dosage may vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized.
Combination Therapy
In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer a co-crystal of Compound 1 in combination with another therapeutic agent.
In one embodiment, the compositions and methods described herein are also used in conjunction with other therapeutic reagents that are selected for their particular usefulness against the condition that is being treated. In general, the compositions described herein and, in embodiments where combinational therapy is employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the same pharmaceutical composition, and are, because of different physical and chemical characteristics, administered by different routes. In one embodiment, the initial administration is made according to established protocols, and then, based upon the observed effects, the dosage, modes of administration and times of administration, further modified.
In various embodiments, the compounds are administered concurrently (e.g., simultaneously, essentially simultaneously or within the same treatment protocol) or sequentially, depending upon the nature of the disease, the condition of the patient, and the actual choice of compounds used. In certain embodiments, the determination of the order of administration, and the number of repetitions of administration of each therapeutic agent during a treatment protocol, is based upon evaluation of the disease being treated and the condition of the patient.
For combination therapies described herein, dosages of the co-administered compounds vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the specific drug employed, on the disease or condition being treated and so forth.
The individual compounds of such combinations are administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical formulations. In one embodiment, the individual compounds will be administered simultaneously in a combined pharmaceutical formulation. Appropriate doses of known therapeutic agents will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.
The combinations referred to herein are conveniently presented for use in the form of a pharmaceutical compositions together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent(s) or carrier(s).

A mixture of Compound 1 (30 mg) and coformer (1.0 mol. eq.) was placed in a 2 mL HPLC vial with two grinding beads. The mixture was initially wetted with 10 μL of CH3CN and ground for 2 h at 650 rpm using a Fritsch milling system with an Automaxion adapter. Samples obtained after this grinding procedure were air dried for 5 min, and analysed by XRPD. The gums and the non-co-crystal solids were re-suspended/dissolved in acetone (750 μL) and then were matured at 50° C./r.t. heat-cool cycles (8 h per cycle) for 72 h. Obtained solids were analysed by XRPD after filtration. Remaining solutions were cooled at 5° C. for 72 h. If no co-crystal was obtained, then the solutions were allowed to evaporate at r.t. and the resulting solids were analysed by XRPD. Using this procedure, 2-ethoxybenzamide/Compound 1 co-crystal was obtained (with residual 2-ethoxybenzamide and freebase Compound 1).
Example 2i2: Preparation of Compound 1 Co-Crystals-Procedure 10b
Compound 1 (100 mg) was dissolved/suspended in either isopropyl acetate, CH3CN, EtOH, MEK, or THF (20 vol., 2 mL) at 50° C. with stirring. After 10 min, the solutions and suspension were treated with 2-ethoxybenzamide (1.0 mol eq., added as solid) at 50° C. The mixtures were cooled to 5° C. at 1° C./min. All the samples were seeded with ˜1 mg of the 2-ethoxybenzamide/Compound 1 cocrystal at about 25° C. After 16 h at 5° C., the samples were naturally brought to r.t., and any resulting solids were filtered, air dried and analysed by XRPD. Remaining solutions and mother liquors were allowed to evaporate at r.t. and the resulting solids were analysed by XRPD. Using this procedure, the co-crystal of Compound 1 with 2-ethoxybenzamide was obtained.
Example 2j: Preparation of Compound 1 Co-Crystals-Procedure 11
A mixture of Compound 1 (30 mg) and a potential coformer (1.0 mol eq.) was placed in a 2 mL HPLC vial with two grinding beads. The mixture was initially wetted with 10 μL of CH3CN and ground for 2 h at 650 rpm using a Fritsch milling system with an Automaxion adapter. Samples obtained after this grinding procedure were air dried for 5 min, and analysed by XRPD. Using this procedure, co-crystals of 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid/Compound 1, 4-amino salicylic acid/Compound 1, fumaric acid/Compound 1, salicylamide/Compound 1, trans-cinnamic acid/Compound 1 (Form 2), and stearic acid/Compound 1 were obtained.
A second treatment was applied on the non-co-crystal solids by suspending/dissolving them in acetone (500 μL) at r.t. The suspensions were filtered and analysed by XRPD. The remaining solutions and resulting mother liquors were allowed to evaporate at r.t. and the resulting solids were analysed by XRPD. 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid/Compound 1 co-crystal was obtained from the evaporation.
Example 2k: Preparation of Compound 1 Co-Crystals-Procedure 12
A mixture of Compound 1 (30 mg) and coformer (1.0 mol eq.) was dissolved in methanol (500 μL) at r.t. The solutions were cooled at 5° C. for 24 h. If no solid was obtained, the solutions were allowed to evaporate at r.t. All the solids were filtered, air dried and analysed by XRPD. 4-hydroxybenzoic acid/Compound 1 co-crystal was obtained from the evaporation.
Example 3: Scale-Up Preparation of Benzoic Acid and Compound 1 Co-Crystal
A mixture of crystalline Compound 1 (500 mg) and benzoic acid (1 mol eq) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) at 50° C. The mixture was cooled to 5° C. at 1° C./min. The mixture was then seeded at ˜40° C. with ˜5 mg of the benzoic acid/Compound 1 co-crystal. After 16 h at 5° C., the mixture was warmed to room temperature. The solid was collected by filtration, air dried and analysed by XRPD to give the title compound.
Example 4: Scale-Up Preparation of Succinic Acid and Compound 1 Co-Crystal
A mixture of crystalline Compound 1 (500 mg) and succinic acid (1 mol eq) was dissolved in ethanol (10 mL) at 50° C. The mixture was cooled to 5° C. at 1° C./min. The mixture was then seeded at ˜40° C. with ˜5 mg of the succinic acid/Compound 1 co-crystal. After 16 h at 5° C., the mixture was warmed to room temperature. The solid was collected by filtration, air dried and analysed by XRPD to give the title compound.
Example 5: Scale-Up Preparation of Salicylic Acid and Compound 1 Co-Crystal
A mixture of crystalline Compound 1 (500 mg) and salicylic acid (1 mol eq) was dissolved in acetone (10 mL) at 50° C. The mixture was cooled to 5° C. at 1° C./min. The mixture was then seeded at ˜40° C. with ˜5 mg of the salicylic acid/Compound 1 co-crystal. After 16 h at 5° C., the mixture was warmed to room temperature. The solid was collected by filtration, air dried and analysed by XRPD to give the title compound.
Example 6: Kinetic Solubility of Scaled-Up Compound 1 Co-Crystals
Aqueous solubility was determined by suspending sufficient compound in water to give a maximum final concentration of ≧10 mg/mL of the parent free-form of the compound. The suspension was equilibrated at 25° C. for 2 hours with aliquots sampled at 30, 60 and 120 min; the pH was measured at each time point. The suspension was then filtered through a glass fibre C filter. The filtrate was then diluted by an appropriate factor. Quantitation was by HPLC with reference to a standard solution of approximately 0.2 mg/mL in CH3CN:water. Different volumes of the standard, diluted and undiluted sample solutions were injected. The solubility was calculated using the peak areas determined by integration of the peak found at the same retention time as the principal peak in the standard injection. Data were collected at three time points as detailed below:
<table>

Example 7: X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRPD)
X-Ray powder diffraction patterns were collected on a Bruker AXS C2 GADDS or Bruker AXS D8 diffractometer.
Bruker AXS C2 GADDS
X-Ray Powder Diffraction patterns were collected on a Bruker AXS C2 GADDS diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), automated XYZ stage, laser video microscope for auto-sample positioning and a Hi Star 2-dimensional area detector. X-ray optics consists of a single Göbel multilayer mirror coupled with a pinhole collimator of 0.3 mm. A weekly performance check is carried out using a certified standard NIST 1976 Corundum (flat plate). The beam divergence, i.e., the effective size of the X-ray beam on the sample, was approximately 4 mm. A θ-θ continuous scan mode was employed with a sample-detector distance of 20 cm which gives an effective 2θ range of 3.2°-29.7°. Typically the sample would be exposed to the X-ray beam for 120 seconds. The software used for data collection was GADDS for XP/2000 4.1.43 and the data were analysed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA v15.0.0.0.
Ambient Conditions
Samples run under ambient conditions were prepared as flat plate specimens using powder as received without grinding. Approximately 1-2 mg of the sample was lightly pressed on a glass slide to obtain a flat surface.
Non-Ambient Conditions
Samples run under non-ambient conditions were mounted on a silicon wafer with heatconducting compound. The sample was then heated to the appropriate temperature at 20° C./min (unless otherwise stated) and subsequently held isothermally for 1 minute before data collection was initiated.
Bruker AXS D8 Advance
X-Ray Powder Diffraction patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), θ-2θ goniometer, and divergence of V4 and receiving slits, a Ge monochromator and a Lynxeye detector. The instrument is performance checked using a certified Corundum standard (NIST 1976). The software used for data collection was Diffrac Plus XRD Commander v2.6.1 and the data were analysed and presented using Diffrac Plus EVA v15.0.0.0. Samples were run under ambient conditions as flat plate specimens using powder as received. The sample was gently packed into a cavity cut into polished, zero-background (510) silicon wafer. The sample was rotated in its own plane during analysis. The details of the data collection are:Angular range: 2 to 42° 2θStep size: 0.05° 2θCollection time: 0.5 s/step

Example 9: Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermo-Gravimetric Analysis (TGA)
DSC data were collected on a TA Instruments Q2000 equipped with a 50 position autosampler. The calibration for thermal capacity was carried out using sapphire and the calibration for energy and temperature was carried out using certified indium. Typically 0.5-3 mg of each sample, in a pin-holed aluminium pan, was heated at 10° C./min from 25° C. to 300° C. A purge of dry nitrogen at 50 mL/min was maintained over the sample, unless otherwise stated. Modulated temperature DSC was carried out using an underlying heating rate of 2° C./min and temperature modulation parameters of +0.318° C. (amplitude) every 60 seconds (period). The instrument control software was Advantage for Q Series v2.8.0.394 and Thermal Advantage v5.5.3 and the data were analysed using Universal Analysis v4.5A.
TGA data were collected on a TA Instruments Q500 TGA, equipped with a 16 position autosampler. The instrument was temperature calibrated using certified Alumel and Nickel. Typically 5-10 mg of each sample was loaded onto a pre-tared aluminium DSC pan and heated at 10° C./min from ambient temperature to 350° C.
