FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to chemical compounds and their pharmaceutical uses. More particularly, the invention relates to selective inhibitors of cysteine proteases (CPs) including caspases and their uses for the prevention and/or treatment of various diseases and conditions in subjects.
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
In humans, CPs are responsible for apoptosis, MHC Class II immune responses, prohormone processing and intracellular and extracellular matrix remodeling. As examples of CPs, there are: Actinidain, Bromelain, Calpains, Caspases, Cathepsins, Mir1-CPs, and Papain. CPs have also been recognized as critical enzymes in degenerative and autoimmune states (Zbigniew et al. 2007, Industrial Enzymes, book, 181-195). As an example, tumor cell invasion and metastasis are associated with the proteolytic activities of various types of proteases. Elevated expression of certain Cathepsins and diminished levels of their inhibitors have been reported to be involved in several human cancers, including brain, breast, gastric, glioma, prostate, lung, head and neck cancer and melanoma (Berdowska, Clinica Chimica Acta 342 (2004) 41-69). Beside cancers, Cathepsins have been reported to be involved in inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory myopathies, rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis.
Cysteine proteases of the papain family have been reported to play an important role in microbial (viral, bacterial) and parasitic infectious (Tong et al, 2002, Chem. Rev. 102, 4609-4626 and Han et al, 2005, Biochemistry 44, 10349-10359).
Caspases comprise a family of cysteine protease enzymes with a well-known role as key mediators in apoptosis signaling pathways and cell disassembly. Interleukin converting enzyme (ICE), also known as Caspase-1, was the first identified caspase and has a proinflammatory role. There is growing evidence demonstrating the role of caspases in very diverse pathologies. For instance it is known that proapoptotic caspases are involved in the pathogenesis of many cardiovascular disorders. Some proapoptotic caspases such as caspase-8 also possess non-apoptotic function that may contribute to tumor progression. Caspase-1 plays an important role in the response to pathogenic infection as well as in inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. In addition, caspase-1 activity is increased in retinas of diabetic patients and it constitutes a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte programmed cell death in the mammalian heart. Caspases also play a role in neurodegenerative diseases and trauma. For instance, it has been shown that the caspase-3 cascade is highly activated in traumatic spinal cord injury. Finally, the activation of caspase-1 and caspase-3 in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and the activation of caspase-7, -8, and -9 in a mouse model at end stage of ALS have been reported. Increased levels of apoptosis and caspase activity (especially caspase-3) are reported to be frequently observed at sites of cellular damage in both acute (e.g. sepsis, myocardial infarction(MI), ischemic Stroke, spinal cord injury (SCI), traumatic brain injury (TBI)) and neurodegenerative disease (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases, and multiple sclerosis (MS)). Caspase-6 is implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer and Huntington's diseases. In Alzheimer's caspase-6 has been shown to cut amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau leading to a toxic fragment. In Huntington's disease, caspase-6 may be responsible for the type of Huntington fragments that lead to nerve cell death and symptoms.
Since caspases are involved in a number of diseases, several compounds and methods have been developed to inactivate them. For example, the broad irreversible caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk) was protective and efficiently blocked death receptor-mediated liver injury in animal models (Rodriguez et al. (1996), J Exp Med. 1996 Nov 1; 184(5):2067-72). Myocardial infarction and the resulting death of myocytes was ameliorated by z-VAD-fmk and related peptide inhibitors in animal models (Yaoita et al., 91998) Circulation 97: 276-281). There has been a lot of effort into identifying inhibitors of peptidase. For instance, Hanzlik and Thompson (J. Med. Chem. (1984), 27(6), 711-712) describe vinylogous amino acid esters for inactivating thiol proteases. Thompson et al. (J. Med. Chem. (1986), 29(1), 104-111) describe carboxyl-modified amino acids and peptides as protease inhibitors. Liu and Hanzlik have prepared a series of peptidyl Michael acceptors with different electron withdrawing groups with different recognition and binding groups as inactivators against papain, a member of the cysteine proteinase family.
However, most of these prior art compounds are reversible inhibitors with diminished efficacy over time and safety problems. The diminished efficacy over time and safety problems are due to these compounds being reversible inhibitors of cysteine proteases that also have a "pro-" form of the cysteine protease; for example, a reversible caspase inhibitor causes more of the pro-caspase in the cell to turn into caspase (due to chemical equilibrium and similar effects) with the end effect being that when the reversible inhibitors release their caspase and leave the cell (or are metabolized), the cell ends up with more caspase than it had to begin with - thus the net effect of the reversible casapse inhibitors over time is the opposite of the desired effect of lowering the caspase levels, causing potentially significant side-effects and safety problems. In addition, some of these inhibitors sometimes bind irreversibly, but when they do, they release a toxic leaving group. Thus, the end result often seen with these types of inhibitors is that, even though they help to ameliorate the disease in the early stages of administration, they ultimately lose most of these effects over time with potentially serious negative side-effects.
The compounds of this invention are directed to a unique new group of compounds with irreversible cysteine protease inhibitory activity, some of which have no leaving groups. Compounds of formula I, II, and IA possess in their structure a Michael acceptor (vinyl groups conjugated to electron withdrawing groups) which confers an irreversible inhibition against cysteine proteases. The molecules can range from 1 to 5 natural or non-natural amino acids and the electrophilic "war head" moieties (e.g, vinyl sulfone, vinyl ester) are attached most notably to aspartic acid although other natural or non-natural amino acids are also possible (see Z, n description).
Wannamaker et al. (WO 01/90063) discloses an ICE inhibitor prodrug for treating IL-1 mediated diseases. However, the prodrug lacks the electrophilic moieties of the compounds of the present invention.
Palmer et al. (US patent No. 5,976,858 and 6,287,840) described irreversible cysteine protease inhibitors containing vinyl groups conjugated to electron withdrawing groups. Palmer has shown compounds capable to inhibit cathepsins (B, I, S); cruzain and glutathione. However, Palmer showed that his compounds had no activity against cysteine proteases when aspartic acid is used at P1 position (e.g, Asp vinyl sulfone) except in one single case where the activity was below the threshold value for being considered to have any significance by the authors (and was thus discarded for any further development by the authors). This is the opposite of what is observed with the compounds of the present invention.
Similarly, Ng et al. (Org. Biomol. Chem, 2008, 6, 844-847) developed a library of compounds including some vinylsulfone inhibitors to target caspase-3 and -7. However none of the vinylsulfone inhibitors showed potency against caspase-3 and only one molecule showed modest inhibitory activity against caspase-7 according to the authors.
Maria M. M. Santos et al. (European Journal of Med Chem: 46 (2011) 2141 and 45 (2010) 3858) have developed some non-selective aspartic acid vinyl sulfone derivatives with marginal potency. Due to the marginal potency in enzymatic assays, the authors believed that the potency observed was due to an indirect effect on caspase-3 inhibition.
Similarly, Nazif T et al. (EP 1863513, US 7,589,066, PNAS: 2001, 98 (6), 2967-2972) described global analysis of proteasomal substrate specificity using positional-scanning libraries of covalent inhibitors. Nazif has shown compounds capable to inhibit selectively immunoproteasomes as compared to a constitutive proteasome (10-fold or greater). However, in addition to being selective immunoproteasome inhibitors, Nazif's compounds are apoptosis inducers. The compounds of the present invention are not selective immunoproteasome inhibitors and apoptosis inducers, and in many cases the compounds of the present invention are apoptosis inhibitors.
Given their role in several diseases and conditions, there is a need for compounds capable of selectively targeting either a specific caspase or a group of caspases or a cysteine protease. There is also a need for effective pharmaceutical compositions and methods of treatment for caspase-mediated diseases and cysteine protease-mediated diseases.
The present invention addresses these needs for novel compounds, therapies, new treatment methods, and pharmaceutical compositions.
Additional features of the invention will be apparent from review of the disclosure, tables and description of the invention below.

As used herein, the term "electron withdrawing group (EWG)" is intended to mean a functional group that allows nucleophilic attack by the thiol-group of a caspase at the alkene bond of the inhibitor as a result of the electron withdrawing properties of the EWG. The EWG is conjugated with the alkene bond, such that the electron withdrawing properties of the EWG allow nucleophilic attack by a caspase at the alkene bond, i.e. the alkene bond and the EWG are electronically conjugated. Thus, the covalent bond between the alkene bond and the EWG is a direct one, without intervening moieties that would prevent the electron withdrawing properties of the EWG from being exerted on the alkene bond.
As used herein, the term "detectable label" is intended to mean a group that may be linked to a compound of the present invention to produce a probe or to a caspase, such that when the probe is associated with the caspase, the label allows either direct or indirect recognition of the probe so that it may be detected, measured and quantified.
As used herein, the term "affinity tag" is intended to mean a ligand or group, which is linked to either a compound of the present invention or to a caspase to allow another compound to be extracted from a solution to which the ligand or group is attached.
As used herein, the term "probe" is intended to mean a compound of Formula I, IA, II, IIA, III, or IIIA, which is labeled with either a detectable label or an affinity tag, and which is capable of binding, either covalently or non-covalently, to a caspase. When, for example, the probe is non-covalently bound, it may be displaced by a test compound. When, for example, the probe is bound covalently, it may be used to form cross-linked adducts, which may be quantified and inhibited by a test compound.
As used herein, the term "optionally substituted with one or more substituents" or its equivalent term "optionally substituted with at least one substituent" is intended to mean that the subsequently described event of circumstances may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances in which it does not. The definition is intended to mean from zero to five substituents.
If the substituents themselves are incompatible with the synthetic methods of the present invention, the substituent may be protected with a suitable protecting group (PG) that is stable to the reaction conditions used in these methods. The protecting group may be removed at a suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method to provide a desired intermediate or target compound. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and de-protecting different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art; examples of which may be found in T. Greene and P. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Chemical Synthesis (3rd ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (1999). Examples of protecting groups used throughout include, Fmoc, Bn, Boc, CBz and COCF3. In some instances, a substituent may be specifically selected to be reactive under the reaction conditions used in the methods of this invention. Under these circumstances, the reaction conditions convert the selected substituent into another substituent that is either useful in an intermediate compound in the methods of this invention or is a desired substituent in a target compound.

As used herein, the term "prodrug" is intended to mean a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound of the present invention. Thus, the term "prodrug" refers to a precursor of a compound of the invention that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive or display limited activity when administered to a subject in need thereof, but is converted in vivo to an active compound of the present invention. Typically, prodrugs are transformed in vivo to yield the compound of the invention, for example, by hydrolysis in blood or other organs by enzymatic processing. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in the subject (see, Bundgard, H., Design of Prodrugs (1985), pp. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). The definition of prodrug includes any covalently bonded carriers which release the active compound of the invention in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a subject. Prodrugs of a compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound of the invention in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to a parent compound of the invention.
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean both acid and base addition salts.
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt" is intended to mean those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, and which are formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and organic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid.
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt" is intended to mean those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from inorganic bases include, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, ethanolamine, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, methylglucamine, theobromine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins.
The compounds of the present invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers, chiral axes and chiral planes and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms and may be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry, such as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is intended to include all such possible isomers, as well as, their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC. The racemic mixtures may be prepared and thereafter separated into individual optical isomers or these optical isomers may be prepared by chiral synthesis. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may then be separated by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography, selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer specific reagent. It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by a separation technique, an additional step is then required to form the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively specific enantiomers may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts, or solvents or by converting one enantiomer to another by asymmetric transformation.
Certain compounds of the present invention may exist as a mix of epimers. Epimers means diastereoisomers that have the opposite configuration at only one of two or more stereogenic centers present in the respective compound.
Certain compounds of the present invention may exist in Zwitterionic form and the present invention includes Zwitterionic forms of these compounds and mixtures thereof.
In addition, the compounds of the invention also may exist in hydrated and anhydrous forms. Hydrates of the compound of any of the formulas described herein are included as compounds of the invention. In a further embodiment, the compound according to any of the formulas described herein is a monohydrate.

D) Development of specific Caspase inhibitors
An additional aspect of the invention relates to a method for designing caspase inhibitors. Following the same approach as outlined hereinafter, those skilled in the art will appreciate that it is conceivable to further improve the potency of the compounds of Formula I, e.g. 2-Quinoline carbonyl-t-Leu-pro-Asp methyl vinyl sulfone (Compound 6) inhibits selectively caspase-1 over othert caspases such as caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-3.
As is known, all caspases cleave substrates to the right of the aspartic acid amino acid in position P1. However, caspase-3 requires an additional Asp at position P4, which confers caspase-3 its specificity. As shown in Table 2, Z-Asp-Phg-Val-Asp Ethyl Vinyl Ester (compound 105) proved to be very potent against caspase-3 (27 nM), and potent against Caspase-1 (1050 nM), Caspase-7 (145 nM), caspase8 (2624 nM), caspase-9 (994 nM) and caspase-10 (592 nM). The class of Ethyl Vinyl ester peptide showed very strong potency against caspases as well.
As shown in Table 3 hereinafter, monopeptide suicide substrates such as Asp achlorovinyl methyl vinyl sulfone, Tosyl salt (Compound 4) showed inhibition against caspase-10 (43 %) at 100 uM.The di-peptide suicide substrates Z-Val-Asp achlorovinyl methyl vinyl sulfone (Compound 2) showed inhibition against caspase-7 (60 %), caspase-3 (39 %), caspase-9 (66%), caspase-8 (49 %) and caspase-10 (48 %) at 100 uM.
As shown in Table-2 Compounds 123 (Z-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp- achlorovinyl methyl vinyl sulfone) and 124 (Z-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp Ethyl Vinyl ester) exhibited inhibition against Caspase-6 (229 nM) and (293 nM) respectively. Compound 126 (Z-Val-Glu-Phg-Asp-Ethyl Vinyl ester) exhibited selective inhibition against both caspase initiators Caspase-8 (79 nM) and Caspase-10 (2 nM). Compound 124 (Z-Val-Glu-Ile-Asp Ethyl Vinyl ester) is a pan-caspase inhibitor.
Z-Asp-t-Leu-Pro-Asp-methyl vinyl sulfone (compound 26), proved to be a very potent inhibitor of caspase-3 with an IC50 123 nM, caspase-7 (378 nM), caspase-9 (662 nM), caspase-10 (161 nM. Replacement of t-Leu at position P3 by Phg (compound 30) affected the potency against caspase-3 (3410 nM) and more seriously the activity of the other caspases. Replacement of t-Leu at position P3 (compound 26) by Cyclopropylglycine (compound 28) affected the potency against caspase-3 by 7 fold and more seriously the activity of the other caspases. Replacement of Pro at position P2 by 2-Azetidine (compound 32) did not affect the potency against caspase-3, but affected seriously the activity of the other caspases.
Changes in position P4
Changes in position P4 can also affect the selectivity of a given inhibitor. The amino acid that has been showed to fit well into the corresponding caspase-1 pockets at position P4 is Tryptophan. Therefore, Z-Trp-Glu-Val-Asp-methyl vinyl sulfone (compound 40) was tested against different caspases, and it proved to be selective against caspase-1 (26 nM). The amino acid that has been showed to fit well into the corresponding caspase-1 pockets at position P3 is glutamic acid.
The P4 of compound 26 could be replaced by a cap to generate tri-peptide EWG (electron withdrawing group).The replacement of aspartic acid in P4 position of compound 26 by quinaldic acid lead to 2-Quinoline carbonyl-t-Leu-pro-Asp methyl vinyl sulfone (compound 6) which proven to be very potent against caspase-1 (42 nM) and potent against caspase-4 (1549 nM), caspase-5 (2320 nM). The replacement of aspartic acid in P4 position by 2-Quinoline carbonyl-t-Leu-pro-Asp methyl vinyl sulfone lead to (4-amino-3-chlorobenzene carbonyl)-t-Leu-Pro-Asp methyl vinyl sulfone (compound 14) which proven to be very potent against caspase-1 (19 nM) and potent against caspase-4 (87 nM), caspase-5 (563 nM), caspase-9 (2311 nM), caspase-10 (2671 nM) and caspase-8 (12.8 uM). The replacement of aspartic acid vinyl sulfone in P1 position of compound 6 by Asp Ethyl Vinyl ester proven to be very potent against caspase-1 as well (31 nM) and showed better potency against caspase-4 (588 nM), caspase-9 and caspase-10.These specific examples demonstrate that it is possible to make shorter peptide EWG to target selectively caspase-1 or two groups of caspases. Following the same approach as outlined hereinafter, it is conceivable to inhibit selectively additional caspases and to further improve the potency against selected caspases.

Preferably, the compound(s) of the invention can be orally administered. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle (e.g. an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier) and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. The amount of the therapeutic agent in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained.
Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules (e.g. hard or soft shell gelatin capsule), cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges, powders, granules, pellets, dragees, e.g., coated (e.g., enteric coated) or uncoated, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles or as mouth washes, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. Moreover, in certain embodiments these pellets can be formulated to (a) provide for instant or rapid drug release (i.e., have no coating on them); (b) be coated, e.g., to provide for sustained drug release over time; or (c) be coated with an enteric coating for better gastrointestinal tolerability. Coating may be achieved by conventional methods, typically with pH or time-dependent coatings, such that the compound(s) of the invention is released in the vicinity of the desired location, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, waxes, and shellac.

Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above.
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use may include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient (i.e., the therapeutic agent) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
Pharmaceutical formulations are also provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol, by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of the desired compound of any Formula herein or a plurality of solid particles of such compound(s). The desired formulation may be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization may be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the agents or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. The size of the solid particles or droplets will be, for example, from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. A pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol may be in the form of a liquid, the formulation will comprise a water-soluble agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in a carrier which comprises water. A surfactant may be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization.
The compositions of this invention can also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct laying on or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or epithelial tissue of the subject, or transdermally via a "patch". Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels and solids. These topical compositions may comprise an effective amount, usually at least about 0.1%, or even from about 1% to about 5%, of a compound of the invention. Suitable carriers for topical administration typically remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the therapeutic agent. The carrier may include pharmaceutically acceptable emollients, emulsifiers, thickening agents and solvents.
Other compositions useful for attaining systemic delivery of the subject agents include sublingual, buccal and nasal dosage forms. Such compositions typically comprise one or more of soluble filler substances such as sucrose, sorbitol and mannitol; and binders such as acacia, microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose. Glidants, lubricants, sweeteners, colorants, antioxidants and flavoring agents disclosed above may also be included.
The compound(s) of the invention may also be administered parenterally, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intraspinally, intrathecally or intracerebrally. For such compositions, the compound(s) of the invention can be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations may contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
In addition to the traditional drug delivery systems (oral, subcutaneous, intravenous (IV), intraperitoneal (IP)) intranasal drug delivery may constitutes a suitable alternative to deliver the compound(s) of the invention directly to CNS (critical reviews in therapeutic Drug Carrier Systems 23(4): 319-347, 2006).
Intranasal drug delivery allows certain drugs to be delivered in low doses, avoiding hepatic first pass metabolism with minimal side effects, improving cost effectiveness and better patient compliance. Intranasal delivery allows the drug that do not cross the BBB to be delivered to the central nervous system within minutes. It also directly delivers drugs that do cross the BBB to the brain. This is due to the unique connection that the olfactory and trigeminal nerves provide between the brain and external environment (Recent Patents on drug Delivery & Formulation 2008, 2, 25-40).
Formulation of the invention suitable for intranasal administration may involve gelling agent or gel-forming carriers such as hydroxypropylcellulose, methylcellulose, poly(vinyl pyrrlidone); poly(ethylene oxide); crosslinked poly(acrylic acid), and chitosan.

The Z-Asp(β-tert-Butyl)-Phg-Val-OH (120 mg, 0.216 mmol) is dissolved in a mix of THF and DMF (1.47 ml / 0.3 ml). The mixture was allowed to reach -18 °C (Ice/MeOH bath) before dropwise addition of N-methyl morpholine (24.5 µl) followed 3 min later with dropwise addition of isobutyl chloroformate (29 µl). The mixture was stirred for 10 minutes (the ice bath was changed after 8 minutes when the temperature of the bath dropped -13 °C). Next, Asp (β-tert-butyl) Ethyl Vinyl Ester tosyl salt (92 mg, 1 eq) was added in one shot, followed by dropwise addition of N-methyl morpholine (24.5 µl). The mixture was stirred for 35 minutes, then diluted with 6 ml of dichloromethane and quenched with dropwise addition of water (2 ml) at -12 °C. The mixture was stirred 2 minutes at -12 °C and 5 minutes at RT. The mixture was transfered in a separatory funnel and it was diluted with dichloromethane (18 ml). The aquous layer was washed with dichloromethane (2 * 15 ml). The combined organic layer was dried over magnesium sulphate. The solvent was evaporated to dryness. The obtained residue was solubilized in a minimum of dichloromethane at 44 °C, then added to the samplet of Biotage column (25 g). The purification is carried out first with ethyl acetate / hexane (40%, 12 CV), then dichloromethane / methanol (0 to 15 %, 10 CV) to afford 100 mg of Z-Asp(β-tert-Butyl)-Phg-Val-Asp(β-tert-Butyl) Ethyl Vinyl Ester.

Example 20: Caspase-1 to Caspase-10 Inhibitor Screening Assay
Methods:
The efficacy of an array of compounds as an inhibitor of the activity of Caspases 1 through 10 were assessed by using the respective Caspase Inhibitor Drug Screening Kits (Caspase-1 Catalog #: K151-100, Caspase-2 Catalog #: K152-100, Caspase-3 Catalog #: K153-100, Caspase-4 Catalog #: K154-100, Caspase-5 Catalog #: K155-100, Caspase-6 Catalog #: K156-100, Caspase-7 Catalog #: K157-100, Caspase-8 Catalog #: K158-100, Caspase-9 Catalog #: K159-100, Caspase-10 Catalog #: K160-100, BioVision) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The preferred synthetic peptide substrates for the different caspases were utilized for each assay (Caspase-1 substrate: YVAD-AFC, Caspase-2 substrate: VDVAD-AFC, Caspase-3 substrate: DEVD-AFC, Caspase-4 substrate: LEVD-AFC, Caspase-5 substrate: WEHD-AFC, Caspase-6 substrate: VEID-AFC, Caspase-7 substrate: DEVD-AFC, Caspase-8 substrate: IETD-AFC, Caspase-9 substrate: LEHD-AFC, Caspase-10 substrate: AEVD-AFC). Active caspases cleaved their respective synthetic substrates to release free AFC, which was then quantified by fluorometry.
Briefly, the compounds were first tested at 2 concentrations (10uM and 100uM final) to determine if there is a hit. This was done by mixing the compounds with the respective active caspases, after which the corresponding synthetic substrate was added for a final reaction volume of 20ul. Each condition was tested in duplicates. After a 30-minute incubation period at 37°C, the liberation of AFC was measured as an endpoint assay using the FIexstation3™ (Molecular Devices) with an excitation wavelength of 400nm and an emission wavelength of 505nm. The level of inhibition of the activity of the various caspases was determined by comparing the relative fluorescence intensity in samples with or without the compounds using the equation below (*). Subsequently based on the results, an 11 -point titration was performed for a group of compounds for a selection of the caspases with final concentrations of 1, 3.3, 10, 33, 100, 333, 1000, 3333, 10000, 33333, 100000nM. For some samples, a smaller range of concentrations was tested depending on the %Inhibition results at 10uM and 100uM. Results were summarized in Tables 2, 2 and 3 herein after. Table 2 represents the IC50 values (uM) of the test compounds as inhibitors of the activity of the various caspases. Table 3 shows the %Inhibition of the respective caspase activity for the test compounds at 100uM, which allows us to distinguish the differences in between samples where no IC50 value was determined. Similarly, Table 4 shows the %Inhibition of the respective caspase activity for the test compounds at 10uM.
