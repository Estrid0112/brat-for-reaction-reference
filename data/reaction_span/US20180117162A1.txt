PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT
This invention was made under a joint research agreement between International Business Machines Corporation and the Agency For Science, Technology and Research.
BACKGROUND
Hydrogels and organogels produced from the self-assembly of synthetic polymers have an inexhaustible potential to serve as a delivery matrix for a vast range of pharmaceutical, cosmetic and dietary products. Recent developments in polymer chemistry have enabled polymers to be synthesized with well-controlled composition and architecture. Highly versatile orthogonal functionalization strategies also allow gelation of such polymers and containment of drug payload through one or a combination of the following association mechanisms: hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, physical entanglement of macromolecules and chemical crosslinking of the matrix.
A number of physical gel systems have been formulated using the ‘ABA’-type triblock copolymers, and the polymeric amphiphiles can be designed with either the ‘A’ or ‘B’ constituent blocks to be hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Many of such systems engage the use of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as the uncharged hydrophilic constituent block for its biocompatibility and non-toxicity. As for hydrophobic portion(s), some of commonly selected blocks are poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), poly(glycolide) (PGA), and poly(caprolactone) (PCL), which can be prepared either as the middle ‘B’ block (e.g., PEG-b-PGA-b-PEG) or as the terminus ‘A’ blocks (e.g., PLLA-b-PEG-b-PLLA). Aqueous mixture of enantiomeric triblock copolymers of the PLLA and PDLA-containing polymers could also give rise to physical gels formed via stereocomplexation.
Polymeric gel systems can be broadly classified as organogels or hydrogels, depending on the dispersion media used. Organogels have an organic liquid phase that is immobilized by a 3D physically crosslinked network of intertwined fibers of self-assembled polymer chains. Various kinds of organic material can be used to make up the liquid phase (e.g., organic solvents, mineral oil, plant oil, and combinations of the foregoing). Organogels are mainly used for cosmetics/dietary applications while relatively much fewer organogels are being evaluated as drug/vaccine delivery matrices. This is primarily due to the scarce amount of information available regarding the toxicology and biocompatibility of the gel-forming polymers and their degraded products. Nevertheless, when toxicity concerns are circumvented, organogels have potential for use as topical formulations owing to the enhanced dermal permeation capacities of typical organogels. Alternative modes of application include oral and trans-mucosal as well as subcutaneous depot injections. Herein, a depot is a body area in which a substance (e.g., a drug) can be accumulated, deposited, or stored and from which it can be distributed. A depot injection is an injection of a substance in a form that tends to keep it at or near the site of injection so that absorption occurs over a prolonged period.
Hydrogels, which are prepared in water, are more widely-studied compared to organogel systems. Most of the commonly used hydrogel-forming ‘ABA’-type triblock copolymers (e.g., PLLA-b-PEG-b-PLLA and PCL-b-PEG-b-PCL) require high polymer concentration and hydrophobic content for hydrogel formation. For instance, (PLLA-b-PEG-b-PLLA) containing lactide content of 17 wt. % to 37 wt. % requires a minimum concentration of about 16 wt. % of the triblock copolymer for gelation. Such a high proportion of hydrophobic constituents could give rise to adverse physiological effects during in vivo degradation. Thus, it is desirable to develop polymeric materials that can form hydrogels at a low concentration.
According to a 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) survey, breast cancer comprises of 22.9% of all cancers (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and its mortality rate is around 13.7% worldwide. In Europe, the incident rate of breast cancer is even higher, reaching 28%. Treatment of breast cancer may vary according to the size, stage and rate of growth, as well as the type of tumor. There are currently three main categories of adjuvant, or post-surgery, therapy. These include hormone-blocking therapy, chemotherapy and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) therapy. The latter involves the utilization of mAbs to target specific cells or proteins towards the treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing, or suppressing an immune response. It can be used in conjunction with either hormone-blocking therapy or chemotherapy to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment.
Studies have shown that the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) genes are amplified and/or overexpressed in 20% to 25% of invasive breast cancers. These HER2-positive breast cancers have significantly lower survival rates compared to HER2-negative breast tumors. The HER2-positive breast tumors are most likely to show unrestrained growth and division of cells, thus increasing the incidence of cancer development. Herceptin is a recombinant humanized mAb that can selectively bind to HER2 proteins, thereby regulating the otherwise uncontrollable cancer cell growth. It is also a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. Intravenous administration is the current mode of herceptin delivery in most clinics. However, many controversies surround the optimal mode of delivery in terms of duration and dosage. Recently, F Hoffmann-La Roche reported a phase 3 clinical trial (HannaH study) involving the subcutaneous (versus intravenous) administration of (neo)adjuvant herceptin in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The formulation contained a fixed dose of herceptin and recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH-20), a class of enzymes that temporarily degrades interstitial hyaluronan in the subcutaneous space, as an excipient. The study found that therapeutic efficacy of subcutaneous delivery of herceptin was comparable to the traditional intravenous route but the therapy had the advantage of improved patient convenience, better compliance, reduced pharmacy preparation times, and optimization of medical resources.
The foregoing illustrates that an ongoing need exists for more efficacious drug and antibiotic formulations. More specifically, formulations are needed for improved efficacy of subcutaneous treatments used in cancer therapy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed are medical compositions comprising a mixture of a hydrogel-forming (“gel-forming”) block copolymer and a therapeutic agent (e.g., drug), which are in non-covalent association. The block copolymer is a linear polymer having a ABA type block structure (two peripheral blocks A and a central block B). The end units of the central hydrophilic block B are covalently linked to respective end units of the peripheral hydrophobic blocks A by way of respective independent divalent linking groups designated L' and L″. At least one of L' and L″ contains an *-N(H)-* group capable of donating a hydrogen and/or an electron pair to form a hydrogen bond. The gel-forming block copolymers have utility in medical compositions used in depot injections for controlled drug release. The hydrogen-bonding *-N(H)-* group(s) extends the in vivo gel lifetime before enzymatic degradation and provides a longer, more controlled rate of drug release compared to an otherwise identical block copolymer lacking the hydrogen-bonding *-N(H)-* group(s). The hydrophilic block B is a divalent poly(ethylene oxide) chain having a degree of polymerization (DP) of about 100 to about 600. Each of the hydrophobic blocks A can be a monocarbonate or a polycarbonate comprising 1 to about 10 carbonate subunits. The carbonate subunits comprise a covalently bound form of a vitamin and are also referred to herein as vitamin-bearing subunits. The vitamin-bearing subunits comprise a carbonate backbone portion and a sidechain portion linked to the backbone portion. The sidechain portion bears a covalently bound form of a vitamin. The end groups of the block copolymer are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1-C15 groups.
The hydrophobic blocks can comprise an optional second carbonate subunit, which can act as a diluent for the vitamin-bearing subunits and/or provide additional functionality (e.g., charge-containing amine or carboxylic acid groups) for enhancing the payload-carrying capacity and/or bioactive properties of the gel-forming block copolymers. In a preferred embodiment, the gel-forming block copolymers are non-charged. In another embodiment, each of the hydrophobic blocks consists essentially of 1 to about 4 vitamin-bearing subunits, and each of the end groups is hydrogen.
The gel-forming block copolymer and the therapeutic agent (e.g., antimicrobial cationic polymer, described further below) can be biodegradable. The term “biodegradable” is defined by the American Society for Testing and Materials as degradation caused by biological activity, especially by enzymatic action, leading to a significant change in the chemical structure of the material. For purposes herein, a material is “biodegradable” if it undergoes 60% biodegradation within 180 days in accordance with ASTM D6400. Herein, a material is “enzymatically biodegradable” if the material can be degraded (e.g., depolymerized) by a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme.
The gel-forming block copolymer and therapeutic agent can be biocompatible. A “biocompatible” material is defined herein as a material capable of performing with an appropriate host response in a specific application.
The gel-forming block copolymer can form a gel in a solvent at a temperature of about 20° C. to about 40° C., at a gel-forming block copolymer concentration of about 4 wt. % or more, preferably about 4 wt. % to about 10 wt. %, based on total weight of the gel including solvent. Stiffness of the physical gels, represented by the storage modulus (G'), can vary from about 300 Pascals (Pa) to about 12,000 Pa by adjusting the gel-forming block copolymer structure and/or the concentration. The solvent can be water, an organic solvent, or a mixture thereof. Organic solvents include volatile organic liquids (e.g., ethanol) and organic liquids having little or no volatility (e.g., mineral oils, plant oils) at standard temperatures and pressures.
Herein, “gels” means “hydrogels and/or organogels” unless otherwise indicated. The gels are formed by noncovalent interactions of polymer chains of the gel-forming block copolymer in a given solvent. The gel network is composed of physical crosslinks of these polymer chains. The gels can serve as a matrix for delivering a variety of medically useful materials, including one or more drugs, which can be physically loaded into the gels.
Herein, a “drug” can be any substance recognized or defined by the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that can be effectively formulated with the disclosed gels and provide an effective therapeutic use. Drugs include substances used in the diagnosis, treatment, and/or prevention of a disease, and/or treatment of wounds. Drugs also include materials used in topically applied cosmetics products and cosmetic surgery products. Drugs also include dietary products such as vitamins. Drugs also include living cells if used for a therapeutic treatment. The drugs are preferably contained in the gel without being covalently bound to the gel-forming block copolymer. The drugs can be dissolved or dispersed in the gel matrix.
A drug can be a naturally produced or synthetic compound, a naturally produced or synthetic polymer, or combinations of the foregoing materials. Non-limiting exemplary naturally produced compounds include paclitaxel, artemisinin, alkaloids, terpenoids, phytosterols, natural phenols, ciclosporin, lovastatin, morphine, quinine, tubocurarine, nicotine, muscarine, asperlicin, eleutherobin, discodermolide, bryostatins, dolostatins, cephalostatins, and vitamins. Exemplary synthetic compounds include the antimicrobial drugs cephalosporins, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, rifamycins, chloramphenicol, fluconazole and doxycycline. Exemplary naturally produced polymers include genes, nucleotides, proteins, and peptides. Exemplary synthetic polymers include antimicrobial cationic polycarbonates and monoclonal antibodies produced artificially by a genetic engineering technique.
Herein, a vitamin is defined as any of a group of organic compounds that are essential in small quantities for normal metabolism of a living body, and generally cannot be synthesized in the body. Exemplary vitamins include vitamin A (retinol), vitamin B1 (thiamine), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid), vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B7 (biotin), vitamin B9 (folic acid), vitamin B12 (cobalamines), beta-carotene, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), vitamin D compounds (which include vitamin D1 (calciferol), vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), and/or vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)), vitamin E compounds (which include alpha-tocopherol, beta-tocopherol, gamma-tocopherol, delta-tocopherol, alpha-tocotrienol, beta-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, and/or delta-tocotrienol), and vitamin K1 (phylloquinone).
Herein, a loaded gel is a medical composition comprising a solvent, about 2 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a gel-forming block copolymer, and about 0.0001 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a drug, more specifically about 0.0001 wt. % to about 2 wt. % of the drug, and even more specifically about 0.0001 wt. % to about 1 wt. % of the drug. For example, a loaded gel can comprise an anti-tumor drug suitable for treating a cancer. As another example, a loaded gel can comprise an antimicrobial cationic polymer (a first drug). The antimicrobial cationic polymer can be a homopolymer, random copolymer, block copolymer, star polymer, star polymer having a crosslinked microgel core, dendritic polymer, or a combination of the foregoing polymer types. Preferably, the antimicrobial cationic polymer is one or more of the cationic polymers described further below, which are cationic polycarbonates. The antimicrobial cationic polycarbonate is preferably contained in the gel without being covalently bound to the gel-forming block copolymer. The loaded gel can further comprise an antimicrobial compound (a second drug) such as, for example, fluconazole, which is suitable for eradicating biofilms. The loaded gels can include one or more drugs, which are associated by noncovalent interactions in the gel. The loaded gels provide a means for controlling the release rate of a drug and localizing the drug in the vicinity of the application site or injection site, thereby increasing the efficacy of the drug.
The loaded gel compositions can be delivered by various types of injection, including intradermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, intraosseous, and/or intraperitoneal injection. The loaded gels can be applied topically to a skin surface (e.g., for transdermal delivery of biologically active substances), and/or to other body surfaces, including the eyes and body cavities. The loaded gels can also be applied to wounds.
The solvent for the loaded gel can be water and/or an organic solvent. A non-limiting example of an organic solvent is KOLLIPHOR RH40 (registered trademark of BASF). KOLLIPHOR RH40, also known as PEG-40 castor oil, is a non-ionic polyethoxylated detergent.

The contiguously linked atomic centers should be understood to be between the polycarbonate backbone and Q'. For example, if La-Q' is:
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00058.TIF </img>
then the shortest path from the polymer backbone to Q' has 5 contiguously linked atomic centers, as numbered. The shortest path does not include the carbonyl oxygen. As another example, if La-Q' is
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00059.TIF </img>
then the shortest path from the polymer backbone to Q' has 6 contiguously linked atomic centers, as numbered. The shortest path does not include the amide hydrogen and the carbonyl oxygen. As another example, if La-Q' is
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00060.TIF </img>
then the shortest path from the polymer backbone to Q' has 8 contiguously linked atomic centers, as numbered. The shortest path does not include two carbons of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl oxygen. As another example, if La-Q' is
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00061.TIF </img>
then the shortest path from the polymer backbone to Q' has 7 contiguously linked atomic centers, as numbered. The shortest path does not include three carbons of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl oxygen. Finally, as another example, if La-Q' is
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00062.TIF </img>
then the shortest path from the polymer backbone to Q' has 4 contiguously linked atomic centers, as numbered. The shortest path does not include the aromatic ring and the carbonyl oxygen.
Preferably, Q' of the first carbonate subunits is spaced from the polymer backbone by the shortest path having 6 to about 15 contiguously linked atomic centers, and more preferably 8 to about 15 contiguously linked atomic centers.

Ring Opening Polymerizations
The reaction mixture used to prepare the disclosed gel-forming block copolymers by ring opening polymerization (ROP) comprises a vitamin-bearing cyclic carbonate monomer and a dinucleophilic poly(ethylene oxide) ROP initiator comprising at least one nitrogen. The reaction mixture can optionally comprise a solvent, ROP catalyst, and/or ROP accelerator. Preferably, the ROP is performed by bulk polymerization of a reaction mixture consisting essentially of the cyclic monomer and poly(ethylene oxide) initiator at 100-130° C. under vacuum. “Consisting essentially of” means the reaction mixture contains no catalyst, solvent, and accelerator.
The ROP used to prepare the antimicrobial cationic polymers preferably comprises a solvent, an organocatalyst, a nucleophilic ROP initiator, and one or more cyclic carbonate monomers. A ROP accelerator is optional.
Using a vitamin-bearing monomer of formula (6) to illustrate a method of forming a gel-forming block copolymer of formula (1) by ring opening polymerization, a reaction mixture is formed that comprises a vitamin-bearing monomer of formula (6) and a di-nucleophilic poly(ethylene oxide) initiator comprising one or more *-N(H)-* groups, which can be present as a primary amine, secondary amine, tertiary amine, amide, carbamate, and/or urea group. Heating the reaction mixture under vacuum for about 24 hours at a temperature of about 80° C. to about 150° C. produces a living gel-forming block copolymer of formula (1) having terminal subunits comprising a nucleophilic group capable of initiating a ROP. Optionally, the initial gel-forming block copolymer is end capped with a suitable end capping agent.
Using a cation-forming monomer of formula (29) to illustrate a method of making the disclosed cationic polymers, a reaction mixture is formed which comprises a cyclic carbonate monomer of formula (29), a catalyst, an optional accelerator, a mono-nucleophilic ROP initiator (optionally comprising a steroid group), and a solvent. Agitating the reaction mixture at 20-40° C. forms an initial polymer. Optionally the initial polymer can be endcapped to form an endcapped initial polymer. The resulting polymer has a structure according to formula (35):

wherein
n' represents the number of cationic carbonate subunits, wherein n' has a value of about 5 to about 45,
Z' is a monovalent C1-C15 first end group,
Z″ is a monovalent second end group selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and C1-C15 moieties,
La is a divalent linking group comprising at least 3 carbons,
E' is a substituent capable of reacting to produce a cationic moiety Q'(Ra)u' linked to La, wherein Q' is a tetravalent positive-charged nitrogen or phosphorus, u' has a value of 1 to 3, each Ra is an independent radical having a valency of 1 to 3, wherein each Ra comprises 1 or more carbons, and together Q'(Ra)u' and La comprise 6 to about 25 carbons,

The living end (oxy end) of the initial polymer formed by the ROP has a reactive hydroxy group (second end group Z″═H), which is capable of initiating another ROP. The living end can be treated with an endcap agent, thereby forming a second end group Z″ that is capable of preventing further chain growth and stabilizing the polymer against unwanted side reactions such as chain scission. The polymerization and endcapping can occur in the same pot without isolating the initial polymer. Endcap agents include, for example, materials for converting terminal hydroxy groups to esters, such as carboxylic acid anhydrides, carboxylic acid chlorides, and reactive esters (e.g., p-nitrophenyl esters). In an embodiment, the endcap agent is an acylating agent, and the second end group Z″ is an acyl group. In another embodiment the acylating agent is acetic anhydride, and the second end group Z″ is an acetyl group. In another embodiment, the endcap agent comprises a covalently bound form of a steroid group, a vitamin, or a combination thereof.
The initial polymer and/or the endcapped initial polymer can be treated chemically, thermally, and/or photochemically to convert E' to a positive-charged Q'(Ra)u' group, thereby forming a cationic polymer. For example, E' can be an electrophilic leaving group (e.g., chloride, bromide, iodide, sulfonate ester, and the like), which is capable of undergoing a nucleophilic displacement reaction with a Lewis base (e.g., tertiary amine, trialkyl phosphine) to form a quaternary ammonium group and/or a phosphonium group. In an embodiment, E' is chloride, bromide, and/or iodide. In another embodiment, the cyclic carbonate monomer is a compound of formula (31) and the initial polymer comprises a subunit of formula (32). In another embodiment, the cyclic carbonate monomer is a compound of formula (33) and the initial polymer comprises a subunit of formula (34).
Also contemplated is a method of forming the cationic polymer using a cationic cyclic carbonate monomer that comprises a positive-charged Q' group. In this instance, the ROP forms an initial cationic polymer having a living end unit (i.e., a nucleophilic hydroxy end group capable of initiating a subsequent ROP).

In an embodiment, the accelerator has two or three nitrogens, each capable of participating as a Lewis base, as for example in the structure (−)-sparteine. Stronger bases generally improve the polymerization rate.
The catalyst and the accelerator can be the same material. For example, some ring opening polymerizations can be conducted using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) alone, with no another catalyst or accelerator present.
When used, the catalyst is preferably present in an amount of about 0.2 to 20 mol %, 0.5 to 10 mol %, 1 to 5 mol %, or 1 to 2.5 mol %, based on total moles of cyclic carbonyl monomer.
The nitrogen base accelerator, when used, is preferably present in an amount of 0.1 to 5.0 mol %, 0.1 to 2.5 mol %, 0.1 to 1.0 mol %, or 0.2 to 0.5 mol %, based on total moles of cyclic carbonyl monomer. As stated above, in some instances the catalyst and the nitrogen base accelerator can be the same compound, depending on the particular cyclic carbonyl monomer.
The initiator groups are preferably present in an amount of 0.001 to 10.0 mol %, 0.1 to 2.5 mol %, 0.1 to 1.0 mol %, or 0.2 to 0.5 mol %, based on total moles of cyclic carbonyl monomer.
In a specific embodiment, the catalyst is present in an amount of about 0.2 to 20 mol %, the nitrogen base accelerator is present in an amount of 0.1 to 5.0 mol %, and the nucleophilic initiator groups of the initiator are present in an amount of 0.1 to 5.0 mol % based on total moles of cyclic carbonate monomer.
The catalysts can be removed by selective precipitation or in the case of the solid supported catalysts, simply by filtration. The catalyst can be present in an amount of 0 wt % (weight percent) to about 20 wt %, preferably 0 wt % (weight percent) to about 0.5 wt % based on the total weight of the cationic oligomer and the residual catalyst. The cationic oligomer preferably comprises no residual catalyst.
The ring-opening polymerization can be performed at a temperature that is about ambient temperature or higher, more specifically 15° C. to 200° C., and even more specifically 20° C. to 80° C. Reaction times vary with solvent, temperature, agitation rate, pressure, and equipment, but in general the polymerizations are complete within 1 to 100 hours.
When a solvent is present, the ROP polymerization is conducted under an inert (i.e., dry) atmosphere, such as nitrogen or argon, and at a pressure of 100 MPa to 500 MPa (1 atm to 5 atm), more typically at a pressure of 100 MPa to 200 MPa (1 atm to 2 atm). At the completion of the reaction, the solvent can be removed using reduced pressure. When the ROP is performed by bulk polymerization at elevated temperature, the ROP is conducted using reduced pressure.
Average Molecular Weight.
The gel-forming block copolymers can have a number average molecular weight (Mn) as determined by size exclusion chromatography of about 5500 to about 55000.
The cationic polymers have a number average molecular weight (Mn) as determined by size exclusion chromatography of about 1500 to about 50,000, more specifically about 1500 to about 30,000. The precursor polymer to the cationic polymer and/or the cationic polymer preferably can have a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.01 to about 2.0, more particularly 1.01 to 1.30, and even more particularly 1.01 to 1.25.
In some instances the cationic polymers alone can self-assemble into nanoparticulate micelles in de-ionized water. The cationic polymers can have a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of about 15 mg/L to about 45 mg/L. The micelles can have a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for microbial growth of about 7 mg/L to about 500 mg/L. In some instances, the MIC is below the CMC, meaning the antimicrobial activity is not dependent on self-assembly of the cationic polymers.
In general, cationic polymers having a DP of 5 to about 45 in which greater than 75% of the side chain La-Q'(Ra)u' groups of the cationic carbonate subunits contained 8 carbons or less were weakly active against Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive microbes and fungi. Moreover, at low DP (<10) the HC50 and/or HC20 values of the cationic polymers generally fell below 500 mg/L, indicating a trend toward biocidal properties. Higher HC50 and/or HC20 values (500 mg/L or higher) were generally favored by a DP of about 10 to about 45. The examples further below also show that when at least 25% of the side chain groups of the cationic carbonate subunits contained 13 or more carbons and the DP was about 10 to about 30, the cationic polymers were highly active (MIC<500 mg/L) against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive microbes and fungi, and had HC50 values of 500 mg/L or higher. Increased inhibition efficacy and lower red blood cell toxicity (higher HC50 values) were obtained using a steroid end group Z'. Hemolytic selectivity (HC50/MIC) also rose. The groups Z', Z″, Zc, and C' can be used to further adjust antimicrobial activity, hemolytic selectivity, or to provide a secondary function (e.g., cell recognition capability, enhancement of cell membrane permeability, and so on).
Moreover, 10 mol % or less of carbonate subunits comprising an alpha-tocopheryl (a vitamin E compound) and/or an ergocalciferyl (vitamin D2) side chain moiety was also effective in lowering MIC (i.e., increasing toxicity to microbes) and/or increasing HC50 values (lowering toxicity to mammalian red blood cells) when 25% to 100% of the cationic carbonate subunits comprised 10 to 25 carbons.
Utility
A medical composition comprises a solvent, about 4 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a disclosed gel-forming block copolymer, and about 0.0001 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a drug, wherein weight percent (wt. %) is based on total weight of the medical composition. The medical composition has the form of a gel wherein the block copolymer, drug and solvent are bound by noncovalent interactions. The drug can be a non-polymeric drug or a polymeric drug (e.g., antimicrobial cationic polymer). The polymeric drug can be present in the gel matrix in the form of non-associated polymer chains, self-assembled particles (e.g., micelles), and/or other complexes formed by noncovalent interactions.

Also disclosed is an antimicrobial composition for killing a microbe. The composition comprises water, about 4 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of a disclosed gel-forming block copolymer, and about 0.0001 wt. % to about 10 wt. % of an antimicrobial drug, wherein weight percent (wt. %) is based on total weight of the antimicrobial composition. In an embodiment, the antimicrobial drug is an antimicrobial cationic polycarbonate (first drug).

The examples below show that these combinations also can exhibit synergistic enhancement in toxicity to microbes compared to the same composition lacking either the antimicrobial cationic polymer or the antimicrobial compound when tested under otherwise identical conditions. The antimicrobial aqueous solution can be suitable for eradicating a microbial biofilm.
Further disclosed is a method of killing a microbe, comprising contacting a microbe with any of the foregoing antimicrobial compositions.
Exemplary microbes include Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Candida albicans (C. albicans), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii), Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae).
Additionally disclosed is a method of treating a cancer, comprising performing a in vivo depot injection of a gel composition near or in contact with a tumor, thereby inhibiting growth of the tumor. The gel composition comprises a solvent, a disclosed gel-forming block copolymer, and an anti-tumor agent. In an embodiment, the anti-tumor agent is a monoclonal antibody. In another embodiment, the anti-tumor agent is herceptin.
For the examples below, the following definitions are applicable.
HC50 is defined as the concentration (in mg/L) of cationic polymer that causes 50% of mammalian red blood cells to undergo hemolysis. HC50 values of 500 mg/L or higher are desirable.
HC20 is defined as the concentration (in mg/L) of cationic polymer that causes 20% of mammalian red blood cells to undergo hemolysis. HC20 values of 500 mg/L or higher are desirable.
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is defined as the minimum concentration (in mg/L) of cationic polymer required to inhibit growth of a given microbe for a twenty-four period. An MIC less than 500 mg/L is desirable. Even more desirable is a MIC of 250 mg/L or less. A lower MIC indicates higher antimicrobial activity.
Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is defined as the minimum concentration (in mg/L) of cationic polymer required to kill a given microbe. A lower MBC indicates higher antimicrobial activity.
HC50 selectivity is defined as the ratio of HC50/MIC. An HC50 selectivity of 4 or more is desirable. Higher HC50 selectivity values indicate more activity against microbial cells and less toxicity to mammalian cells. Likewise, HC20 selectivity is defined as the ratio of HC20/MIC. An HC20 selectivity of 4 or more is desirable.
The examples further below demonstrate that the gel-forming triblock copolymers have a large payload-carrying capacity and improved release properties when the linking groups of the gel-forming block copolymer comprise nitrogens capable of donating hydrogen and/or an electron pair to form hydrogen bonds, enabling numerous pharmaceutical-driven applications.

Herein, Mn is the number average molecular weight, Mw is the weight average molecular weight, and MW is the molecular weight of one molecule.
A p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true. The lower the p-value, the less likely the result is if the null hypothesis is true, and consequently the more “significant” the result is, in the sense of statistical significance. The null hypothesis is oftentimes rejected when the p-value is less than the significance level a (Greek alpha), which is often 0.05 or 0.01. P-values are reported below simply as “P”.
Apoptosis refers to the death of cells which occurs as a normal and controlled part of an organism's growth or development process. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include blebbing, loss of cell membrane asymmetry and attachment, cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation.
Unless indicated otherwise, materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI or Merck. All solvents were of analytical grade, purchased from Fisher Scientific or J. T. Baker and used as received. Before transferring into the glove box, monomers and other reagents (e.g., initiator, monomer, etc.) were dried extensively by freeze-drying under high vacuum.
N-bis(3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl-N'-cyclohexylthiourea (TU) was prepared as reported by R. C. Pratt, et al., Macromolecules, 2006, 39 (23), 7863-7871, and dried by stirring in dry THF over CaH2, filtering, and removing solvent under vacuum.
1,8-Diazabicyclo[5,4,0]undec-7-ene (DBU) was stirred over CaH2 and vacuum distilled before being transferred to a glove box.
Human dermal fibroblasts were cultured in RPMI1640 medium. All culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 micrograms/mL streptomycin (HyClone, U.S.A.). MTT was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) with a concentration of 5 mg/mL, and the solution was filtered with a 0.22 micrometer filter to remove blue formazan crystals prior to use.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of monomers and polymers were recorded using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer, and operated at 400 and 100 MHz respectively, with the solvent proton signal as the internal reference standard.
Molecular Weight Determination by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
SEC was conducted using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent for monitoring the polymer conversion and also for the determination of polystyrene equivalent molecular weights of the macro-transfer agents. THF-SEC was recorded on a Waters 2695D (Waters Corporation, U.S.A.) Separation Module equipped with an Optilab rEX differential refractometer (Wyatt Technology Corporation, U.S.A.) and Waters HR-4E as well as HR 1 columns (Waters Corporation, U.S.A.). The system was equilibrated at 30° C. in THF, which served as the polymer solvent and eluent with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Polymer solutions were prepared at a known concentration (ca. 3 mg/mL) and an injection volume of 100 microliters was used. Data collection and analysis were performed using the Astra software (Wyatt Technology Corporation, U.S.A.; version 5.3.4.14). The columns were calibrated with series of polystyrene standards ranging from Mp=360 Da to Mp=778 kDa (Polymer Standard Service, U.S.A.).
Rheological Experiments
Hydrogels and organogels of known concentrations (4 to 8 wt. %) were prepared by dissolving the copolymers in deionized (DI) water at 25° C. The rheological analysis of the hydrogels was performed on an ARES-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments, USA) equipped with a plate-plate geometry of 8 mm diameter. Measurements were taken by equilibrating the gels at 25° C. between the plates at a gap of 1.0 mm. The data were collected under controlled strain of 0.2% and a frequency scan of 1.0 to 100 radians/second. Gelation properties of the polymer suspension was monitored by measuring the shear storage modulus (G') and the loss modulus (G″) at each point. For shear-thinning studies, the viscosity of the hydrogels was monitored as function of shear rate from 0.1 to 10 sec−1.
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Imaging of Hydrogel
To minimize morphological perturbations, the hydrogels were cryo-fixed by transferring the sample into a chamber filled with liquid nitrogen. A day of freeze-drying process was then followed. The morphology of the gel was observed using SEM (Jeol JSM-7400F, Japan).

A 100 mL round bottom flask was charged with bis-MPA, (7), (5.00 g, 37 mmol, MW 134.1), bis-(pentafluorophenyl) carbonate (PFC, 31.00 g, 78 mmol, MW 394.1), and CsF (2.5 g, 16.4 mmol) rinsed with 70 mLs of tetrahydrofuran (THF). Initially the reaction was heterogeneous, but after one hour a clear homogeneous solution was formed that was allowed to stir for 20 hours. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the residue was re-dissolved in methylene chloride. The solution was allowed to stand for approximately 10 minutes, at which time the pentafluorophenol byproduct precipitated and could be quantitatively recovered. This pentafluorophenol byproduct showed the characteristic 3 peaks in the 19F NMR of pentafluorophenol and a single peak in the GCMS with a mass of 184. The filtrate was extracted with sodium bicarbonate, water and was dried with MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo and the product was recrystallized (ethyl acetate/hexane mixture) to give MTC-C6F5 as a white crystalline powder. The GCMS had a single peak with mass of 326 g/mol. The calculated molecular weight for C12H7F5O5 was consistent with the assigned structure. 1H-NMR (400 MHz in CDCl3): delta 4.85 (d, J=10.8 Hz, 2H, CHaHb), 4.85 (d, J=10.8 Hz, 2H, CHaHb), 1.55 (s, 3H, CCH3).

A flask was charged with MTC-C6F5 (10 g, 30.6 mmol), p-chloromethyl benzyl alcohol (4.8 g, 30.6 mmol), PROTON SPONGE (2 g, 9.3 mmol) and THF (30 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred for 12 hours then added directly to a silica gel column. The product was isolated using diethyl ether as the eluent to yield 7.45 g (81%) white crystalline powder.

<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00126.TIF </img>
MTCOH (8.82 g, 55 mmol) was converted to MTCOCl using standard procedures with oxalyl chloride. In a dry 250 mL round bottom flask equipped with a stir bar, the formed intermediate was dissolved in 150 mL of dry methylene chloride. Under nitrogen flow an addition funnel was attached in which 3-chloropropanol (4.94 g, 4.36 mL, 52.25 mmol), pyridine (3.95 g, 4.04 mL, 55 mmol), and 50 mL of dry methylene chloride was charged. The flask was cooled to 0° C. using an ice bath and the top solution was added drop wise during a period of 30 minutes. The formed solution was stirred for an additional 30 minutes before the ice bath was removed and the solution was stirred for an additional 16 hours under nitrogen. The crude product MTC-PrCl was directly applied onto a silica gel column and the product was separated by eluting with 100% methylene chloride. The product fractions were removed and the solvent was evaporated, yielding the product as off-white oil, which crystallized upon standing. Yield 11 g (85%). 1H-NMR (CDCl3) delta: 4.63 (d, 2H, CH2), 4.32 (t, 2H, CH2), 4.16 (d, 2H, CH2), 3.55 (t, 2H, CH2), 2.09 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.25 (s, 3H, CH3).

MTCOPrBr was prepared by the procedure for MTCOPrCl on a 45 mmol scale using 3-bromo-1-propanol as the alcohol. The product was purified by column chromatography, and subsequently recrystallized to yield white crystals (6.3 g, 49%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): delta 4.69 (d, 2H; CH2OCOO), 4.37 (t, 2H; OCH2), 4.21 (d, 2H; CH2OCOO), 3.45 (t, 2H; CH2Br), 2.23 (m, 2H; CH2), 1.33 (s, 3H; CH3). 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3): delta 171.0, 147.3, 72.9, 63.9, 40.2, 31.0, 28.9, 17.3.
Preparation of MTC-VitE Monomer
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00128.TIF </img>
MTC-OH (3.08 g, 19.3 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (50 mL) with a few drops of DMF. Oxalyl chloride (3.3 mL, 39.4 mmol) was then added dropwise and the reaction mixture stirred under a flow of nitrogen for 1 hour before volatiles were removed under vacuum. The resultant off-white solid was heated to 65° C. for 2-3 minutes to remove any residual reagent and solvent to give the acyl chloride intermediate, MTC-C1. The solid was redissolved in dry dichloromethane (50 mL) and chilled to 0° C. using an ice bath. A solution of alpha-tocopherol (8.30 g, 19.3 mmol) and dry triethylamine (3 mL, 21.6 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (50 mL) was subsequently added dropwise over 30 min. The mixture was allowed to warm up to ambient temperature and stirred for an additional 18 hours. A crude solid was obtained after removal of solvent, and was subjected to purification by column chromatography using silica gel. Hexane was initially used as the eluent before gently increasing the polarity to finally end with 50% ethyl acetate. A second chromatography separation was carried out using dichloromethane/ethyl acetate (4:1) in order to obtain the desired product in high purity as a white solid (6.05 g, 53%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): delta 4.92 (d, 2H, J=10.8 Hz, MTC-CH2), 4.34 (d, 2H, J=10.8 Hz, MTC-CH2), 2.59 (d, 2H, J=6.7 Hz, tetrahydropyrano-CH2), 2.09 (s, 3H, Ar-CH3), 2.00 (s, 3H, Ar-CH3), 1.96 (s, 3H, ArCH3), 1.70-1.90 (m, 2H), 1.00-1.60 (overlapping peaks, 27H), 0.80-0.90 (m, 12H, 4×CH3 on hydrophobic tail).

<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00129.TIF </img>
MTC-VitD2 was prepared according to the general procedure used to prepare MTC-VitE above. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 6.20 (d, 1H, VitD-C═CH-), 6.01 (d, 1H, VitD-C═CH-), 5.21 (t, 2H, VitD-CH═CH-), 5.08 (s, 2H, VitD-C═CH2), 4.86 (s, 1H, -OCH- of VitD), 4.66 (d, 2H, MTC CH2-), 4.17 (d, 2H, MTC-CH2-), 1.15 2.90 (m, 24H, H of VitD and MTC-CH3), 1.02 (d, 3H, VitD-CH3), 0.91 (d, 3H, VitD-CH3), 0.84 (t, 6H, VitD-CH3), 0.55 (s, 3H, Vit-CH3).
Preparation of Cationic Polymers
Examples 1 to 8
Random cationic copolymers were prepared using MTC-PrBr and MTC-BnCl precursors for the cationic subunits, MTC-VitE as the hydrophobic comonomer, benzyl alcohol (BnOH) initiator, and DBU/thiourea as catalysts. Quarternization was performed with trimethylamine. The reaction sequence is shown in Scheme 1.

The preparation of cationic polymer VE/BnCl (1:30) (i.e., m':n' is 1:30) is representative. In a 20 mL vial containing a magnetic stir bar in the glove box, MTC-BnCl (608.8 mg, 2.04 mmol, 30 equiv.), MTC-VitE (40.0 mg, 68 micromoles, 1.0 equiv.) and TU (25.2 mg, 68 micromoles, 1.0 equiv.) were dissolved in dichloromethane (3 mL). To this solution, benzyl alcohol (BnOH) (7.0 microliters, 68 micromoles, 1.0 equiv.) followed by DBU (10.2 microliters, 68 micromoles, 1.0 equiv.) were added to initiate polymerization. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes and quenched by the addition of excess (˜20 mg) of benzoic acid. The mixture was then precipitated into ice-cold methanol (50 mL) and centrifuged at −5° C. for 30 minutes. The resultant semi-transparent oil was dried under vacuum until a foamy white solid was obtained. GPC analysis of the intermediate was carried out and the polymer was used without further purification. The polymer was subsequently dissolved in acetonitrile, transferred to a Teflon-plug sealable tube and chilled to 0° C. Trimethylamine was added to start the quaternization process. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours in the sealed tube. Precipitation of an oily material was observed during the course of reaction. The mixture was evacuated to dryness under vacuum and freeze-dried to finally yield a white crisp-foamy solid. The final polymer is characterized by 1H NMR to determine the final composition and purity.
The polymerizations to form the cationic polymers was generally efficient and gave moderately high yields. In the case of MTC-BnCl, the reaction was quenched within 30 minutes. MTC-PrBr reactions typically required up to 4 hours. All pre-quaternized polymers were subjected to GPC analysis and all of them were unimodal with PDI<1.3, indicating well-controlled polymerization. Proton NMR analysis of the final quaternized polymers was also consistent with the formulations.
Table 6 lists the cationic random copolymers prepared with MTC-VitE and BnOH initiator, their degree of polymerization (DP), quaternizing agent, CMC, and the total number of carbons of each cationic subunit. For each polymer in Table 6, m'=1.

Preparation of Triblock Copolymers
The organocatalytic ring opening polymerization (ROP) of MTC-VitE, initiated by poly(ethylene glycol) (HO-PEG-OH) was achieved using DBU/thiourea catalysts combination according to the Scheme 2.
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00132.TIF </img>
The ring opening polymerizations (ROP) with MTC-VitE were incomplete and the conversion efficiency was around 60%. The excess monomers and reagents were removed by repeated precipitation with diethyl ether. The final compositions of the polymers were confirmed by comparison of the OCH2-CH2 peak of PEG to the four CH3 peaks on the MTC-VitE hydrophobic tail. The hydrophobicity of the polymer can be adjusted by varying the amount of MTC-VitE moiety. The hydrophilicity can be adjusted by varying the HO-PEG-OH length. The triblock copolymers was not endcapped.
Examples 9 to 14
The formation of Example 11, VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, is representative. In a 20-mL vial containing a magnetic stir bar in the glove box, MTC-VitE (58.9 mg, 100 micromoles, 4.0 equivalent), HO-PEG-OH (Mn=20 kDa, 500 mg, 25 micromoles, 1.0 equivalent) and TU (9.3 mg, 25 micromoles, 1.0 equivalent) were dissolved in dichloromethane (4 mL). To this solution, DBU (3.7 microliters, 25 micromoles, 1.0 equivalent) was added to initiate polymerization. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature and aliquots of samples were taken to monitor the monomer conversion and evolution of molecular weight by 1H NMR spectroscopy and SEC. After 120 minutes, the reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of excess (˜20 mg) of benzoic acid and was precipitated into ice-cold diethyl ether (2×50 mL). The resultant polymer was dried in a vial for about 1-2 days until a constant sample mass was obtained, as white powder.

Preparation of Fluconazole Solutions
<img> id-US20180117162A1-20180503-C00134.TIF </img>
For antimicrobial studies, fluconazole was dissolved using sterile HPLC grade water at the appropriate concentrations. For example, a solution containing 5 mg/L fluconazole was formed by adding sterile HPLC grate water to a stock solution (1 g/L) of fluconazole.
Rheological Characterization
Rheological analysis of the hydrogels was performed on an ARES-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments, USA) equipped with a plate-plate geometry of 8 mm diameter. Measurements were taken by equilibrating the hydrogels at 25° C. between the plates at a gap of 1.0 mm. The data were collected under controlled strain of 0.2% and a frequency scan of 1.0 to 100 rad/sec. The shear storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″) of hydrogels were measured at each point. For shear-thinning studies, the viscosity of the hydrogels was monitored as a function of shear rate from 0.1 to 10 sec−1. From the storage modulus G', the molar weight between the effective cross-links, Mc, was calculated using the following equation:
<in-line-formulae>G'=ρRT/Mc </in-line-formulae>
where ρ is the polymer concentration [g/m3], R is the molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.
Restoration of elastic modulus of hydrogel after network disruption was studied by applying high strain of 100% for 200 seconds and monitoring the changes in G' and G″ at a constant frequency of 1 rad/sec.
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) Imaging
To minimize morphological perturbations, the hydrogels were cryo-fixed by transferring the sample into a chamber filled with liquid nitrogen. A day of freeze-drying process was then followed. The morphology of the gel was observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Jeol JSM-7400F, Japan).
In Vitro Release of Sodium Nicotinate from Hydrogel
The release of sodium nicotinate from the hydrogels was studied using the dialysis method. Dialysis membrane tube with molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of 500 Da (Spectrum Laboratories, U.S.A.) containing 0.5 mL gel was immersed in 25 mL of the release medium (i.e., PBS (pH 7.4)). This was shaken in a water bath at 100 rpm at 37° C. At designated time intervals, 0.5 mL of the release medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. The medium that has been removed was mixed with HPLC mobile phase consisting of 50 mM KH2PO4 (adjusted to pH 7.0) and methanol in the volume ratio of 99:1. Drug content was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 996 PDA detector, U.S.A.) at 220 nm UV wavelength.
In vitro release of herceptin from hydrogel
Herceptin-loaded hydrogels were transferred to Transwell inserts (Corning, U.S.A.). The inserts were then immersed in 25 mL of the release medium (i.e., PBS (pH 7.4)). This was kept shaking in a water bath at 100 rpm at 37° C. At designated time intervals, 0.1 mL of the release medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. The released amount of herceptin was quantified using the protein quantification BCA assay (Pierce, U.S.A.).
In Vitro Release of Doxycycline from Organogel
Doxycycline-loaded organogels were transferred to Transwell inserts (Corning, U.S.A.). The inserts were then immersed in 25 mL of the release medium (either PBS pH 7.4 or 1×104 U/L lipase solution in PBS pH 7.4). This was kept shaking in a water bath at 100 rpm at 37° C. At designated time intervals, 1.0 mL of the release medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. The release medium was completely exchanged with fresh medium after each overnight of incubation to maintain the activities of the lipase. The medium that was collected was mixed with HPLC mobile phase consisting of 25 mM KH2PO4:acetonitrile in the volume ratio of 30:70 (adjusted to pH 3.0). Drug content was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, Waters 996 PDA detector, U.S.A.) at 260 nm UV wavelength.
Cytotoxicity Study of Hydrogel Using MTT Assay
Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 2×104 cells per well, and cultivated in 100 microliters of growth medium. The plates were then returned to incubators for 24 hours to reach 70% to 80% confluency before treatment. When the desired cell confluency was reached, the spent growth medium was removed from each well and replaced with 50 microliters of fresh medium and 50 microliters of hydrogel, and incubated for 24 hours. Each condition was tested in four replicates. When the treatment was completed, the culture medium was removed and 10 microliters of MTT solution was added with 100 microliters of fresh medium. The plates were then returned to the incubator and maintained in 5% CO2, at 37° C. for a further 3 hours. The growth medium and excess MTT in each well were then removed. 150 microliters of DMSO was then added to each well to dissolve the internalized purple formazan crystals. An aliquot of 100 microliters was taken from each well and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The plates were then assayed at 550 nm and reference wavelength of 690 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, U.S.A.). The absorbance readings of the formazan crystals were taken to be those at 550 nm subtracted by those at 690 nm. The results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of the control cells without any treatment.
Cytotoxicity Study of Organogel Using MTT Assay
Human dermal fibroblasts were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 6×104 cells per well, and cultivated in 500 microliters of growth medium. The plates were then returned to incubators for 24 hours to reach 70%-80% confluency before treatment. When the desired cell confluency was reached, the spent growth medium was removed from each well and replaced with 500 microliters of fresh medium. 50 microliters of organogel was then added into Transwell inserts (Corning, U.S.A.) and immersed into the culture medium. The cells were then incubated for 24 hours with the organogels. Each condition was tested in 3 replicates. When the treatment was completed, the culture medium was removed and 10 pl of MTT solution was added with every 100 microliters of fresh medium. The plates were then returned to the incubator and maintained in 5% CO2 at 37° C. for 3 hours. The growth medium and excess MTT in each well were then removed. 600 microliters of DMSO was then added to each well to dissolve the internalised purple formazan crystals. An aliquot of 100 microliters was taken from each well and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The plates were then assayed at 550 nm and reference wavelength of 690 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, U.S.A.). The absorbance readings of the formazan crystals were taken to be those at 550 nm subtracted by those at 690 nm. The results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of the control cells without any treatment.
Mechanical Properties of Hydrogels and Organogels
The influence of concentration, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and chemical composition of the amphiphilic copolymers was investigated using dynamic mechanical analysis. Polymer concentration strongly affects the storage modulus G' of the hydrogel. FIGS. 1A to 1D are graphs showing the mechanical properties of blank hydrogels. FIG. 1A is a graph showing the storage (G') and loss (G″) moduli of blank hydrogels containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 in HPLC water (Example 15 and Example 16, respectively). FIG. 1B is a graph showing the storage (G') and loss (G″) moduli of blank hydrogels containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 in HPLC water (Example 17 and Example 18, respectively). FIG. 1C is a graph showing the viscosity dependence on shear rate of blank hydrogels containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 in HPLC water (Example 15 and Example 16, respectively). FIG. 1D is a graph showing the viscosity dependence on shear rate of blank hydrogels containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 in HPLC water (Example 17 and Example 18, respectively).
As shown in FIG. 1A doubling the concentration (4 to 8 wt. %) results in 4 to 10 times higher G' values. In particular, the 8 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 gel has a storage modulus G' of about 12000 Pa, which is nearly 10-fold greater compared to the 4 wt. % gel (G' 1400 Pa). The influence of the balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions of the polymers on the gel stiffness can be seen at higher polymer concentration. An increase in the MTC-VitE subunits from 1.25 to 2.5 at a concentration of 8 wt. % in HPLC grade water results in an increase in the storage modulus G' from about 5000 Pa to about 12000 Pa. The molecular weight between physical crosslinks Mc was determined, summarized in Table 11. Hydrogels with increasing polymer concentration displayed lower Mc values, which corresponds to lower molecular weight between crosslinks and higher crosslink density.

The hydrogel viscosity dependence on shear rate at 25° C. of FIG. 1C (Examples 15 and 16) and FIG. 1D (Examples 17 and 18) clearly demonstrate the shear-thinning properties of the gels. Shear thinning results from disruption of physical crosslinks between the polymer chains with the application of shear stress. Shear-thinning is desirable for both topical and injectable applications.
FIG. 1E shows the viscosity dependence on shear rate for 10 wt. % organogels prepared with VitE6.5-PEG(20k)-VitE6.5 (Example 19) and VitE8.5-PEG(20k)-VitE8.5 (Example 20) in KOLLIPHOR RH40. The organogels display high viscosity at low shear rates, indicating a firm, well-bodied structure. At the shear rate increases, the viscosity of the gels falls drastically to become a thin liquid. This indicates the organogel can be well-spread over the skin for topical delivery of therapeutic compounds.
In order for hydrogels to be used as an injectable drug depot, it is essential that the low viscosity solution phase rapidly form a gel when the shear force terminates. To study this property, a dynamic step strain amplitude test (y=0.2 or 100%) was applied on the VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 (4 wt. %) hydrogel in HPLC grade water (Example 15, labeled −Herceptin in FIG. 2) and the herceptin-loaded hydrogel (Example 24, labeled +Herceptin in FIG. 2. The graph of FIG. 2 shows that the initial G' was about 1400 Pa at a small strain (y=0.2%). When subjected to a high strain (y=100%), the G' value immediately decreased by more than 20 times to −67 Pa at 25° C. After 200 seconds of the continuous stress, the strain was returned to y=0.2% and the G' was immediately recovered to about 1400 Pa without any loss at 25° C. This dynamic step strain test mimics the pushing action during clinical administration into the subcutaneous tissue at 25° C. The reversibility of rheological behavior of the hydrogel is advantageous for use as an injectable matrix for delivery of therapeutics.
SEM Imaging of Hydrogel
Hydrogels were formed in deionized (DI) water and rapidly transferred into a chamber filled with liquid nitrogen. The frozen hydrogels were freeze-dried for a day and then imaged. Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) images of the hydrogel (FIGS. 3A to 3D) shows that the cross-section morphology and porosity of the hydrogel network is strongly influenced by the polymer concentration, hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance and chemical composition. FIGS. 3A and 3B are SEMS of blank hydrogels of VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 at 4 wt. % (Example 15) and 8 wt. % (Example 16) concentration in HPLC grade water, respectively. FIGS. 3C and 3D are SEMS of blank hydrogels of VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 at 4 wt. % (Example 17) and 8 wt. % (Example 18) concentration in HPLC grade water, respectively. Long flexible fibers are present in large proportion in 4 wt. % hydrogels of both VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-Long flexible fibers are present in large proportion in 4 wt. % hydrogels of both VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 (FIG. 3A) and VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 (FIG. 3C), and this is most likely due to the entanglement of the PEG chains. These long flexible fibers vary in diameter from about 0.1 to about 1 micrometer). Nanosized (<1 micrometer) spherical structures that occur along the lengths of the fibers, which might be micelles that are formed during the self-assembly process of the polymers. At 8 wt. % concentration the hydrogels appear as nanophase-separated sponge structures (FIGS. 3B and 3D). The porosity of the sponge structures appear to be different at different polymer concentrations. At 4 wt. %, the hydrogels appear to be more porous compared to the 8 wt. % hydrogel.
Drug Release from Hydrogel and Organogels
FIG. 4A is a graph plotting the release rate of sodium nicotinate from loaded hydrogels Example 21 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.3 wt. % sodium nicotinate), Example 22 (containing 8 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.3 wt. % sodium nicotinate), and Example 23 (containing 4 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 and 0.3 wt. % sodium nicotinate). The loaded hydrogels were studied by immersing the hydrogels in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) at 37° C. and measuring the concentration of nicotinate in the PBS solution over time. A higher triblock copolymer concentration results in significantly slower release of sodium nicotinate (FIG. 4A) from the hydrogel, possibly due to the lower porosity of the gel matrix, which results in slower diffusion of the drug molecules through the gel. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance of the copolymers also affects the release profiles. From FIG. 4A, 4 wt. % of VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 (Example 23) shows faster release of sodium nicotinate compared to 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 (Example 21). Without being bound by theory, this is possibly due to the lower hydrophilicity of VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5, which might result in a lower extent of intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the polymer and sodium nicotinate molecules.
Large biomolecules exhibit a similar trend in release profile. FIG. 4B is a graph plotting the release rate of herceptin from loaded hydrogels Example 24 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) and Example 25 (containing 4 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin). A large difference in herceptin release rates is observed. Ninety percent of the protein is released in 48 hours from 4 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 (Example 25) hydrogel while the same amount of release from VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 (Example 24) gel is completed in 312 hours.
The release of doxycycline (DXY) was investigated by immersing the organogels in PBS and measuring the concentration of doxycycline in the PBS solution over time. Lipase was added to the release medium in attempt to accelerate the degradation of the organogels. FIG. 4C is a graph plotting the release rate of doxycycline from organogels Example 26 (containing 10 wt. % VitE6.5-PEG(20k)-VitE6.5 and 1.0 wt. % doxycycline) and Example 27 (containing 10 wt. % VitE8.5-PEG(20k)-VitE8.5 and 1.0 wt. % doxycycline), with and without lipase. The presence of lipase did not lead to an increase in the release of doxycycline until hour 77 when close to 20% more antibiotic was released in the enzyme-containing medium with VitE6.5-PEG(20k)-VitE6.5 (Example 26) and VitE8.5-PEG(20k)-VitE8.5 (Example 27). In the presence of lipase, degradation of the organogels could have occurred, resulting in similar amount of antibiotic (˜75%) being released from the two polymers. After 77 hours, multiple peaks of the drug showed up on the HPLC chromatogram indicating drug degradation. No further measurements were made.
In Vitro Biocompatibility Study
The hydrogels were assessed for their in vitro biocompatibility by culturing human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells in the presence of hydrogels and organogels for 24 hours. FIG. 5 is a bar graph showing the percentage of viable HDF cells after treatment with blank hydrogel Examples 15 and 16 (containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, respectively) and blank hydrogel Examples 17 and 18 (containing 4 wt. % and 8 wt. % VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5). The hydrogels of lower concentration (4 wt. %) did not exert any toxicity on the cells. However, cell viability with 8 wt. % of VitE2.5-PEG(20k)-VitE2.5 hydrogel (Example 18) was about 75%. Without being bound by theory, this might be due to the high stiffness (G'˜12000) and lower porosity of the hydrogel (see FIG. 3D), which leads to slower diffusion of nutrients to the cells and exclusion of metabolites from the cellular environment.
FIG. 6 is a bar graph showing the percentage of viable human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells after treating the cells with blank organogel Example 19 (containing 10 wt. % VitE6.5-PEG(20k)-VitE6.5), doxycycline loaded hydrogel Example 26 (containing 10 wt. % VitE6.5-PEG(20k)-VitE6.5 and 1 wt. % doxycycline), blank organogel Example 20 (containing 10 wt. % VitE8.5-PEG(20k)-VitE8.5), and doxycycline loaded hydrogel Example 27 (containing 10 wt. % VitE8.5-PEG(20k)-VitE8.5 and 1 wt. % doxycycline).
Cytotoxicity of Herceptin Delivered by Hydrogels Against Various Cell Lines
Herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) was tested against HER2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer BT474 cells, low HER2/neu-expressing human breast cancer MCF7 cells and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) to investigate the treatment specificity as well as in vitro biocompatibility of the hydrogel. HER2/neu is also known as c-erbB-2.
Human dermal fibroblasts, MCF7 and BT474 cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 6×104 cells per well, and cultivated in 500 microliters of growth medium. The plates were then returned to incubators for 24 hours to reach ˜70% confluency before treatment. When the desired cell confluency was reached, the spent growth medium was removed from each well and replaced with 500 microliters of fresh medium together with 50 microliters of the hydrogel in a Transwell insert and incubated for either 48 or 120 hours. Each condition was tested in four replicates. When the treatment was completed, the culture medium was removed and 50 microliters of MTT solution was added with 500 microliters of fresh medium. The plates were then returned to the incubator and maintained in 5% CO2, at 37° C., for a further 3 hours. The growth medium and excess MTT in each well were then removed. 600 microliters of DMSO was added to each well to dissolve the internalised purple formazan crystals. An aliquot of 100 microliters was taken from each well and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The plates were then assayed at 550 nm and reference wavelength of 690 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, U.S.A.). The absorbance readings of the formazan crystals were taken to be those at 550 nm subtracted by those at 690 nm. The results were expressed as a percentage of the absorbance of the control cells without any treatment.
FIG. 7 is a bar graph showing the percent of viable HER2/neu-overexpressing human breast cancer BT474 cells as a function of herceptin concentration after treating the cells with (a) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 48 hours, (b) herceptin solution for 48 hours, (c) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 120 hours, (d) and herceptin solution for 120 hours, each performed using a herceptin concentration of 0.0005 wt. %, 0.002 wt. %, 0.01 wt. %, 0.05 wt. %, 0.1 wt. %, and 0.5 wt. %. The herceptin loaded hydrogels were prepared using the procedure of Example 24. FIG. 7 shows that 48 hour treatment was insufficient for herceptin to exert sufficient killing effect on BT474 cells. About 65% of the BT474 cells still remained viable at even at the highest herceptin concentration tested (i.e., 5 g/L). Interestingly, when the treatment was extended to 120 hours, the IC50 of herceptin delivered using the hydrogel was drastically reduced to 0.02 g/L, whereas the blank hydrogel has minimal cytotoxicity. IC50 is the half maximal inhibitory concentration, and is a quantitative measure of how much of a particular drug or other substance (inhibitor) is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e., an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. The IC50 of the solution formulation of herceptin was lower, <0.005 g/L. Without being bound by theory, the higher IC50 value of the hydrogel formulation might be due to the release kinetics of herceptin from the hydrogel. About 50% of the initial amount of herceptin was released by 5 days (i.e., 120 hours), and furthermore, the cumulative cytotoxic effect would also be reduced over the 5-day period as compared to the bolus delivery of herceptin solution. The herceptin-loaded hydrogel was highly effective in killing BT474 cells at high herceptin concentrations (≥1 g/L), where more than 70% of the cells were killed in 120 hours. Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that herceptin has a half-life of 6.2 to 8.3 days, and with the sustained release profile of herceptin from the hydrogel for more than 2 weeks, it is anticipated that the hydrogel would be able to deliver a continuous supply of antibody in vivo and eradicate HER2+ tumors.
FIG. 8 is a bar graph showing the viability of MCF7 cells as a function of herceptin concentration when treated with (a) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 48 hours, (b) herceptin solution for 48 hours, (c) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 120 hours, (d) and herceptin solution for 120 hours, each performed using a herceptin concentration of 0.0005 wt. %, 0.002 wt. %, 0.01 wt. %, 0.05 wt. %, 0.1 wt. %, and 0.5 wt. %. Herceptin loaded hydrogels were prepared using the procedure of Example 24. With MCF7 cells, herceptin delivered either in the hydrogel or solution formulation shows negligible cytotoxic effect with more than 80% cell viability even after 120 hours treatment at up to herceptin concentration of 5 g/L. This demonstrates that the herceptin treatment was specific towards HER2/neu-overexpressing cancer cells.
FIG. 9 is a bar graph showing the viability of human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells as a function of herceptin concentration when treated with (a) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 48 hours, (b) herceptin solution for 48 hours, (c) herceptin loaded hydrogel (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) for 120 hours, (d) and herceptin solution for 120 hours, each performed using a herceptin concentration of 0.0005 wt. %, 0.002 wt. %, 0.01 wt. %, 0.05 wt. %, 0.1 wt. %, and 0.5 wt. %. The herceptin loaded hydrogels were prepared using the procedure of Example 24. The antibody solution showed slight cytotoxicity against HDF at 5 g/L after 120 hours of treatment. It is possible that the interaction of herceptin with the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR/ErbB) on the HDR cells causes slight hinderence to HDF cell proliferation. Herceptin-loaded hydrogel did not show significant cytotoxicity at 5 g/L due to the sustained release of herceptin (only ˜60% herceptin released from the gel after 120 hours). Furthermore, the blank hydrogels showed no cytotoxicity toward HDF even after 120 hours of treatment, indicating in vitro biocompatibility.
In Vivo Biocompatibility and Gel Degradation Studies
In order for the vitamin E-functionalized polymeric hydrogel to serve as drug delivery depot, it is crucial that the hydrogel be biocompatible in vivo. To evaluate this property, subcutaneous injection of the blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) was carried out in mice.
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved protocol from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Biological Resource Centre of Singapore. Female BALB/c mice, weighing 20 g to 25 g were injected subcutaneously with 150 microliters of blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25). At predetermined periods, mice were sacrificed and the hydrogel and its surrounding tissue were isolated. For histological examination, samples were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and then stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) using standard techniques. To identify the inflammatory cells populated in the subcutaneous tissue and hydrogel, immunohistochemical staining was carried out using a monoclonal rat anti-mouse antibody CD45R (BD Biosciences, U.S.A.) that recognizes the leukocyte common antigen (CD45). The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) to visualize cell nuclei and examined using a stereomicroscope (Nikon, U.S.A.).
Histological sections of the hydrogel treated and surrounding mice tissue were examined at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks post injection (FIG. 10, optical photomicrographs of stained tissue). Within 2 weeks post injection, the hydrogel remained mostly intact (arrows in FIG. 10) and some inflammatory cells (indicated by darker DAB stains shown in the dashed circles) had infiltrated into the hydrogel. At 4 weeks, the thickness of the hydrogel had reduced, indicating degradation of the hydrogel. By 6 weeks, the hydrogel had mostly degraded and there was a noticeable reduction in the number of CD45-positive cells in the hydrogel and surrounding tissue. This significant reduction in the number of leukocytes (inflammation-mediating cells) indicates that only mild in vivo tissue response occurred with the administration of hydrogel and the inflammatory response was only temporary and did not progress to a chronic phase.
Biodistribution of Herceptin Delivered Using Different Formulations
To evaluate its biodistribution, herceptin was first labeled using ALEXA FLUOR 790 (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). The ALEXA FLUOR dye, with a tetrafluorophenyl (TFP) ester moiety, was added to the antibody in a molar ratio of 15:1. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 30 minutes. Purification of the fluorescent conjugate was carried out via ultracentrifugation. The conjugate was then analyzed using the NANODROP ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, U.S.A.) and the degree of labeling was determined to be 1.45 moles ALEXA FLUOR dye per mole of herceptin.
BT474 tumor-bearing female BALB/c nude mice were used for this study. The mice were divided into 3 groups and administrated with herceptin in different formulations: (1) a herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 hydrogel and 0.5 wt. % herceptin) (“Herceptin-loaded hydrogel, S.C.”), (2) a herceptin solution injected subcutaneously at approximately 1 cm away from the tumor site (“Herceptin solution, S.C.”), and (3) a herceptin solution injected intravenously (“Herceptin solution, I.V.”). For preparation of (2) and (3) herceptin was dissolved in HPLC grade water at a concentration of 5 g/L.
Anesthetic animals were placed on an animal plate heated to 37° C. The near-infrared fluorescence was imaged using the ICG filter pairs and exposure time was set to 1 sec. Scans were performed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10 and 13 days post administration. The mice were sacrificed on Day 13 and organs involved in drug clearance and metabolism as well as tumor tissue were excised and imaged using IVIS (Caliper Life Science, U.S.A.).
FIG. 11 is a series of mouse drawings showing the biodistribution of ALEXA FLUOR 790-labeled herceptin within the mice over a 13 day period. Comparison between the subcutaneous delivery using the hydrogel and the intravenous injection in solution shows that the subcutaneous injection was more favorable. The intravenous injection method resulted in herceptin accumulation mainly within organs such as kidneys, liver and lungs, but only a very little amount in the tumor tissue. When herceptin solution was injected subcutaneously at about 1 cm away from the tumor site, the antibody accumulated to a greater extent in the tumor compared to that in the intravenous injection case. This is most likely due to the proximity to the tumor tissue which allowed accessibility for herceptin to diffuse to the tumor. However, herceptin was still able to enter the circulation system and experience similar biodistribution as the intravenous administration. On the other hand, the hydrogel formulation provided localized delivery of herceptin, leading to a high amount of herceptin accumulation within the tumor and very little amount in the other organs. The biodistribution patterns of various formulations will likely influence their anti-tumor efficacy.
In Vivo Anti-Tumor Efficacy
To understand the therapeutic efficacy of herceptin delivery via different routes of administration, herceptin-loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1 wt. % herceptin) injected subcutaneously (S.C.) was compared to both intravenous (I.V.) and subcutaneous administration of herceptin solution in the BT474-tumor bearing mouse model. The mice were divided into 5 groups consisting of: control injected on the first day of treatment (Day 0) with HPLC grade water (S.C.); herceptin in solution delivered intravenously (I.V.); herceptin in solution delivered subcutaneously (S.C.); blank hydrogel (Example 15) delivered subcutaneously (S.C.) and herceptin-loaded hydrogel (Example 24) delivered subcutaneously (S.C.). Herceptin solution was prepared by using HPLC grade water to dissolve herceptin at 5 g/L. Subcutaneous injections were performed once per mouse at about 1 cm away from tumor sites. The administrated dosage of herceptin was 30 mg/kg in 150 microliters for all formulations.
Female BALB/c nude mice, weighing 18 g to 22 g were injected subcutaneously with 200 microliters of a cell suspension (1:1 with Matrigel) (BD Biosciences, U.S.A.) containing 5×106 BT474 cells. Three weeks after inoculation (when the tumor volume was 100 mm3 to 120 mm3), the tumor-bearing mice were randomly divided into several groups (7 to 10 mice per group).
In a first experiment, Group 1 mice were used as nontreated control, group 2 and 3 mice were given intravenous (30 mg/kg) and subcutaneous (150 microliters) injections of herceptin solution of concentration of 1.25 g/L in HPLC grade water, respectively, group 4 and group 5 mice were subcutaneous injections (150 microliters, 30 mg/kg) of blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % in VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) and herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin), respectively, at ˜1 cm away from the tumor site. All mice were injected only once on the first day of treatment (Day 0).
In a second experiment, Group 1b mice were used as nontreated control, Group 2b and 3b mice were given 4 doses of weekly intravenous and subcutaneous injections of herceptin (4×10 mg/kg), respectively while the Group 4b mice were injected once subcutaneously with herceptin-loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) at a dosage of 40 mg/kg on the first day of treatment (Day 0), respectively. For improved clinical relevance, the subcutaneous injections of herceptin solution and herceptin-loaded hydrogel were carried out at a remote site, ˜4 cm away from the tumor. The tumor size was measured by calipers in two orthogonal diameters and the volume was calculated as L×W2/2, where L and W are the major and minor diameters respectively. At the end of the treatment, a two-tailed Student's t test was used to statistically evaluate the difference in tumor volume and P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. In addition, the toxicities of the different formulations were evaluated by monitoring the change in mouse body weight over the course of treatment.
FIG. 12A is a graph showing the change in body weight of BT474-tumor bearing mice after one injection using various herceptin formulations, including blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) delivered subcutaneously (“Blank Gel”) herceptin solution delivered intravenously (“Herceptin Sol (IV, 30 mg/kg, Once”)), herceptin solution delivered subcutaneously (“Herceptin Sol (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”)), and herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) delivered subcutaneously (“Herceptin Gel (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”)). The herceptin dosage was 30 mg/kg. No weight loss was observed for all mice during the course of treatment, indicating good tolerance to all treatment conditions.
FIG. 12B is a graph showing change in tumor size of BT474-tumor bearing mice after one injection using various herceptin formulations, including blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) delivered subcutaneously (“Blank Gel”) herceptin solution delivered intravenously (“Herceptin Sol (IV, 30 mg/kg, Once”)), herceptin solution delivered subcutaneously (“Herceptin Sol (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”)), and herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) delivered subcutaneously (“Herceptin Gel (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”)). The herceptin dosage was 30 mg/kg. Measurement of tumor size with time reveals that the tumor growth inhibition by the solution and hydrogel formulations were different. Mice treated with blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, “Blank Gel”) had similar average tumor volume compared to the control group (P=0.56). This indicates that the blank hydrogel Example 15 did not exert any cytotoxic effect on the tumors. In sharp contrast, the herceptin-loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin, “Herceptin Gel (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”) reduced the tumor by about 77% (P=0.01) compared to the control group. It is noteworthy that mice treated with the herceptin loaded hydrogel were the only group that showed tumor shrinkage. This can be seen by comparing the tumor size on the initial and final day of treatment course (P<0.001). Furthermore, the anti-tumor efficacy was much more pronounced with the hydrogel treatment compared to treatment using herceptin solutions delivered intravenously (“Herceptin Sol (IV, 30 mg/kg, Once”)) or subcutaneously (“Herceptin Sol (SC, 30 mg/kg, Once”)), with P values <0.005. Without being bound by theory, this is attributed to the herceptin-containing hydrogel having higher localized herceptin concentration at the tumor site over a longer period of time (as shown in FIG. 11), which enables herceptin to exert a more cytotoxic effect against the cancer cells.
Histological Analysis
At 28 days post injection of the herceptin formulations, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors as well as normal tissues (heart, lung, liver and kidney) were individually excised and dissected. For histological examination, the samples were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and then stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) using standard techniques. Apoptotic cells of tumor samples were identified using Terminal Transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. The slides were counterstained with hematoxylin to visualize nuclei and examined using a stereomicroscope (Nikon, U.S.A.).
The TUNEL assay reveals apoptotic cells (as a brown 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stain) by detecting DNA fragmentation resulting from apoptosis. FIG. 13 is a series of photomicrographs showing tumor cells of BT474-tumor bearing mice after terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining at 28 days after one injection using various herceptin formulations, including blank hydrogel Example 15 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25) delivered subcutaneously (“Blank Gel (S.C.)”), herceptin solution delivered intravenously (“Her Sol (I.V.)”), herceptin solution delivered subcutaneously (“Her Sol (S.C.”)), and herceptin loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) delivered subcutaneously (“Her Gel (S.C.”)). The herceptin dosage was 30 mg/kg. The scale bar represents 100 micrometers. The color version of the photomicrographs of FIG. 13 shows that tumor cells treated with herceptin, regardless of the formulation used, were mostly apoptotic, indicating that anti-tumor mechanism was based on herceptin-induced apoptosis. H&E staining shows that treatment using herceptin-loaded hydrogel resulted in fewer cells remaining. This further illustrates the higher anti-tumor efficacy of the subcutaneous delivered herceptin-loaded hydrogel.
In addition, the anti-tumor efficacy of one-time subcutaneous injection of herceptin-loaded hydrogel was compared to weekly intravenous and subcutaneous injections of herceptin solution. Importantly, the subcutaneous injections were done at a remote site (about 4 cm away from the tumor) to increase clinical relevance of the study. The total herceptin dosage was 40 mg/kg in each group. At the end of the treatment, a two-tailed Student's t test was used to statistically evaluate the differences in tumor volume and P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.
FIGS. 14A and 14B are graphs showing the changes in tumor size (FIG. 14A) and mouse body weight (FIG. 14B) of BT474-tumor bearing mice after four weekly administrations of herceptin solution delivered intravenously (“Herceptin Sol (IV, 4×10 mg/kg, Weekly”) and subcutaneously (“Herceptin Sol (IV, 4×10 mg/kg, Weekly”), compared to herceptin loaded hydrogel (Example 24) delivered once subcutaneously (“Herceptin Gel (SC, 40 mg/kg, Once”). For the group treated with herceptin solution, the tumor remained similar in size over the 28 day period.
The tumor reduction provided by the subcutaneously delivered herceptin-loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) is significantly greater compared to the subcutaneously delivered herceptin solution (FIG. 14A). For the herceptin solution group, tumors remained similar in size throughout the entire course of treatment, whereas for the hydrogel treated group, the tumor decreased by 30% (P=0.03) by the end of the treatment. Mouse body weight also remained relatively constant for each sample tested (FIG. 14B). Without being bound by theory, the superior anti-tumor efficacy of the hydrogel formulation is probably due to the protective environment provided by the hydrogel network, which greatly reduced the penetration into the subcutaneous region of proteolytic enzymes that can degrade herceptin.
During the early phase of treatment, the anti-tumor efficacy of the subcutaneously injected herceptin-loaded hydrogel Example 24 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 1.0 wt. % herceptin) was much more pronounced than the intravenous injected herceptin solution. The hydrogel-treated group had 61% tumor shrinkage (P<0.001) by Day 3, whereas the solution treated group showed reduction in tumor size only after 2 weeks from commencement of treatment. Interestingly, similar to the hydrogel-treated group, the mice injected with herceptin solution (intravenous) showed 32% tumor shrinkage (P=0.001) by the end of the treatment. FIG. 15 is a series of photomicrographs showing tumor cells of BT474-tumor bearing mice after TUNEL staining at 28 days post injection of herceptin in solution (intravenous and subcutaneous) and hydrogel (subcutaneous) formulations. The scale bar represents 100 micrometers. Herceptin solution delivered intravenously is labeled “Her Sol (I.V., weekly”). Herceptin solution delivered subcutaneously is labeled “Her Sol (S.C., weekly”). Herceptin loaded hydrogel (Example 24) delivered subcutaneously is labeled “Her Gel (S.C., one-time”). The weekly administration of herceptin might allow fresh supply of the antibody to enter the circulation, thereby compensating for the loss of bioactivity due to proteolysis and degradation in the body system. Therapeutic efficacy of the one-time injection of herceptin-loaded hydrogel was similar to weekly administration of herceptin in solution (intravenous) as the polymer matrix was able to entrap the antibody and release it in a sustained manner. Apoptosis and significant reduction in the number of cancer cells was observed for both treatment conditions. With regards to clinical relevance, the frequency of injections can be drastically reduced via the use of hydrogel, providing greater convenience in administration over the other formulations.
FIG. 16 is a series of photomicrographs of mice heart, lung, liver and kidney cells after H&E staining at 28 days post injection of herceptin solution formulations (intravenous and subcutaneous) performed on a weekly basis and herceptin loaded hydrogel (subcutaneous) injected once on the first day of treatment. The scale bar represents 100 micrometers. Pathological analysis of normal tissues (heart, lungs, liver and kidneys) resected from the mice revealed no toxicity.
Antimicrobial Properties
Killing Efficiency
Procedure for hydrogels: E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. albicans were obtained from ATCC and reconstituted from its lyophilized form according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacterial samples were cultured in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) solution at 37° C. under constant shaking of 300 rpm. C. albicans was culture in yeast medium at room temperature under constant shaking of 70 rpm. Prior to treatment, the bacterial sample was first inoculated and cultured to enter into log growth phase. To prepare the antimicrobial hydrogels, cationic polymer was first dissolved in filtered HPLC water in a bio-hood. The resultant solution was then added to solid triblock copolymer for dissolution and left to stand 4 hours at room temperature for the formation of the hydrogels (Example 28 and Example 29). For instance, cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) or cationic polymer VE/PrBr(1:30) was dissolved by using sterile HPLC grade water to form a polymer solution at various concentrations. This solution was then used to dissolve VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 to form a 4 wt. % hydrogel containing various concentrations of the cationic polymers.
For antimicrobial treatment, 50 microliter aliquots of the hydrogels incorporated with various amounts of cationic polymers were placed into the wells of a 96-well microplate. The concentration of bacterial solution was adjusted to give an initial optical density (O.D.) reading of approximately 0.07 at 600 nm wavelength on a microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland), which corresponds to the concentration of McFarland 1 solution (3×108 CFU/mL). The bacterial solution was then diluted and an equal volume of bacterial suspension (3×105) was added into each well. The 96-well plate was kept in an incubator at 37° C. under constant shaking of 300 rpm for 18 hours for E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and C. albicans. After treatment, the samples were taken for a series of tenfold dilution, and plated onto agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. and the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was counted. Bacteria treated in hydrogel without cationic polycarbonates were used as negative control, and each test was carried out in 3 replicates. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) is defined herein as the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial composition that eliminates >99.9% of the microbes.
Procedure for organogels: E. coli was obtained from ATCC and reconstituted from its lyophilized form according to the manufacturer's protocol. Bacterial samples were cultured in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) solution at 37° C. under constant shaking of 300 rpm. Prior to treatment, the bacterial sample was first inoculated and cultured to enter into log growth phase. For antimicrobial treatment, 20 microliters of the organogels (Example 26 and Example 27) containing 1 wt. % doxycycline was added to sterile vials. The concentration of bacterial solution was adjusted to give an initial optical density (O.D.) reading of approximately 0.07 at 600 nm wavelength on a microplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland), which corresponds to the concentration of McFarland 1 solution (3×108 CFU/mL). The bacterial solution was then diluted and an equal volume of bacterial suspension (3×105) was added into each vial and incubated at 37° C. under constant shaking of 300 rpm for 18 hours. After treatment, the samples were taken for a series of tenfold dilution, and plated onto agar plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours at 37° C. and the number of colony forming units (CFU) was counted. Bacteria treated with KOLLIPHOR RH40 were used as negative control, and each test was carried out in 3 replicates.
Analysis of Drug Interactions
To assess the antimicrobial effects of the drug combinations (e.g., cationic polymer/doxycylcine and/or cationic polymer/fluconazole) the checkerboard and isobologram method of analyzing drug interactions were used. For the checkerboard method, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FBC) was calculated for each component in each combination dose. The types and extent of interaction was determined by calculating the FBC index, which is the ratio of the MBC of a drug in combination and MBC of the drug alone. For two interacting drugs, A and B, the sum of the FBCs indicates the extent of the interaction. Synergy is defined as ΣFIC index ≤0.5. Indifference was defined as ΣFIC index of >0.5 but ≤4 and antagonism as a ΣFIC index of >4.0. As for the isobologram method, evaluation of drug interaction is performed at the MBC level. Using graphical analysis, the concentrations required to produce the effect of >99.9% killing efficiency are determined for each component and plotted on the x and y axes of a two-coordinate plot. A line is drawn to connect these two points and this is defined as the line of additivity. Thereafter, treatment is performed with the drugs in combination at varying concentrations. The concentrations of fluconazole and cationic polymer in the combination that provide the same effect are placed in the same plot. Effect of the drug interaction is determined according to the position of the points with respect to the line of additivity. Synergy, additivity, or antagonism is represented when the point is located below, on, or above the line, respectively.
Biofilm Formation and Treatment
S. aureus and E. coli were grown overnight in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 37° C. and diluted in TSB to 3×106 and 3×108 CFU/mL before use. C. albicans was grown overnight in yeast medium at room temperature and diluted to 3×105 CFU/mL before use. 100 microliters of the diluted cell suspension were then inoculated into each well of 96-well plate and cultured for 7 to 10 days depending on their growth rates. Due to differences in the rate of biofilm formation, S. aureus and C. albicans were kept shaking at 100 rpm, 37° C. and 50 rpm, 25° C., respectively. E. coli was incubated at non-shaking conditions at 37° C. The culture medium was changed every day with PBS being added to wash off the planktonic and loosely adhered cells before replacing with fresh medium. Treatment was carried out by first removing the spent medium. The biofilm was washed gently with PBS to remove the planktonic and loosely adhered cells. The biofilm was then incubated with 50 microliters of hydrogel composition for 24 hours.
Biomass Assay
The biomass left after treatment was analyzed using crystal violet (CV) staining assay. The spent medium and hydrogel was gently removed and the biofilm was gently washed with PBS to remove the planktonic cells. Fixation was carried out by adding 100 microliters of methanol to the biofilm and removed after 15 min. Following this, 100 microliters of crystal violet staining (0.1 w/v %) was added to the fixed biofilm and incubated for 10 minutes. Excess crystal violet was washed off thoroughly using HPLC water. The remaining crystal violet bound to the biofilm was extracted using 200 microliters of 33% glacial acetic acid. An aliquot of 150 microliters was then taken from each well and transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. The absorbance was then measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland).
XTT Reduction Assay
XTT assay was used for quantifying viable cells in the biofilms after hydrogel treatment by measuring the mitochondrial enzyme activity of the cells. It is based on the reduction of 2,3-bis (2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide (XTT) in the metabolically active microbial cells to a water soluble formazan. XTT solution (1 mg/mL) and menadione solution (0.4 mM) were individually prepared by dissolution in deionized water. Right before the assay, the two components were mixed together at a volume ratio of XTT:menadione 5:1. During the assay, medium was first removed and biofilm were carefully washed with PBS to remove the planktonic cells. 120 microliters of PBS and 14.4 microliters of the XTT-menadione mixture was then added to each well and incubated for 3 hours. An aliquot of 100 microliters was then taken from each well and transferred to a fresh 96-well plate. The absorbance was then measured at 490 nm using a microplate reader (Tecan, Switzerland).
Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FE-SEM)
After treatment, the biofilm was gently washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 minutes. Next, the biofilm was washed with DI water to remove the formaldehyde and a series of ethanol washes (35, 50, 75, 90, 95 and 100%) was carried for dehydration of the samples. After two days of air-drying the samples were mounted on carbon tape and coated with platinum for SEM analysis under a field emission scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM-7400F, Japan).
Mechanical Properties of Triblock Copolymer/Cationic Polymer Hydrogels
The effects of cationic polymers on the mechanical properties of hydrogel matrix were investigated. Cationic polymer (0.1 wt. %; equivalent to 1000 mg/L) was added during the formation of 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 hydrogel in HPLC water. FIG. 17A is a bar graph of G' values of cationic polymer loaded hydrogels Example 28 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.1 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) in HPLC water) and Example 29 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.1 wt. % cationic polymer VE/PrBr(1:30) in HPLC water). Also shown is blank hydrogel Example 15 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25). As shown in FIG. 17A, the G' values are in a range of 1400 Pa to 1600 Pa. There is little difference in stiffness between the blank hydrogel and the cationic polymer loaded hydrogels.
FIG. 17B is a graph of viscosity versus shear rate profile of the cationic loaded hydrogels of FIG. 17A. The cationic polymer loaded hydrogels (Example 28 and Example 29) display high viscosity at low shear rates, indicating a firm, well-bodied structure. At the shear rate increases, the viscosity of the gels falls drastically to become a thin liquid. This shear-thinning profile of the hydrogels results from the disruption of physical cross-links between the polymer chains with the application of shear stress. Consequently, this indicates that they can be well-spread over the skin for topical treatment of dermal infection.
Antimicrobial Activity Studies of ABA Triblock/Cationic Polymers Delivered Using Hydrogel
Antimicrobial activities of two cationic polymer loaded hydrogels were evaluated against S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans as representative models of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria and fungus respectively. These microbes are common pathogens that often manifest on dermal wounds, and can be treated via topical delivery of antibiotics to infected areas.
VE/BnCl(1:30) and VE/PrBr(1:30) were loaded into 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 hydrogels (Example 28 and Example 29, respectively). Due to the disparity in antimicrobial efficacies of the two cationic polymers, different concentration ranges were used for the preparation of the hydrogels. The hydrogels were challenged with an inoculum of 3×105 CFU/mL and proliferation capacity of the survived cells was then assessed 24 hours later via the spread plate technique. This method of examining the antimicrobial activity is akin to measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the cationic polymers in solution.
FIGS. 18A to 18C are bar graphs showing the killing efficiency against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Candida albicans (C. albicans), respectively, of cationic polymer loaded hydrogels containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and various concentrations of cationic polymers VE/BnCl(1:30) or VE/PrBr(1:30). The concentration indicated on the horizontal axis refers to cationic polymer. The results show that the cationic polymers delivered by hydrogel are broadly antimicrobial against bacteria and fungi.
Table 12 lists the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of the cationic polymer with and without triblock copolymer against S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. The MBC value refers to the amount of cationic polymer in mg/L. For the cationic polymer alone (Examples 2 and 8), the solution MBC value is equal to the solution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against each microbe.

Table 12 shows the presence of the triblock copolymer lowers the antimicrobial efficacy of the cationic polymer (i.e., increases the MBC relative to the cationic polymer alone). The loaded hydrogels are most effective in inhibiting Gram-positive S. aureus proliferation. S. aureus requires the lowest amount of each cationic polymer (MBC=156.2 mg/L for VE/BnCl(1:30) and 312.5 mg/L for VE/PrBr(1:30)). The cationic polymer loaded hydrogels were less able to inhibit the proliferation of Gram-negative E. coli (MBC=312.5 mg/L for VE/BnCl(1:30) and 2500 mg/L and VE/PrBr(1:30)). The antimicrobial effect on C. albicans (fungus) was intermediate to that of the two bacteria species (MBC=312.5 mg/L for VE-BnCl(1:30) and 625 mg/L for VE/PrBr(1:30)). The MBC value of the cationic polymer (Table 12) is lower than the concentrations at which the cationic polymers become hemolytic towards mammalian cells.
The loaded hydrogels are consistent with the solution properties of the cationic polymers alone. That is, the cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) exhibits greater antimicrobial/antifungal properties compared to VE/PrBr(1:30) whether delivered in solution or as a hydrogel complex.
Antimicrobial Activity of Doxycycline-Loaded Organogels
The antimicrobial effectiveness of drug-loaded organogels (Examples 26 and 27) was tested on E. coli. E. coli strains from skin and soft tissue infections can exhibit strong virulence potential. FIG. 19 is a bar graph showing the number of viable bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) after 18 hour treatment of E. coli. with blank organogels (Examples 19 and 20, labeled “6.5VE-PEG20k-6.5VE” and “8.5VE-PEG20k-8.5VE”, respectively) and doxycycline loaded organogels (Examples 26 and 27, labeled “6.5VE-PEG20k-6.5VE 1 wt. % DXY” and “8.5VE-PEG20k-8.5VE 1 wt. % DXY”, respectively). The doxycycline loaded organogels demonstrated 100% bactericidal activity (0 CFU). Although the doxycycline concentration used is higher than the reported minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) range in several E. coli strains, 1 wt. % was selected because this is a typical loading content in clinically-approved doxycycline formulations such as NanoDOX® and ATRIDOX®.
Synergism of Fluconazole and Cationic Polymer VE/PrBr(1:15) Delivered by Solution
The following demonstrate synergistic enhancement of antimicrobial activity using cationic polymer VE/PrBr(1:15) in combination with fluconazole delivered via solution. Fluconazole (Fluc) is a member of the azole family of antifungal agents that possess good activity against C. albicans and exhibits low toxicity. While being considerably safe for clinical applications, the downside of using azoles is that they are only fungistatic, not fungicidal.
A stock solution of cationic polymer VE/PrBr(1:15) (5 mg) in sterile HPLC grade water (10 mL) was prepared having a final concentration of 500 mg/L (500 ppm). A second stock solution of fluconazole (1 mg) in sterile HPLC grade water (100 mL) was prepared having a final concentration of 10 mg/L (10 ppm). Three solutions were prepared: (1) cationic polymer alone at 1.0 MIC=250 mg/L (250 ppm) against C. albicans, (2) A cationic polymer/fluconazole solution containing VE/PrBr(1:15) at 0.5 MIC=125 mg/L (125 ppm) against C. albicans and fluconazole at 2.5 mg/L (2.5 ppm), and (3) fluconazole alone at 5.0 mg/L (5 ppm). Formulation (2) was obtained by combining 125 microliters each of the stock solutions of cationic polymer and fluconazole and diluting the resulting solution with 750 microliters of sterile HPLC grade water.
FIG. 20 is a bar graph showing the killing efficiencies of the three solutions against C. albicans. The cationic polymer solution (1) achieved 99.98% killing efficiency at 1.0 MIC=250 mg/L (250 ppm). The fluconazole solution (3) achieved 93.53% killing efficiency at 5.0 mg/L (5 ppm). However, solution (2) containing VE/PrBr(1:15) and fluconazole achieved 100% killing efficiency using VE/PrBr(1:15) at 0.5 MIC=125 mg/L (125 ppm) and fluconazole at 2.5 mg/L (2.5 ppm).
FIG. 21 is a graph (isobologram) demonstrating the synergy of the VE/PrBr(1:15)/fluconazole combination compared to VE/PrBr(1:15) alone and fluconazole alone delivered by solution against C. albicans. The synergy is indicated by the drug combination dose that lies to the left of the line of additivity, shown as a square inside the triangle.
Synergism of Fluconazole and Cationic Polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) Delivered by a Hydrogel
The following results demonstrate synergistic enhancement of antimicrobial activity against C. albicans using three component hydrogel containing VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) and fluconazole. Three hydrogels were compared: (1) fluconazole loaded hydrogel Example 30 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.05 wt. % fluconazole) used at a loaded hydrogel concentration of 500 mg/L, (2) cationic polymer/fluconazole loaded hydrogel Example 31 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, 0.0156 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30), and 0.001 wt. % fluconazole) used at a concentration of fluconazole=10 mg/L and VE/BnCl(1:30)=156 mg/L (0.5 MBC), and (3) cationic polymer/fluconazole loaded hydrogel Example 32 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, 0.0078 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30), and 0.004 wt. % fluconazole) used at a concentration of fluconazole=40 mg/L and VE/BnCl(1:30)=78 mg/L (0.25 MBC). FIG. 22 is a bar graph comparing the killing efficiency against C. albicans of the three hydrogels. Even at a high concentration of 500 mg/L, fluconazole alone was able to kill only 99.56% of C. albicans, whereas the drug combination of Example 31 used at a concentration of fluconazole=10 mg/L and VE/BnCl(1:30)=156 mg/L (0.5 MBC) killed 99.99% of C. albicans (FIG. 22, middle bar).
FIG. 23 is a graph showing the release rate of fluconazole from fluconazole loaded hydrogel Example 43 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.3 wt. % fluconazole, upper curve), and cationic polymer/fluconazole loaded hydrogel Example 44 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), 0.3 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30), and 0.3 wt. % fluconazole, lower curve). The results show that about 80% of the fluconazole was released within 4 hours from the two component hydrogel Example 43 (FIG. 23, upper curve), and about 40% of the fluconazole was released within about 7 hours from the three component hydrogel Example 44 (FIG. 23, upper curve).
By combining this fungistatic drug and cationic polymer in a hydrogel matrix, significant improvement in the therapeutic efficacy at two combination doses was observed. The FBC index of the combination doses was ˜0.5 and ˜0.25 respectively, indicating synergistic interaction from the codelivery of the two compounds. Furthermore, the isobologram method of analyzing drug interactions further illustrates the strong synergism between fluconazole and VE/BnCl(1:30) when delivered by the hydrogel. FIG. 24 is an isobologram demonstrating the synergy of the combination dosages (VE/BnCl(1:30)/fluconazole) for minimum bactericidal activity when delivered by loaded hydrogel Example 31 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), 0.0156 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30), and 0.001 wt. % fluconazole) and loaded hydrogel Example 32 (4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), 0.0078 wt. % cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30), and 0.004 wt. % fluconazole). Synergy between the cationic polymer and fluconazole is shown by the drug combination dosage lying to the left of the line of additivity for each loaded hydrogel, shown as a square inside the triangle. The upper square corresponds to Example 31, the bottom square corresponds to Example 32.
Synergism of Doxycycline (DXY)/Cationic Polymer Delivered by a Hydrogel
DXY is a tetracycline antibiotic. Loaded hydrogels were prepared with VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25, DXY, and cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30). The hydrogels were tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), a common pathogen in hospital patients with greater than 1 week stays. The MBC of DXY against P. aeruginosa is about 20-30 mg/L (30 ppm). The MBC of VE/BnCl(1:30) against P. aeruginosa is about 500 mg/L (500 ppm). Four hydrogels were prepared having DXY/VE/BnCl(1:30) ratios of 2.5 ppm/15.6 ppm (Example 33), 5 ppm/15.6 ppm (Example 34), 1 ppm/31.2 ppm (Example 35), and 2.5 ppm/31.2 ppm (Example 36), respectively. FIG. 25 is a bar graph showing that each hydrogel achieved 100% killing efficiency. FIG. 26 is an isobologram demonstrating the synergy of a doxycycline/cationic polymer against P. aeruginosa when delivered by loaded hydrogels Example 33 and Example 35, indicated by a drug combination dose to the left of the line of additivity, represented by a square inside the triangle. The left square corresponds to Example 35, the right square to Example 33. The drug combination is effective at extremely low doxycycline concentration (about 1 ppm, or 1 mg/L).
Biofilm Eradication by ABA Triblock/Cationic Polymer Hydrogels
The cationic polymer loaded hydrogels were investigated for their ability to eradicate biofilms. The formation of biofilms occurs as microbes adheres to a surface (inanimate material or tissue) and as they proliferate, they can secrete insoluble gelatinous exopolymers that results in a three-dimensional cell:polymer matrix known as a biofilm. Manifestation of medical biofilm can be extremely challenging as microbes growing in biofilms are recalcitrant and drastically less responsive to antimicrobial agents and host defense systems compared to the planktonic cells. Biofilm persistence can led to clinical conditions such as impaired wound healing, chronic inflammation and the spread of infectious emboli.
To establish relevance to antimicrobial agents used in biofilm elimination, various microbes (S. aureus, E. coli and C. albicans) were cultured for several days for the development of biofilm prior to the treatment. Cationic polymer VE/BnCl(1:30) or cationic polymer VE/PrBr(1:30) was loaded at MBC concentration for S. aureus, E. coli or C. albicans into VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 (4 wt. %) hydrogels and placed onto the biofilm. Cationic polymer loaded hydrogels Example 37 and Example 38 were prepared for S. aureus, cationic polymer loaded hydrogels Example 39 and Example 40 were prepared for E. coli, and cationic polymer loaded hydrogels Example 41 and Example 42 were prepared for C. albicans. The corresponding blank hydrogel Example 15 was used as a control. The culture was then incubated with the hydrogels for 24 hours for antimicrobial actions to occur. XTT assay was then performed to evaluate the viability of the remaining microbe. In this assay, a lower optical density (O.D.) reading corresponds to lower cell viability and better biofilm elimination capacities of the hydrogels.
FIGS. 27A and 27B are bar graphs showing the reduction in metabolic activity and biomass, respectively, of S. aureus biofilms by blank hydrogel Example 15 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 37 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0156 wt. % VE/BnCl(1:30)), and cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 38 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0625 wt. % VE/PrBr(1:30)). A reduction in metabolic activity (FIG. 27A) and biomass (FIG. 27B) was obtained with the cationic polymer loaded hydrogels against S. aureus.
FIGS. 28A and 28B are bar graphs showing the reduction in metabolic activity and biomass, respectively, of E. coli biofilms by blank hydrogel Example 15 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 37 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0156 wt. % VE/BnCl(1:30)), and cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 38 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0625 wt. % VE/PrBr(1:30)). A reduction in metabolic activity (FIG. 28A) and biomass (FIG. 28B) was obtained with the cationic polymer loaded hydrogels against E. coli.
FIGS. 29A and 29B are bar graphs showing the reduction in metabolic activity and biomass, respectively, of C. albicans biofilms by blank hydrogel Example 15 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25), cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 37 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0156 wt. % VE/BnCl(1:30)), and cationic polymer loaded hydrogel Example 38 (containing 4 wt. % VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 and 0.0625 wt. % VE/PrBr(1:30)). A reduction in metabolic activity (FIG. 29A and biomass (FIG. 29B) was obtained with cationic polymer loaded hydrogels against C. albicans.
It can be seen that hydrogels loaded with VE/BnCl(1:30) were as efficient as those loaded with VE/PrBr(1:30) in reducing the proliferation and viability of S. aureus (Gram-positive) and C. albicans (fungus). The major difference was observed in E. coli (Gram-negative) where cell treated with hydrogels loaded with the more hydrophobic VE/BnCl(1:30) had significantly lower viability compared to those treated with VE/PrBr(1:30)-loaded hydrogels.
The persistence of microbial biomass after treatment was quantified using the crystal violet assay. Any portion of the biofilm that remains can act as a dormant zone harboring pockets of microbes that stay protected from antimicrobial agents. Furthermore, there can also be subpopulations of resistant cells referred to as ‘persisters’ that may reside in the residual biofilm. The ability of the cationic polymer loaded hydrogels to eradicate biomass followed a trend similar to the trend in reduction of cell viability of the microbes residing in the biofilms. That is, VE/BnCl(1:30) had better antimicrobial action than VE/PrBr(1:30) against E. coli, and the two cationic polymers displayed similar efficiency against S. aureus and C. albicans biofilms.
SEM imaging demonstrates that biofilms treated with VE/BnCl(1:30)-loaded hydrogel (Example 37) showed extensive cell destruction and clearance (FIG. 30). Only ruptured cell fragments with the absence of intact cells remain for S. aureus and C. albicans. The images also correlate well to the quantification assays of cell viability and biomass where VE/BnCl(1:30) hydrogel is significantly more effective in eradicating E. coli biofilm compared to the VE/PrBr(1:30) counterpart.
Preparation and Testing of PEG-Diamine Based Block Copolymers
The term “PEG-diamines” is a general term that encompasses the more specific polymers PEG10DA and PEG20DA.
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of monomers and polymers were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 NMR spectrometer at 400 MHz at room temperature. The 1H NMR measurement parameters: acquisition time of 3.2 seconds, pulse repetition time of 2.0 seconds, 30° C. pulse width, 5208-Hz spectral width, and 32 K data points. Chemical shifts were referred to the solvent peak (6=7.26 for CDCl3).
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC). GPC analysis for polymers was carried out on a GPC system (Waters 2690, MA, U.S.A.) with an Optilab rEX differential refractometer detector (Wyatt Technology Corporation, U.S.A.) and Waters HR-4E column. The mobile phase used was THF with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Number-average molecular weights and polydispersity indices were calculated from a calibration curve obtained using a series of polystyrene standards (Polymer Laboratories Inc., MA, U.S.A., with molecular weight ranging from 1,350 to 151,700).
Rheological experiments. The hydrogels were prepared by dissolving the polymers (4.0 wt %, 5.0 wt %, 6.0 wt % and 8.0 wt %) in DI water at 25° C. The rheological analysis of the hydrogels was performed on an ARES-G2 rheometer (TA Instruments, U.S.A.) equipped with a plate-plate geometry of 8 mm diameter. Measurements were taken by equilibrating the gels at 25° C. between the plates at a gap of 1.0 mm. The data were collected under a controlled strain of 3.0% and a frequency scan of 1.0 to 100 rad/second. Gelation properties of the polymer solutions was monitored by measuring the shear storage modulus (G'), as well as the loss modulus (G″), at each point. To investigate the shear-thinning properties, the viscosity of the hydrogels was monitored as a function of shear rate from 0.1 to 10 sec−1.
The PEG-diamine-based block copolymers were prepared according to the following general reaction scheme using PEG10DA or PEG20DA.

The degree of polymerization (DP) of the central poly(ethylene oxide) block is designated by the subscript n, where n has an average value of about 250 (corresponding to the DP of PEG10DA) or 500 (corresponding to the DP of PEG20DA). The DP of each peripheral polycarbonate block is designated by the subscript m, which can have an average value of about 1 to about 10. The degree of conjugation of the cyclic carbonate monomer after the ROP is designated by the value 2×m.

Preparation of VitE1.05-PEG10DA-VitE1.05, m=1.05, n=250. The following procedure is representative. PEG10DA (Mn 10,790 Da, 0.216 g, 0.02 mmol) and MTC-VitE (0.115 g, 0.2 mmol) were added to a small vessel and mixed evenly.

Heating was continued for 36 hours, at which time the vessel was cooled to room temperature. The resulting mixture was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM, 2 mL). The resulting solution was poured into diethyl ether (40 mL) to precipitate the product. The precipitate was centrifuged and washed three times with diethyl ether. Finally, the wet solid was dried in vacuo, giving Vit1.05-PEG10DA-VitE1.05 as a white powder (0.21 g, 94%).

The Table 13 results indicate the use of organic solvent in the reaction led to an incomplete conjugation, and the catalyst-free enabled ease of purification and recycling of excess MTC-VitE and MTC-VitD2 monomers.
FIG. 31 (graph) shows the GPC diagrams of Vit1.05-PEG10DA-VitE1.05 (Example 45) and VitE1.8-PEG20DA-VitE1.8 (Example 46). The elution curves showed single unimodal peaks. No oligomer peaks were observed, indicating that no back-biting reactions took place under these conditions. Also, the block copolymers were found to be nearly monodisperse with a polydispersity of 1.10 and 1.08, respectively.
The compositions of the triblock copolymers were estimated from 1H NMR spectroscopy by quantitative comparisons between integral intensities of the peak of methyl protons of VitE or VitD2 and those of the ethylene groups of the central poly(ethylene oxide) block. FIG. 32 is a proton NMR spectrum of Example 45, Vit1.05-PEG10DA-VitE1.05, in CDCl3. The molar ratio of MTC-VitE to PEG10DA was determined to be 2.10 by comparison of the integral intensities of the peaks of methyl groups of the VitE fragment at 0.87 ppm with ethylene protons of the central poly(ethylene oxide) block at 3.64 ppm.
Hydrogels of the PEG-diamine base triblock copolymers were then prepared by dissolving a given block polymer in HPLC grade water at 25° C. at various concentrations. Table 14 summarizes the G' (storage modulus) and G″ (elastic modulus) values at a frequency of 1 Hz of hydrogels formed at 4, 5, 6, and 8 wt. % solids based on total weight of the hydrogel.

The polymer concentration significantly influenced the storage modulus G' of the hydrogels. Increasing the concentration led to higher storage moduli (G'), demonstrating that hydrogel stiffness can be easily tuned by varying polymer concentration. Also, as shown in FIG. 33 (graph), the hydrogels formed with Example 45 exhibited pronounced shear-thinning behaviour, facilitating its ability for topical application.
In Vitro Release of Herceptin from PEG-Diamine Based Block Copolymers
Loaded hydrogels (0.25 mL) containing herceptin (10 g/L) were prepared at 4 wt. % polymer as described further above. The loaded hydrogels were transferred to Transwell inserts (Corning, U.S.A.). No precipitation or leftover solution was seen after gelation, showing that all the Herceptin was loaded into the hydrogels. The inserts were then immersed in 25 mL of phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) release medium and were shaken using a water bath at 100 rpm at 37° C. At designated time intervals, 0.1 mL of the release medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. The released amount of Herceptin was quantified using the protein quantification BCA assay (Pierce, U.S.A.).
FIG. 34 (graph) shows that the release of Herceptin from a 4 wt. % hydrogel formed with Example 46 was sustained for 42 days with approximately 60% of the antibody being released cumulatively. The release occurred in a biphasic manner where about 45% of the antibody was released in the initial 15 days followed by a much slower release in the later phase. These data showed that Herceptin release from the gel was more sustained compared to block copolymers prepared with MTC-VitE using PEG-diol (compare FIG. 4B with FIG. 34)
In Vivo Biocompatibility and Gel Degradation Studies
All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the approved protocol from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Biological Resource Centre of Singapore. Female balb/c mice, weighing 20-25 g were injected with 150 μL of blank 4 wt. % hydrogel subcutaneously. For histological examination, the hydrogel and its surrounding tissue were isolated. At 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 6 weeks post injection, the hydrogel and its surrounding tissue was excised. The samples were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and then stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) using standard techniques. Optical photomicrographs of histological specimens were examined.
FIG. 35 is a set of photographs and staining images of the loaded hydrogel prepared with Example 46 in the mouse tissue at various times up to 6 weeks. Within the initial first week post-injection, the hydrogel (bracketed regions) remained largely intact. At 2 weeks post injection, there was reduction in gel thickness, which suggest that the hydrogel had begun to degrade. By 6 weeks, the hydrogel still remained visible during the excision procedure as well in H&E stained tissue sections, demonstrating that the degradation of this gel was slower than that of hydrogels prepared with MTC-VitE using PEG-diol.
CONCLUSIONS
Biodegradable and biocompatible vitamin E-functionalized “ABA”-type triblock copolymers were formed by organocatalyzed ring opening of cyclic carbonate monomers bearing a covalently bound form of a vitamin E compound. The block copolymers form physically cross-linked hydrogels and organogels without the addition of reagents or chemical reactions. The rheological properties of the gels can be readily tunable in facile manner by varying the polymer concentration or composition. Gel stiffness, indicated by the storage modulus G', can vary from 1000 to 12000 Pa depending on the polymer composition and/or concentration. A wide array of pharmaceutical compounds, including small molecule drugs, biomolecules and cosmetics/dietary products can be loaded into the gels during the gel formation process. These gels function as depots for delivery of drugs having controlled release profiles. With the ease of formulation and tunability, these soft physical gels serve as an attractive candidate for an extensive range of pharmaceutical-driven applications.
As one example, a biocompatible and biodegradable herceptin loaded hydrogel prepared with VitE1.25-PEG(20k)-VitE1.25 was successfully employed as an injectable local delivery material for the antibody. Rheological properties and porosity of the loaded hydrogel can be adjusted by varying the polymer composition and polymer concentration. Histological examination reveals that the hydrogel does not induce chronic inflammatory response, and is able to degrade in vivo over time. The hydrogel matrix provides sustained release of herceptin, and localizes the antibody within the tumor site. In vivo anti-tumor efficacy is significantly enhanced using a single subcutaneous injection of herceptin-loaded hydrogel at a site close to the tumor as compared to herceptin solution. Herceptin-loaded hydrogel injected once at a distal site away from the tumor is comparable to that of weekly intravenous administration of herceptin solution over 4 weeks. Herceptin treatment using the hydrogel requires less frequent injections, thereby providing greater convenience and improved patient compliance. These results suggest that the vitamin E-functionalized hydrogels hold promise for subcutaneous delivery of antibodies.
The cationic polymer loaded hydrogels are able to eradicate the biomass and greatly reduce viability of microbes residing in biofilms. Taken together, the results suggest that the cationic polymer loaded hydrogels can be used to eliminate both planktonic and biofilm microbes.
PEG-diamine based triblock copolymers, which have a carbamate linking group joining the blocks, were synthesized by bulk ring opening polymerization at elevated temperature without solvent or catalyst. The catalyst-free synthesis enables an easy purification step and recycling of excess monomers. These triblock copolymers formed hydrogels at 4 wt. % that showed pronounced shear-thinning behaviour suitable for medical injections. The hydrogel stiffness can be easily tuned by varying polymer concentration. Release was more sustained and controlled relative to PEG-diol based triblock copolymers, and the in vivo gel lifetime was longer for the PEG-diamine based polymers. The hydrogels have utility as injectable carriers for subcutaneous delivery of antibodies and other therapeutic drugs, or dressings for wound healing.
