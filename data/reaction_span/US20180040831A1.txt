FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention is related to an organic compound. In particular, the present invention is related to an organic compound for use in an electronic device.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
It is well known that the organic light emitting diode (OLED) was initially invented and proposed by the Eastman Kodak Company through a vacuum evaporation method. Tang and VanSlyke of the Kodak Company deposited an electron transport material such as Alq3 on a transparent indium tin oxide (abbreviated as ITO) glass formed with an organic layer of aromatic diamine thereon, and subsequently completed the fabrication of an organic electroluminescent (EL) device after a metal electrode was vapor-deposited onto the Alq3 layer. The organic EL device has become a new generation lighting device or display because of high brightness, fast response speed, light weight, compactness, true color, no difference in viewing angles, the lack of any LCD backlight plates, and low power consumption.
Recently, some interlayers such as an electron transport layer and a hole transport layer have been added between the cathode and the anode to increase the current efficiency and power efficiency of the OLEDs. For example, an OLED 100 shown as FIG. 1 includes a cathode 11, an electron injection layer 12, a light emitting layer 15, a hole transport layer 17, and an anode 18.
In the device function concept, the light emitted by the OLED 100 results from excitons produced by the recombination of electrons and holes in the light emitting layer 14. However, according to theoretical speculation, the ratio of the excitons with a singlet excited state and the excitons with a triplet excited state is 3:1. So, when a small molecular fluorescent material is used as the light-emitting layer 14 of the OLED 100, about 25% of the excitons are used to emit light, and the other 75% of the excitons in the triplet excited state are lost through a non-luminescence mechanism. For this reason, the general fluorescent material performs at a maximum quantum yield of 25%, a limit which amounts to an external quantum efficiency of 5% in the device.
Moreover, researchers further found that certain hole transport type materials can simultaneously perform electron confining, such as materials represented by the following Formulas 1' and 2'. Formula 1' represents the chemical structure of tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine, which is abbreviated TCTA. Formula 2 represents the chemical structure of N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine, abbreviated NPB.
In addition, for effective blue-emitting performance in OLED applications, researchers have developed hole-transporting type, blue-emitters based on triarylamine dimer regimes, such as IDE-102, N-STIF-N developed in my laboratory, and spirobifluorene-based systems. These materials are represented by the following Formulas 3', 4', and 5'.
Recently, to effectively increase the light emitting performance of OLEDs, OLED manufactures and researchers have made great efforts to develop electron transport materials with hole blocking functionality, such as TmPyPb, TPBi, 3TPYMB, BmPyPb, and DPyPA represented by following Formula 6'-10', respectively. TmPyPb is the abbreviation of 3,3'-[5'-[3-(3-Pyridinyl)phenyl][1,1':3',1″-terphenyl]-3,3″-diyl]bispyridine, TPBi is the abbreviation of 1,3,5-Tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene, 3TPYMB is the abbreviation of tris(2,4,6-triMethyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)borane, BmPyPb is the abbreviation of 1,3-bis(3,5-dipyrid-3-yl-phenyl)benzene, and DPyPA is the abbreviation of 9,10-bis(3-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl) anthracene.
In spite of various electron transport materials with hole blocking functionality having been developed, the phosphorescence OLEDs that use these electron transport materials still cannot perform outstanding luminous efficiency with a long device lifetime. Accordingly, because the conventional or commercial electron transport materials with hole blocking functionality still have drawbacks, the inventor of the present application has made great efforts to make inventive research and eventually discovered a series of quinoxaline-fused, spirally configured cis-stilbene/fluorene hybrid materials bearing cyanoaryl and/or cyano-heteroaryl subunits as hole-blocking type electron-transporters and emitters for the OLED.

Step 1:
Consecutively add 5505.9 mg (equivalent to 10.7 mmol) of Compound 11 represented by Formula 11, 15 ml of acetic acid and 1.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid into a reaction flask to form a solution. The color of the solution in the reaction flask will change to red. Install a reflux tube to the top of the reacting bottle. Put the reaction flask in an oil bath, at a temperature of about 120° C. After reacting for 30 minutes, the red color of the solution will fade and many precipitates will occur. The reaction flask is then lifted out of the oil bath and cooled down. Take off the reflux tube and use N-hexane to flush out the remaining silicon oil from the residue on the bottom. The residue on the bottom of the reaction flask is extracted using dichloromethane three times, each time with 50 ml, and water. The obtained organic extract solution is dried by adding magnesium sulfate, filtered, and then dried using rotary evaporation to withdraw the solvents to obtain a crude product. The crude product is purified by column chromatography using dichloromethane and water in a ratio of 1:3, and then further purified by recrystallization using dichloromethane and N-hexane, to obtain 4985.3 mg of solid Compound 12 represented by Formula 12, which is 3,7 -dibromo-5,5-spirofluorenyl-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene.

Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is then used to confirm that no reactants exist. The reaction flask is lifted out of the oil bath and cooled down. Take off the reflux tube and use N-hexane to flush out the remaining silicon oil from the residue on the bottom.

This means that these quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene derivatives possess excellent thermal stability, and will not easily decompose under high voltage or high current density operating conditions.
Moreover, the oxidation potential and the redox potential of Compounds 20-23 of these quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene derivatives can be measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). In Table 2, E1/2ox and E1/2red of the quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene derivatives are recorded.

A process for manufacturing an OLED device according to the present invention is described as follows. An aluminum substrate is cleaned by detergent. The cleaned aluminum substrate is loaded into a evaporation machine in a vacuum environment of about 7×10-6 torr to coat the cleaned aluminum substrate with various organic materials and metals listed in the following Table 3. The evaporation machine is purged with nitrogen and the coated substrate is removed for evaluation. Alternatively, an ITO glass can also be used to manufacture the OLED device. The ITO glass is cleaned and put into an evaporation machine. The various organic materials and metals can be deposited onto the ITO glass in a reverse sequence, to obtain the OLED device.
In order to prove that these proposed quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene hybrid materials can indeed be applied in OLEDs as a hole-blocking type electron transport layer and/or an emitting layer, a plurality of OLED devices for control groups and experimental groups were designed and manufactured, wherein the constituting layers for the OLED devices are shown in the following Table 3.

With reference to the measured data for the green phosphorescent OLED devices in Table 4, one can find that the OLED devices using a single hole transport layer from Experiments 1-4 show excellent ηext, ηc, ηp, and Lmax, and are much superior to the OLED devices with a single hole transport layer of Control 1A, Control 1B and Control 1C. Among them, Experiment 1 (CNΦQSΦCN) and 2 (PyQSPy) show the best results, where the ηext are in a range of 15.0-15.7%, ηc are in a range of 54.5-55.8 cd/A, ηp are in a range of 64.7-70.2 lm/w, and Lmax are in a range of 139,200-145,320 cd/m2.
In addition, the measured data also reveal that the OLED devices using a single hole transport layer in Experiment 5 and Experiment 6 show excellent ηext, ηc, ηp, and Lmax, which are superior to the OLED devices using complex (i.e., double) hole transport layer of Control 2 and Control 3. Moreover, the commercial OLED device using a complex hole transport layer (or called double hole transport layer) in Experiment 6 (PyQSPy) also shows excellent ηext, ηc, ηp, and Lmax, which is superior to the OLED devices using a complex hole transport layer of Control 2 and Control 3.
Furthermore, device life time evaluation tests for the green phosphorescent OLEDs were also completed based on a starting luminance of 10,000 cd/cm2. The life time evaluation test results reveal that the decay half lifetimes (LT50) of the green phosphorescent OLED in Experiment 5 and 6 are 15,500 and 16,840 hours. In addition, the decay half lifetime (LT50) for the green phosphorescent OLEDs of Control 1A and Control 3 were respectively measured as 1,000 hours and 13,500 hours. Moreover, after replacing the BmPyPb in the green phosphorescent OLEDs of Control 1A with the TmPyPb, the green phosphorescent OLEDs having the TmPyPb material was measured with the LT50 of only 210 hours.
Through the above descriptions, the quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene compound and its derivatives for OLEDs proposed in the present invention have been completely and clearly introduced. In summary, the present invention includes the advantages of:(1) The quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene hybrid materials are quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene compound and its derivatives with cayanoaryl and cyanoheteroaryl substituents with glass transition temperatures that range from 165° C. to 175° C., and decomposition temperatures that range from 413° C. to 421° C.(2) In addition, a variety of experimental data prove that these quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene compound and its derivatives can indeed be used as a hole-blocking type electron-transporter for OLEDs. Moreover, the experimental data also reveal that OLEDs using these quinoxaline-fused, spirally-configured cis-stilbene/fluorene compound and its derivatives used as the hole-blocking type electron-transporter show excellent external quantum efficiency (ηext), current efficiency (ηc), power efficiency (ηp), maximum luminance (Lmax), and device lifetime performance, which are all better than conventional or commercial OLEDs.
