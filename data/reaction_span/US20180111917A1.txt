FIELD
This disclosure concerns amide compounds, and embodiments of a method for making and using the compounds, such as for inhibiting interleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and for treating diseases and conditions related to IRAK.
BACKGROUND
Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) are important mediators of signaling processes, such as toll-like receptors (TLR) and interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling processes. IRAKs have been implicated in modulating signaling networks that control inflammation, apoptosis, and cellular differentiation. Four IRAK genes have been identified in the human genome (IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK3 and IRAK4), and studies have revealed distinct, non-redundant biological roles. IRAK1 and IRAK4 have been shown to exhibit kinase activity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
I. Definitions
The following explanations of terms and methods are provided to better describe the present disclosure and to guide those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present disclosure. The singular forms ‚Äúa,‚Äù ‚Äúan,‚Äù and ‚Äúthe‚Äù refer to one or more than one, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term ‚Äúor‚Äù refers to a single element of stated alternative elements or a combination of two or more elements, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. As used herein, ‚Äúcomprises‚Äù means ‚Äúincludes.‚Äù Thus, ‚Äúcomprising A or B,‚Äù means ‚Äúincluding A, B, or A and B,‚Äù without excluding additional elements. All references, including patents and patent applications cited herein, are incorporated by reference.
Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of components, molecular weights, percentages, temperatures, times, and so forth, as used in the specification or claims are to be understood as being modified by the term ‚Äúabout.‚Äù Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, implicitly or explicitly, the numerical parameters set forth are approximations that may depend on the desired properties sought and/or limits of detection under standard test conditions/methods. When directly and explicitly distinguishing embodiments from discussed prior art, the embodiment numbers are not approximates unless the word ‚Äúabout‚Äù is expressly recited.
Unless explained otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure pertains. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described below. The materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only and not intended to be limiting.
When chemical structures are depicted or described, unless explicitly stated otherwise, all carbons are assumed to include hydrogen so that each carbon conforms to a valence of four. For example, in the structure on the left-hand side of the schematic below there are nine hydrogen atoms implied. The nine hydrogen atoms are depicted in the right-hand structure.
<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-C00011.TIF </img>
Sometimes a particular atom in a structure is described in textual formula as having a hydrogen or hydrogen atoms, for example -CH2CH2-. It will be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned descriptive techniques are common in the chemical arts to provide brevity and simplicity to description of organic structures.
If a group R is depicted as ‚Äúfloating‚Äù on a ring system, as for example in the group:
<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-C00012.TIF </img>
then, unless otherwise defined, a substituent R can reside on any atom of the fused bicyclic ring system, excluding the atom carrying the bond with the ‚Äú<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-P00001.TIF </img>‚Äù symbol so long as a stable structure is formed. In the example depicted, the R group can reside on an atom in either the 5-membered or the 6-membered ring of the indolyl ring system.‚Äù symbol so long as a stable structure is formed. In the example depicted, the R group can reside on an atom in either the 5-membered or the 6-membered ring of the indolyl ring system.
When there are more than one such depicted ‚Äúfloating‚Äù groups, as for example in the formulae:
<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-C00013.TIF </img>
where there are two groups, namely, the R and the bond indicating attachment to a parent structure; then, unless otherwise defined, the ‚Äúfloating‚Äù groups can reside on any atoms of the ring system, again assuming each replaces a depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen on the ring system and a chemically stable compound would be formed by such an arrangement.
When a group R is depicted as existing on a ring system containing saturated carbons, as for example in the formula:
<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-C00014.TIF </img>
where, in this example, y can be more than one, assuming each replaces a currently depicted, implied, or expressly defined hydrogen on the ring; then, unless otherwise defined, two R's can reside on the same carbon. A simple example is when R is a methyl group. The depicted structure can exist as a geminal dimethyl on a carbon of the depicted ring (an ‚Äúannular‚Äù carbon). In another example, two R's on the same carbon, including that same carbon, can form a ring, thus creating a spirocyclic ring (a ‚Äúspirocyclyl‚Äù group) structure. For example, shown below two Rs can form a piperidine ring in a spirocyclic arrangement with the cyclohexane, as
<img> id-US20180111917A1-20180426-C00015.TIF </img>
As used herein, the term ‚Äúsubstituted‚Äù refers to all subsequent modifiers in a term, for example in the term ‚Äúsubstituted arylC1-8alkyl,‚Äù substitution may occur on the ‚ÄúC1-8alkyl‚Äù portion, the ‚Äúaryl‚Äù portion or both portions of the arylC1-8alkyl group.
‚ÄúSubstituted,‚Äù when used to modify a specified group or moiety, means that at least one, and perhaps two or more, hydrogen atoms of the specified group or moiety is independently replaced with the same or different substituent groups as defined below. In a particular embodiment, a group, moiety or substituent may be substituted or unsubstituted, unless expressly defined as either ‚Äúunsubstituted‚Äù or ‚Äúsubstituted.‚Äù Accordingly, any of the groups specified herein may be unsubstituted or substituted. In particular embodiments, the substituent may or may not be expressly defined as substituted, but is still contemplated to be optionally substituted. For example, an ‚Äúalkyl‚Äù or a ‚Äúpyrazolyl‚Äù moiety may be unsubstituted or substituted, but an ‚Äúunsubstituted alkyl‚Äù or an ‚Äúunsubstituted pyrazolyl‚Äù is not substituted.
‚ÄúSubstituents‚Äù or ‚Äúsubstituent groups‚Äù for substituting for one or more hydrogen atoms on saturated carbon atoms in the specified group or moiety are, unless otherwise specified, -R60, halo, ‚ïêO, -OR70, -SR70, -N(R80)2, haloalkyl, perhaloalkyl, -CN, -NO2, ‚ïêN2, -N3, -SO2R70, -SO3‚àíM+, -SO3R70, -OSO2R70, -OSO3‚àíM+, -OSO3R70, -P(O)(O‚àí)2(M+)2, -P(O)(O‚àí)2M2+, -P(O)(OR70)O‚àíM+, -P(O)(OR70)2, -C(O)R70, -C(S)R70, -C(NR70)R70, -CO2‚àíM+, -CO2R70, -C(S)OR70, -C(O)N(R80)2, -C(NR70)(R80)2, -OC(O)R70, -OC(S)R70, -OCO2‚àíM+, -OCO2R70, -OC(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)R70, -NR70C(S)R70, -NR70CO2‚àíM+, -NR70CO2R70, -NR70C(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)N(R80)2, -NR70C(NR70)R70 and -NR70C(NR70)N(R80)2, where R60 is C1-10aliphatic, heteroaliphatic, or cycloaliphatic, typically, C1-6aliphatic, more typically C1-6alkyl, where R60 optionally may be substituted; each R70 is independently for each occurrence hydrogen or R60; each R80 is independently for each occurrence R70 or alternatively, two R80 groups, taken together with the nitrogen atom to which they are bonded, form a 3- to 7-membered heterocycloaliphatic, which optionally includes from 1 to 4 of the same or different additional heteroatoms selected from O, N and S, of which N optionally has R70 substitution, such as H or C1-C3alkyl substitution; and each M+ is a counter ion with a net single positive charge. Each M+ is independently for each occurrence, for example, an alkali metal ion, such as K+, Na+, Li+; an ammonium ion, such as +N(R60)4; a protonated amino acid ion, such as a lysine ion, or an arginine ion; or an alkaline metal earth ion, such as [Ca2+]0.5, [Mg2+]0.5, or [Ba2+]0.5 (a subscript ‚Äú0.5‚Äù means, for example, that one of the counter ions for such divalent alkali earth ions can be an ionized form of a compound of the invention and the other a typical counter ion such as chloride, or two ionized compounds can serve as counter ions for such divalent alkali earth ions, or a doubly ionized compound can serve as the counter ion for such divalent alkali earth ions). As specific examples, -N(R80)2 includes -NH2, -NH-alkyl, -NH-pyrrolidin-3-yl, N-pyrrolidinyl, N-piperazinyl, 4N-methyl-piperazin-1-yl, N-morpholinyl and the like. Any two hydrogen atoms on a single carbon also can be replaced with, for example, ‚ïêO, ‚ïêNR70, ‚ïêN-OR70, ‚ïêN2 or ‚ïêS.
Substituent groups for replacing hydrogen atoms on unsaturated carbon atoms in groups containing unsaturated carbons are, unless otherwise specified, -R60, halo, -O‚àíM+, -OR70, -SR70, -S‚àíM+, -N(R80)2, haloalkyl, perhaloalkyl, -CN, -OCN, -SCN, -NO, -NO2, -N3, -SO2R70, -SO3‚àíM+, -SO3R70, -OSO2R70, -OSO3‚àíM+, -OSO3R70, -PO3‚àí2(M+)2, -PO3‚àí2M2+, -P(O)(OR70)O‚àíM+, -P(O)(OR70)2, -C(O)R70, -C(S)R70, -C(NR70)R70, -CO2‚àíM+, -CO2R70, -C(S)OR70, -C(O)NR80R80, -C(NR70)N(R80)2, -OC(O)R70, -OC(S)R70, -OCO2‚àíM+, -OCO2R70, -OC(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)R70, -NR70C(S)R70, -NR70CO2‚àíM+, -NR70CO2R70, -NR70C(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)N(R80)2, -NR70C(NR70)R70 and -NR70C(NR70)N(R80)2, where R60, R70, R80 and M+ are as previously defined, provided that in case of substituted alkene or alkyne, the substituents are not -O‚àíM+, -OR70, -SR70, or -S‚àíM+.
Substituent groups for replacing hydrogen atoms on nitrogen atoms in groups containing such nitrogen atoms are, unless otherwise specified, -R60, -O‚àíM+, -OR70, -SR70, -S‚àíM+, -N(R80)2, haloalkyl, perhaloalkyl, -CN, -NO, -NO2, -S(O)2R70, -SO3‚àíM+, -SO3R70, -OS(O)2R70, -OSO3‚àíM+, -OSO3R70, -PO3‚àí2 (M+)2, -PO3‚àí2 M2+, -P(O)(OR70)O‚àíM+, -P(O)(OR70)(OR70), -C(O)R70, -C(S)R70, -C(NR70)R70, -CO2R70, -C(S)OR70, -C(O)NR80R80, -C(NR70)NR80R80, -OC(O)R70, -OC(S)R70, -OCO2R70, -OC(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)R70, -NR70C(S)R70, -NR70CO2R70, -NR70C(S)OR70, -NR70C(O)N(R80)2, -NR70C(NR70)R70 and -NR70C(NR70)N(R80)2, where R60, R70, R80 and M+ are as previously defined.
In one embodiment, a group that is substituted has at least one substituent up to the number of substituents possible for a particular moiety, such as 1 substituent, 2 substituents, 3 substituents, or 4 substituents.
Additionally, in embodiments where a group or moiety is substituted with a substituted substituent, the nesting of such substituted substituents is limited to three, thereby preventing the formation of polymers. Thus, in a group or moiety comprising a first group that is a substituent on a second group that is itself a substituent on a third group, which is attached to the parent structure, the first (outermost) group can only be substituted with unsubstituted substituents. For example, in a group comprising -(aryl-1)-(aryl-2)-(aryl-3), aryl-3 can only be substituted with substituents that are not themselves substituted.
Any group or moiety defined herein can be connected to any other portion of a disclosed structure, such as a parent or core structure, as would be understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art, such as by considering valence rules, comparison to exemplary species, and/or considering functionality, unless the connectivity of the group or moiety to the other portion of the structure is expressly stated, or is implied by context.

Specific examples include, -C(O)H, -C(O)Me, -C(O)Et, or -C(O)cyclopropyl.
‚ÄúAliphatic‚Äù refers to a substantially hydrocarbon-based group or moiety. An aliphatic group or moiety can be acyclic, including alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl groups, cyclic versions thereof, such as cycloaliphatic groups or moieties including cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl or cycloalkynyl, and further including straight- and branched-chain arrangements, and all stereo and position isomers as well. Unless expressly stated otherwise, an aliphatic group contains from one to twenty-five carbon atoms (C1-25); for example, from one to fifteen (C1-15), from one to ten (C1-10), from one to six (C1-6), or from one to four carbon atoms (C1-4) for an acyclic aliphatic group or moiety, or from three to fifteen (C3-15) from three to ten (C3-10), from three to six (C3-6), or from three to four (C3-4) carbon atoms for a cycloaliphatic group or moiety. An aliphatic group may be substituted or unsubstituted, unless expressly referred to as an ‚Äúunsubstituted aliphatic‚Äù or a ‚Äúsubstituted aliphatic.‚Äù An aliphatic group can be substituted with one or more substituents (up to two substituents for each methylene carbon in an aliphatic chain, or up to one substituent for each carbon of a -C‚ïêC- double bond in an aliphatic chain, or up to one substituent for a carbon of a terminal methine group).

(iv) stabilizing the disease or condition.
As used herein, the terms ‚Äúdisease‚Äù and ‚Äúcondition‚Äù can be used interchangeably or can be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been determined) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, where a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.
The above definitions and the following general formulas are not intended to include impermissible substitution patterns (e.g., methyl substituted with 5 fluoro groups). Such impermissible substitution patterns are easily recognized by a person having ordinary skill in the art.
Any of the groups referred to herein may be optionally substituted by at least one, possibly two or more, substituents as defined herein. That is, a substituted group has at least one, possible two or more, substitutable hydrogens replaced by a substituent or substituents as defined herein, unless the context indicates otherwise or a particular structural formula precludes substitution.
A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that compounds may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism, conformational isomerism, geometric isomerism, and/or optical isomerism. For example, certain disclosed compounds can include one or more chiral centers and/or double bonds and as a consequence can exist as stereoisomers, such as double-bond isomers (i.e., geometric isomers), enantiomers, diasteromers, and mixtures thereof, such as racemic mixtures. As another example, certain disclosed compounds can exist in several tautomeric forms, including the enol form, the keto form, and mixtures thereof. As the various compound names, formulae and compound drawings within the specification and claims can represent only one of the possible tautomeric, conformational isomeric, optical isomeric, or geometric isomeric forms, a person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the disclosed compounds encompass any tautomeric, conformational isomeric, optical isomeric, and/or geometric isomeric forms of the compounds described herein, as well as mixtures of these various different isomeric forms. In cases of limited rotation, e.g. around the amide bond or between two directly attached rings such as the pyrazolyl and pyridinyl rings, atropisomers are also possible and are also specifically included in the compounds of the invention.
In any embodiments, any or all hydrogens present in the compound, or in a particular group or moiety within the compound, may be replaced by a deuterium or a tritium. Thus, a recitation of alkyl includes deuterated alkyl, where from one to the maximum number of hydrogens present may be replaced by deuterium. For example, ethyl may be C2H5 or C2H5 where from 1 to 5 hydrogens are replaced by deuterium, such as in C2DxH5-x.

Compound 10 is nitrated using a suitable nitrating reagent or mixture of reagents 12 to form compound 14. Suitable nitrating conditions include reacting compound 10 with nitric acid, such as fuming nitric acid, optionally in the presence of sulfuric acid. Typically, compound 10 and the nitric acid are added slowly, one to the other. Cooling, such as by using an ice bath, may be used to maintain the reaction temperature within a suitable range, such as from about 0¬∞ C. to less than 50¬∞ C., from 0¬∞ C. to 20¬∞ C., or from 0 OC to 10¬∞ C. After the addition is complete the reaction is allowed to proceed until the reaction is substantially complete, and may be allowed to warm to room temperature to facilitate the reaction. Optionally, additional nitrating reagent, or mixture of nitrating reagents, may be added to facilitate the reaction proceeding to completion. The reaction is then quenched, such as by addition to water and/or ice, and the product is separated or extracted from the aqueous and purified if required. Purification techniques suitable for purifying a product from any reaction disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, crystallization, distillation and/or chromatography.
With continued reference to Scheme 2, compound 14 is then reacted with compound 16 to form compound 18. Compound 16 comprises a desired R1 moiety and a suitable leaving group, LG. Suitable leaving groups include any group that will act as a leaving group to facilitate the addition of the R1 moiety to compound 14. Suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogens, typically bromo, chloro or iodo, and tosylate or mesylate groups. Compound 14 is reacted with compound 16 in a suitable solvent and typically in the presence of a base. Suitable solvents include any solvent that facilitates the reaction, such as aprotic solvents. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, DMF (dimethylformamide), THF (tetrahydrofuran), DMSO (dimethylsulfoxide), acetonitrile, chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform, DMA (dimethylacetamide), dioxane, N-methyl pyrrolidone, or combinations thereof. Suitable bases include any base that will facilitate the reactions, such as a hydride, typically sodium hydride, or a carbonate, such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, or cesium carbonate. The reaction may proceed at room temperature, or the reaction mixture may be heated, such as to 50¬∞ C., 100¬∞ C. or higher, as required. Compound 18 is then isolated from the reaction mixture and purified if required.
Compound 18 is then reacted with a reducing agent 20 suitable to reduce the nitro moiety to an amine. Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to: hydrogen gas in the presence of a catalyst, such as a palladium catalyst; a borohydride, such as sodium borohydride, optionally in the presence of a catalyst, such as a nickel catalyst; zinc metal in acetic acid; or iron powder in water or water and acid. In certain embodiments, hydrogen gas is used in combination with a palladium on carbon catalyst, and in a suitable solvent, such as ethyl acetate or methanol. In some embodiments, a combination of reducing agents and/or techniques are used. For example, reduction may be initially performed using a first method comprising a first reducing agent and/or technique, but result in a mixture of products. The first method may be repeated, and/or a second method may be performed, comprising a second reducing agent and/or technique. Once the reaction is complete, as indicated by an analytical technique such as LC-MS, TLC or HPLC, the product compound 22 is isolated and purified if necessary.
A 3rd step of the exemplary reaction sequence is provided below according to Scheme 3.

Compound 22 is reacted with a carboxylic acid 24 to form amide 26. The carboxylic acid 24 may be activated by any suitable method and then reacted with amine 22. Suitable activation methods include, but are not limited to: forming the acid chloride, such as by treatment with thionyl chloride; treatment with 1-[Bis(dimethylamino)methylene]-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridinium 3-oxid hexafluorophosphate (HATU) and a base such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA); treatment with carbonyldiimidazole (CDI); or treatment with a carbodiimide, such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC).
Amide 26 is then coupled with compound 28 to form compound 30 using any coupling reaction suitable to form a bond between two rings. In the example of Scheme 3, a boronic acid coupling is shown using boronic acid 28, where the leaving group LG on compound 26 is typically bromo or iodo. Other suitable coupling functional groups include trialkyl tin or boronic esters. The coupling reaction typically proceeds in the presence of a suitable catalyst. For a boronic acid coupling, the catalyst typically is a palladium catalyst, such as PdCl2(dppf)2, Pd[P(Ph)3]2Cl2, palladium acetate and triphenyl phosphine, or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). The reaction is performed in the presence of a base, such as sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate, and is performed in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, such as dioxane, dioxane/water or DME (dimethoyethane)/ethanol/water. The reaction may be heated at a suitable temperature, such as to a temperature within the range of greater than room temperature up to the boiling point of the selected solvent, such as at a temperature of 50¬∞ C. to 125¬∞ C., typically about 100¬∞ C., and/or agitated for a suitable period of time, such as from 1 hour to 3 days, from 6 hours to 24 hours, or from 12 hours to 18 hours, to facilitate the reaction proceeding to completion. Compound 30 is then isolated from the reaction mixture and purified by a suitable technique.
An alternative exemplary synthesis may include the following 1st reaction step according to Scheme 4.

Compound 32 is nitrated using a suitable nitrating reagent or mixture of reagents 34 to form compound 36. Suitable nitrating conditions include reacting compound 32 with nitric acid, such as fuming nitric acid, optionally in the presence of sulfuric acid. Typically, compound 32 and the nitric acid are added slowly, one to the other. Cooling, such as by using an ice bath, may be used to maintain the reaction temperature within a suitable range, such as from about 0¬∞ C. to less than 50¬∞ C., from 0¬∞ C. to 20¬∞ C., or from 0 OC to 10¬∞ C. After the addition is complete the reaction is allowed to proceed until the reaction is substantially complete, and may be allowed to warm to room temperature to facilitate the reaction. Optionally, additional nitrating reagent, or mixture of nitrating reagents, may be added to facilitate the reaction proceeding to completion. The reaction is then quenched, such as by addition to water and/or ice, and the product is separated or extracted from an aqueous phase and purified if required. Purification techniques suitable for purifying a product from any reaction disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, crystallization, distillation and/or chromatography.
With continued reference to Scheme 4, compound 36 is then reacted with compound 38 to form compound 40.

Suitable leaving groups include any group that will act as a leaving group to facilitate the addition of the ring to compound 36. Suitable leaving groups include, but are not limited to, halogens, typically bromo, chloro or iodo, and tosylate or mesylate groups. Compound 36 is reacted with compound 38 in a suitable solvent and typically in the presence of a base. Suitable solvents include any solvent that facilitates the reaction, such as aprotic solvents. Suitable solvents include, but are not limited to, DMF, THF, DMSO, acetonitrile, chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane and chloroform, DMA, dioxane, N-methyl pyrrolidone, or combinations thereof.
Suitable bases include any base that will facilitate the reaction, such as a hydride, typically sodium hydride, or a carbonate, such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, or cesium carbonate. The reaction may proceed at room temperature, or the reaction mixture may be heated, such as to a temperature within the range of greater than room temperature up to the boiling point of the selected solvent, such as at 50¬∞ C., 100¬∞ C. or higher, as required. Compound 40 is then isolated from the reaction mixture and purified if required.
Compound 40 is then reacted with a reducing agent 42 suitable to reduce the carbonyl moiety to a hydroxyl group. Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to, sodium borohydride, di-isobutyl aluminum hydride, or lithium aluminum hydride. The reaction is performed in a solvent suitable to facilitate the reaction, such as an alcohol, particularly methanol or ethanol, THF, or diethyl ether.

Examples of allergic disorders that may be treated using the amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, include, but are not limited to, asthma (e.g. atopic asthma, allergic asthma, atopic bronchial IgE-mediated asthma, non-atopic asthma, bronchial asthma, non-allergic asthma, essential asthma, true asthma, intrinsic asthma caused by pathophysiologic disturbances, essential asthma of unknown or unapparent cause, emphysematous asthma, exercise-induced asthma, emotion-induced asthma, extrinsic asthma caused by environmental factors, cold air induced asthma, occupational asthma, infective asthma caused by or associated with bacterial, fungal, protozoal, or viral infection, incipient asthma, wheezy infant syndrome, bronchiolitis, cough variant asthma or drug-induced asthma), allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, perennial rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, post-nasal drip, purulent or non-purulent sinusitis, acute or chronic sinusitis, and ethmoid, frontal, maxillary, or sphenoid sinusitis.
As another example, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically results in swelling, pain, loss of motion and tenderness of target joints throughout the body. RA is characterized by chronically inflamed synovium that is densely crowded with lymphocytes. The synovial membrane, which is typically one cell layer thick, becomes intensely cellular and assumes a form similar to lymphoid tissue, including dendritic cells, T-, B- and NK cells, macrophages and clusters of plasma cells. This process, as well as a plethora of immunopathological mechanisms including the formation of antigen-immunoglobulin complexes, eventually result in destruction of the integrity of the joint, resulting in deformity, permanent loss of function and/or bone erosion at or near the joint. The amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, may be used to treat, ameliorate or prevent any one, several or all of these symptoms of RA. Thus, in the context of RA, the compounds are considered to provide therapeutic benefit when a reduction or amelioration of any of the symptoms commonly associated with RA is achieved, regardless of whether the treatment results in a concomitant treatment of the underlying RA and/or a reduction in the amount of circulating rheumatoid factor (‚ÄúRF‚Äù).
The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has developed criteria for defining improvement and clinical remission in RA. Once such parameter, the ACR20 (ACR criteria for 20% clinical improvement), requires a 20% improvement in the tender and swollen joint count, as well as a 20% improvement in 3 of the following 5 parameters: patient's global assessment, physician's global assessment, patient's assessment of pain, degree of disability, and level of acute phase reactant. These criteria have been expanded for 50% and 70% improvement in ACR50 and ACR70, respectively. Other criteria include Paulu's criteria and radiographic progression (e.g. Sharp score).
In some embodiments, therapeutic benefit in patients suffering from RA is achieved when the patient exhibits an ACR20. In specific embodiments, ACR improvements of ACRC50 or even ACR70 may be achieved.
B. Formulations and Administration

The formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, and may contain added preservatives.
Alternatively, the injectable formulation may be provided in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, including but not limited to sterile, pyrogen-free water, buffer, dextrose solution, etc., before use. To this end, the active compound(s) maybe dried by any art-known technique, such as lyophilization, and reconstituted prior to use.
For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are known in the art.
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, lozenges, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, such as: binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium hydrogen phosphate); lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); and/or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate). The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art with, for example, sugars, films or enteric coatings.
Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, elixirs, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as: suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, Cremophore‚Ñ¢ or fractionated vegetable oils); and preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The preparations may also contain buffer salts, preservatives, flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents as appropriate.
Preparations for oral administration may be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the active compound or prodrug, as is well known.
For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.
For rectal and vaginal routes of administration, the active compound(s) may be formulated as solutions (for retention enemas) suppositories or ointments containing conventional suppository bases, such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.
For nasal administration or administration by inhalation or insufflation, the active compound(s), hydrate, solvate, N-oxide, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug(s) can be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from pressurized packs or a nebulizer with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g.,) dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, fluorocarbons, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator (for example capsules and cartridges comprised of gelatin) may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.
A specific example of an aqueous suspension formulation suitable for nasal administration using commercially-available nasal spray devices includes the following ingredients: active compound or prodrug (0.5 20 mg/ml); benzalkonium chloride (0.1 0.2 mg/mL); polysorbate 80 (TWEEN¬Æ 80; 0.5 5 mg/ml); carboxymethylcellulose sodium or microcrystalline cellulose (1 15 mg/ml); phenylethanol (1 4 mg/ml); and dextrose (20 50 mg/ml). The pH of the final suspension can be adjusted to range from about pH 5 to pH 7, with a pH of about pH 5.5 being typical.
Another specific example of an aqueous suspension suitable for administration of the compounds via inhalation contains 20 mg/mL of the amide compound(s) or prodrug(s), 1% (v/v) polysorbate 80 (TWEEN¬Æ 80), 50 mM citrate and/or 0.9% sodium chloride.
For ocular administration, the active amide compound(s) or prodrug(s) may be formulated as a solution, emulsion, suspension, etc. suitable for administration to the eye. A variety of vehicles suitable for administering compounds to the eye are known in the art. Specific non-limiting examples are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,261,547; 6,197,934; 6,056,950; 5,800,807; 5,776,445; 5,698,219; 5,521,222; 5,403,841; 5,077,033; 4,882,150; and 4,738,851, which are incorporated herein by reference.
For prolonged delivery, the active amide compound(s) or prodrug(s) can be formulated as a depot preparation for administration by implantation or intramuscular injection. The active ingredient maybe formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (e.g., as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, e.g., as a sparingly soluble salt. Alternatively, transdermal delivery systems manufactured as an adhesive disc or patch which slowly releases the active compound(s) for percutaneous absorption may be used. To this end, permeation enhancers may be used to facilitate transdermal penetration of the active compound(s). Suitable transdermal patches are described in for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,407,713; 5,352,456; 5,332,213; 5,336,168; 5,290,561; 5,254,346; 5,164,189; 5,163,899; 5,088,977; 5,087,240; 5,008,110; and 4,921,475, which are incorporated herein by reference.
Alternatively, other pharmaceutical delivery systems may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well-known examples of delivery vehicles that may be used to deliver active compound(s) or prodrug(s). Certain organic solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), may also be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity.
The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound(s). The pack may, for example, comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration.
C. Dosages
The amide compound or combinations of amide compounds will generally be used in an amount effective to achieve the intended result, for example, in an amount effective to treat, prevent or ameliorate a particular condition. The amide compound(s), or compositions thereof, can be administered therapeutically to achieve therapeutic benefit or prophylactically to achieve a prophylactic benefit. Therapeutic benefit means eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated and/or eradication or amelioration of one or more of the symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that the patient reports an improvement in feeling or condition, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For example, administration of a compound to a patient suffering from an allergy provides therapeutic benefit not only when the underlying allergic response is eradicated or ameliorated, but also when the patient reports a decrease in the severity or duration of the symptoms associated with the allergy following exposure to the allergen. As another example, therapeutic benefit in the context of asthma includes an improvement in respiration following the onset of an asthmatic attack or a reduction in the frequency or severity of asthmatic episodes. Therapeutic benefit also includes halting or slowing the progression of the disease, regardless of whether improvement is realized.
As known by those of ordinary skill in the art, the preferred dosage of amide compounds may depend on various factors, including the age, weight, general health, and severity of the condition of the patient or subject being treated. Dosage also may need to be tailored to the sex of the individual and/or the lung capacity of the individual, when administered by inhalation. Dosage may also be tailored to individuals suffering from more than one condition or those individuals who have additional conditions that affect lung capacity and the ability to breathe normally, for example, emphysema, bronchitis, pneumonia, and respiratory infections. Dosage, and frequency of administration of the amide compound(s) or compositions thereof, will also depend on whether the amide compound(s) are formulated for treatment of acute episodes of a condition or for the prophylactic treatment of a disorder. A person or ordinary skill in the art will be able to determine the optimal dose for a particular individual.
For prophylactic administration, the amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, can be administered to a patient or subject at risk of developing one of the previously described conditions. For example, if it is unknown whether a patient or subject is allergic to a particular drug, the amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, can be administered prior to administration of the drug to avoid or ameliorate an allergic response to the drug. Alternatively, prophylactic administration can be used to avoid or ameliorate the onset of symptoms in a patient diagnosed with the underlying disorder. For example, an amide compound(s), or composition thereof, can be administered to an allergy sufferer prior to expected exposure to the allergen. An amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, can also be administered prophylactically to healthy individuals who are repeatedly exposed to agents known to one of the above-described maladies to prevent the onset of the disorder. For example, an amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, can be administered to a healthy individual who is repeatedly exposed to an allergen known to induce allergies, such as latex, in an effort to prevent the individual from developing an allergy. Alternatively, an amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, can be administered to a patient suffering from asthma prior to partaking in activities which trigger asthma attacks to lessen the severity of, or avoid altogether, an asthmatic episode.
Effective dosages can be estimated initially from in vitro assays. For example, an initial dosage for use in subjects can be formulated to achieve a circulating blood or serum concentration of active compound that is at or above an IC50 or EC50 of the particular compound as measured in an in vitro assay. Dosages can be calculated to achieve such circulating blood or serum concentrations taking into account the bioavailability of the particular compound. Fingl & Woodbury, ‚ÄúGeneral Principles,‚Äù In: Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmaceutical Basis of Therapeutics, Chapter 1, pages 1-46, Pergamon Press, and the references cited therein, provide additional guidance concerning effective dosages.
In some embodiments, the disclosed compounds have an EC50 from greater than 0 to 20 ŒºM, such as from greater than 0 to 10 ŒºM, from greater than 0 to 5 ŒºM, from greater than 0 to 1 ŒºM, from greater than 0 to 0.5 ŒºM, from greater than 0 to 0.1 ŒºM, or from greater than 0 to 0.05 ŒºM.
Initial dosages can also be estimated from in vivo data, such as animal models. Animal models useful for testing the efficacy of compounds to treat or prevent the various diseases described above are well-known in the art. Suitable animal models of hypersensitivity or allergic reactions are described in Foster, (1995) Allergy 50(21Suppl):6-9, discussion 34-38 and Tumas et al., (2001), J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 107(6):1025-1033. Suitable animal models of allergic rhinitis are described in Szelenyi et al., (2000), Arzneimittelforschung 50(11):1037-42; Kawaguchi et al., (1994), Clin. Exp. Allergy 24(3):238-244 and Sugimoto et al., (2000), Immunopharmacology 48(1):1-7. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can adapt such information to determine dosages suitable for human administration.
Dosage amounts of disclosed amide compounds will typically be in the range of from about greater than 0 mg/kg/day, such as 0.0001 mg/kg/day or 0.001 mg/kg/day or 0.01 mg/kg/day, up to at least about 100 mg/kg/day. More typically, the dosage (or effective amount) may range from about 0.0025 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg administered at least once per day, such as from 0.01 mg/kg to about 0.5 mg/kg or from about 0.05 mg/kg to about 0.15 mg/kg. The total daily dosage typically ranges from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg or to about 20 mg/kg per day, such as from 0.5 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg per day or from about 0.7 mg/kg per day to about 2.5 mg/kg/day. Dosage amounts can be higher or lower depending upon, among other factors, the activity of the amide compound, its bioavailability, the mode of administration, and various factors discussed above.
Dosage amount and dosage interval can be adjusted for individuals to provide plasma levels of the amide compound that are sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effect. For example, the compounds can be administered once per day, multiple times per day, once per week, multiple times per week (e.g., every other day), one per month, multiple times per month, or once per year, depending upon, amongst other things, the mode of administration, the specific indication being treated, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. Persons of ordinary skill in the art will be able to optimize effective local dosages without undue experimentation.
Compositions comprising one or more of the disclosed amide compounds typically comprise from greater than 0 up to 99% of the amide compound, or compounds, and/or other therapeutic agent by total weight percent. More typically, compositions comprising one or more of the disclosed amide compounds comprise from about 1 to about 20 total weight percent of the amide compound and other therapeutic agent, and from about 80 to about 99 weight percent of a pharmaceutically acceptable additive.
Preferably, the amide compound, combinations of amide compounds, or compositions thereof, will provide therapeutic or prophylactic benefit without causing substantial toxicity. Toxicity of the amide compound can be determined using standard pharmaceutical procedures. The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic (or prophylactic) effect is the therapeutic index. Amide compounds that exhibit high therapeutic indices are preferred.

On day 1, 50K/well THP-1 cells were seeded and primed with IFNŒ≥ (50 ng/mL) in 384-well plates for about 18 hours in RPMI media with 10% FBS. On day 2, the compound was serially diluted in DMSO from 5 mM in 3-fold dilutions, and then diluted 1:125 in RPMI media with 10% FBS. 50 ŒºL/well 2√ó compound was added to 50 ŒºL/well THP-1 cells (with IFNŒ≥ primed) in duplicate in 384 well tissue culture plates. The cells were pre-incubated with compound for 1 hour at 37¬∞ C., 5% CO2 before addition of 10 ŒºL/well 11√óLPS to give a final concentration of 1 ug/mL LPS. Day 3, after stimulation for 18 hours at 37¬∞ C., 5% CO2, the assay plate was centrifuged and 70 ŒºL/well supernatant was harvested. IL-23p19 protein in 70 ŒºL/well of supernatant was measured by sandwich ELISA, and 25 Œºl/well Cell Titer Glo reagent was added to the remaining cells to measure compound toxicity.
Human IL-23p19 Sandwich ELISA:
Maxisorp immuno ELISA plates were pre-coated with 25 ŒºL/well of anti-IL-23p19 capture antibody (2.5 ug/mL) in PBS overnight at room temperature. After washing with 1√óPBST, the plates were blocked using 100 ŒºL/well of 1% BSA in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. The plates were washed three times with 1√óPBST and 70 ŒºL/well supernatant were added. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with shaking and washed three times with 1√óPBST. 25 ŒºL/well of biotin labeled anti-IL-12(p40/p70) detection antibody (100 ng/mL) in PBS with 1% BSA was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with shaking. After washing three times with 1√óPBST, 25 ŒºL/well of streptavidin-HRP (1:200) in PBS with 1% BSA was added and the plates were incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes with shaking. The plates were washed three times with 1√óPBST and 25 ŒºL/well of Super Signal ELISA Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate were added. The plates were read with a luminometer, and the chemiluminescence values were entered into Athena (Rigel) for curve fitting, EC50 calculation, and database storage. The results are shown in Table 1.

Protocol
I. Differentiation of PBMC's to DC Cells:
Human PBMC cells (400 million) obtained from the vendor were transferred into a T-175 flask containing 15 ml RPMI media (10% FBS) and incubate for 2 hours at 37¬∞ C. After 2 hours, the media including floating cells was aspirated out carefully and 12 ml of fresh RPMI media (10% FBS) containing GMCSF (100 ng/ml) and IL4 (20 ng/ml) was added, and the flask was kept in a 37¬∞ C. incubator for 7 days.
After 3 days, fresh GMCSF (100 ng/ml) and IL4 (20 ng/ml) were added to the flask and the incubation continued. After 7 days, the fully differentiated cells were harvested by spinning down (1200 rpm/5 min) and aspirating the media. The cells were suspended in fresh RPMI media (10% FBS) containing 50 ng/ml IFNŒ≥ (1000 U/ml) and then plated (50K/well in 100 Œºl) onto a white clear bottom 96 well plate and left in a 37¬∞ C. incubator for 24 hours.
II. Addition of Compounds:
After 24 hours incubation, 100 Œºl of RPMI media was added containing 2√ó concentrated test compound per well to the above cell-culture media (final concentration becomes 1√ó) and the plates were pre-incubated for 1 hour at 37¬∞ C. before stimulating with LPS.
After 1 hour compound pre-incubation, 10 Œºl per well of 20√ó concentrated LPS solution in RPMI media was added to give a final concentration of 1 Œºg/ml. The mixture was shaken and incubated the plates at 37¬∞ C. for an additional 18 hours.
155 Œºl of the supernatant was harvested from each well carefully (without the tip touching the bottom of the well) and to the remaining 50 Œºl/well of the cell culture plate was added 50 Œºl of Cell Titer Glo reagent. The mixture was incubated for 1-2 minutes on a shaker and the plate was read for luminescence intensity to determine the compound cytotoxicity. The cell culture supernatant collected above was used to carry out IL23 ELISA (65 Œºl-Supernatant) and IL10 ELISA (90 Œºl-Supernatant) as described below.
