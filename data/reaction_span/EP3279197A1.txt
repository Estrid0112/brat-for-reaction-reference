Field of the invention
The present invention relates to radionuclide containing chemical compounds that exhibit activity at neurotensin receptors which can be used in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of a variety of conditions, and to precursors thereof which do not contain the radionuclide. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a method of preparation of chemical compounds having such activities and to the medical use of these compounds in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of a variety of conditions.
Background of the invention
Cancer represents one of the main causes of death worldwide. Mortality is particularly high among patients suffering from prostate, colorectal, pancreas, lung, bronchial and breast carcinoma. Although some progress has been made in the last few years, the development of more potent compounds for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of cancer remains a high priority and is required to tackle the growing number of deaths resulting from cancer.
Neurotensin receptors are transmembrane receptors that bind the neurotransmitter neurotensin. Among the three neurotensin receptor subtypes (NTS1-3), the G-protein coupled receptor NTS1 possesses the most suitable prerequisites to serve as a drug target (non-patent document 1). The NTS1 receptor is involved in a number of pathophysiological processes including neurodegenerative diseases such as schizophrenia (non-patent document 2) and Parkinson's disease (non-patent document 3). NTS1 overexpression has been demonstrated in various tumor types such as prostate, pancreas, colon and small cell lung carcinoma. The selective overexpression of NTS1 in tumors besides its apparently low expression in the corresponding healthy tissues thereby offers an outstanding opportunity to treat tumors by a targeted therapy approach. This is supported by various publications discussing NTS1 as a biomarker for the prognosis of different cancer types (non-patent document 4) and providing evidence for the overexpression of NTS1 in a number of cell types both in vitro and in vivo (non-patent documents 5 and 6).
The possibility to selectively address NTS1 overexpressing tumors in vivo has been also supported by several publications using radiolabeled agents for imaging of NTS1 receptors via positron emission tomography (PET) (exemplified by: non-patent documents 7 to 9). The treatment of small cell lung cancer with a small molecule NTS1 antagonist (Meclinertant, SR48692) failed due to a lack of efficacy, demonstrating that the therapy of tumors by blocking NTS1 receptors with an antagonist as the mechanism of action did not turn out to be successful. Nevertheless, SR48692 is able to sensitize tumors for radiotherapy (non-patent document 10).
A non-peptide 18F-labeled NTS1 tracer for PET imaging of NTS1 positive tumors has been described by the present inventors (non-patent document 11) and a non-peptide SPECT tracer labeled with In-111 has been described by Schulz et al. (non-patent document 12),
The presence of dopamine receptors in pancreatic tumors has been described (non-patent document 13). Therefore, radiotracers that bind to both dopamine receptors and NTS1 cannot be used for studying or staging NTS1-positive tumors adequately, because of the interfering signal from dopamine receptor binding.

Summary of the invention
The present invention relates to compounds of formula (I) comprising a non-peptide NTS1 antagonist and a chelator that is linked to the antagonist.
In view of the problems in the prior art, it was an object of the present invention to develop radiopharmaceuticals that show low binding to dopamine receptors and improved selectivity for NTS1. The present inventors developed new compounds which overcome these problems and show an improved selectivity for NTS1 receptors over dopamine receptors. This increased selectivity not only results in more potent activities but also enables the diagnosis and imaging of NTS1-positive tumors, e.g., by reducing the interference caused by dopamine receptor binding.
The present inventors have surprisingly found that the triazolyl moiety reduces the affinity of these compounds to dopamine receptors and leads to an increased tumor growth inhibition in vivo when compared to corresponding amide analogues.
Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention show subnanomolar affinity to NTS1, low affinity to dopamine receptors, selective concentration of the ligand in NTS1 overexpressing tumors, fast washout from healthy tissue and high uptake into tumors thus leading to a high dose of deposited radioactivity in the tumor with concomitant acceptable doses in healthy tissues.
Brief description of drawings
Fig. 1 shows the accumulation of radioactivity in NTS1 receptor-positive tumors (HT29, PC3, AsPC1) which was high at 24 and 48 h p.i. with excellent tumor retention over time, whereas the uptake in non-targeted tissue (e.g., blood, liver and bones) was significantly lower and showed a fast clearance rate.Fig. 2 shows results of the therapy study using PC3-xenografted nude mice injected either with 177Lu-14 (group B) or with saline (control, group A). Left: Progression of tumor size (tumor diameter) normalized to the day at begin of therapy. Right: Survival curves of 177Lu-14-treated animals in comparison with untreated control animals.
Definitions
As used herein, the term "alkyl" refers to a monovalent saturated acyclic (i.e., non-cyclic) hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched. Accordingly, an "alkyl" group does not comprise any carbon-to-carbon double bond or any carbon-to-carbon triple bond. A "C1-6 alkyl" denotes an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. Preferred exemplary alkyl groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl (e.g., n-propyl or isopropyl), or butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, or tert-butyl).
As used herein, the term "alkylene" refers to an alkanediyl group, i.e. a divalent saturated acyclic hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched. A "C1-3 alkylene" denotes an alkylene group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. Preferred exemplary alkylene groups are methylene (-CH2-), ethylene (e.g., -CH2-CH2- or -CH(-CH3)-) or propylene (e.g., -CH2-CH2-CH2-, -CH(-CH2-CH3)-, -CH2-CH(-CH3)-, or-CH(-CH3)-CH2-).
As used herein, the term "cycloalkyl" refers to a saturated hydrocarbon ring group, including monocyclic rings as well as bridged ring, spiro ring and/or fused ring systems (which may be composed, e.g., of two or three rings; such as, e.g., a fused ring system composed of two or three fused rings). "Cycloalkyl" may, e.g., refer to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, or adamantyl.
"Halogen" represents F, Cl, Br and I, more preferably F or Cl, even more preferably F.
The term "heteroarylene" refers to a divalent five or six-membered aromatic ring, wherein one or more of the carbon atoms in the ring have been replaced by 1, 2 or 3 of the same or different heteroatoms selected from N, O and S.

Detailed description of the invention
The present invention relates to a compound of formula (I), optionally in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, ester, polymorph, tautomer, racemate, enantiomer, diastereomer or mixture thereof<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>
In the compound of formula (I), R1 is selected from the group consisting of -hydrogen, -(C1-6 alkyl), -(C3-6 cycloalkyl) and -(C1-3 alkylene-C3-6 cycloalkyl), wherein C1-6 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl and the C1-3 alkylene and C3-6 cycloalkyl in (C1-3 alkylene-C3-6 cycloalkyl) may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms. R1 is preferably -(C1-3 alkyl) or -CH2-cyclopropyl. R1 is more preferably -(C1-3 alkyl).
R2 is selected from -hydrogen, -halogen, nitro, -(C1-6 alkyl), -(C3-6 cycloalkyl) and -(C1-3 alkylene-C3-6 cycloalkyl), wherein C1-6 alkyl, C3-6 cycloalkyl and the C1-3 alkylene and C3-6 cycloalkyl in (C1-3 alkylene-C3-6 cycloalkyl) may be substituted with one or more halogen atoms. R2 is preferably -halogen, nitro or -(C1-6 alkyl), wherein the C1-6 alkyl is optionally substituted with one or more fluorine. R2 is more preferably -(C1-6 alkyl).
R3 is selected from 2-amino-2-adamantane carboxylic acid, cyclohexylglycine and 9-amino-bicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-9-carboxylic acid. R3 is preferably a group having the following formula<img> id-imgb0002.tif </img>
The group Z
Z may be any group which comprises a chelator. It is preferred that Z in formula (I) does not comprise a radionuclide as defined in the present invention, unless otherwise specified.
Z preferably comprises a linker group and a chelator group. More preferably, Z is -(linker group)-(chelator group). The linker group and the chelator group are preferably as defined below.
The group Z may also comprise one or two or three groups of the following partial structure:<img> id-imgb0003.tif </img>
In these partial structures, the definitions of R1, R2 and R3 are independently as defined above with respect to formula (I). If group Z comprises such partial structures, the compound of formula (I) forms a multimeric structure which is expected to show enhanced avidity to the neurotensin receptor, probably due to the accumulated strength of multiple affinities of more than one non-covalent binding interaction with the receptor. The most important beneficial effects of such a multimeric structure could be improved tumor uptake in vivo, and also significantly improved tumor retention, and thereby improved imaging and therapy properties in comparison with monomers.
The linker group
Linker groups, which are commonly also referred to as spacers, are groups which separate two parts of a molecule. In the present invention, the linker group forms covalent bonds with both the chelator group and the part of the structure of formula (I) which is different from Z. The linker group may, in principle, be any chemical group which is capable of forming bonds with both the chelator group and the part of the structure of formula (I) which is different from Z. It is preferred that the linker group does not itself bind to a neurotensin receptor. Preferably, the linker group contains only atoms selected from H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br and I, which are preferably different from the radionuclides defined herein.
Examples of linker groups which can be used in the present invention contain one or more groups selected from -N(R4)-, -C1-10 alkylene-, -C(O)-, -O-, -heteroarylene-, -phenylene-, -S-, -S(O)- and -S(O)2-,wherein each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen and C1-6 alkyl,each C1-10 alkylene is independently optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen, C(O)OH and OH,each heteroarylene is independently 4 to 6 membered heteroarylene comprising 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S and the heteroarylene is optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen and C1-6 alkyl, andeach phenylene is optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen and C1-6 alkyl.
Furthermore, the linker group may comprise one or two or three side chains which can be attached to the main chain of the linker group by replacing one or two or three hydrogen residues, preferably in a -C1-10 alkylene- moiety, in the main chain of the linker group by the side chain(s). These side chains may comprise 1 to 10, preferably 1 to 8, groups selected from -N(R4)-, -C1-10 alkylene-, -C(O)-, -O-, -heteroarylene-, -phenylene-, -S-, -S(O)- and -S(O)2- and are terminated by -H, wherein the definitions of R4 and the optional substituents of the other groups are as defined for the main chain of the linker group.
The linker group preferably consists of one or more groups selected from -N(R4)-, -C1-10 alkylene-, -C(O)-, -O-, -heteroarylene-, -phenylene-, -S-, -S(O)- and -S(O)2-.
In the present invention, it is preferred that the linker group comprises or consists of 3 to 15, more preferably 3 to 12, even more preferably 3 to 10 and most preferably 4 to 8 of the above groups.
Furthermore, as will be apparent to a skilled person, two adjacent groups in the linker group should be chosen so as to avoid a direct bond between two groups which would result in a partial structure which is not stable, in particular, in an aqueous medium at 25°C and a pressure of 1 atm. From this standpoint, combinations such as -N(R4)-N(R4)-, -C(O)-C(O)-, -O-O-, -S-S-, -S(O)-S(O)-, -S(O)2-S(O)2-, -N(R4)-O-, -O-N(R4)-, -N(R4)-S-, -S-N(R4)-, -N(R4)-S(O)-, -S(O)-N(R4)-, -C(O)-S-, -S-C(O)-, -C(O)-S(O)-, -S(O)-C(O)-, -C(O)-S(O)2-, -S(O)2-C(O)-, -S-O-, -O-S-, -S(O)-O-, -O-S(O)-, -S(O)-S-, -S-S(O)-, -S(O)2-S-, -S-S(O)2-, S(O)2-S(O)- and -S(O)-S(O)2- are preferably excluded.
Furthermore, it is preferred that the combinations -C1-10 alkylene-C1-10 alkylene-, -heteroarylene-heteroarylene- and -phenylene-phenylene- are excluded.
An example of a side chain of the linker group, which is of particular interest in the present invention, is the following:<img> id-imgb0004.tif </img>
This group has been found to bind well to albumin and can be used to increase plasma half life and bioavailability of certain compounds (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2008, 47(17) 3196 - 3201).
A more preferred class of linker groups is represented by -(X)p-, wherein p is an integer from 1 to 10. Preferably, p is an integer from 1 to 8, 1 to 6, 1 to 5, 1 to 4 or 1 to 3.
Each X is preferably independently selected from(a) -(N(R4)-C1-10 alkylene)-,(b) -(N(R4)-heteroarylene)-,(c) -(N(R4)-C(O))-,(d) -(O-C1-10 alkylene)-,(e) -(O-heteroarylene)-,(f) -(O-C(O))-,(g) -(C1-10 alkylene-heteroarylene)-,(h) -(C1-10 alkylene-C(O))-,(i) -(C(O)-C1-10 alkylene)-,(j) -(C(O)-heteroarylene)-,(k) -(heteroarylene-C1-10 alkylene)-,(l) -(heteroarylene-C(O))-, and(m) -(C1-10 alkylene)-.
In each X, C1-10 alkylene is independently optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen, C(O)OH and OH.
In each X, heteroarylene is 4 to 6-membered heteroarylene comprising 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S and the heteroarylene is optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen and C1-6 alkyl.
Each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen and C1-6 alkyl.
Especially preferred linker groups are selected from(i) -C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-C(O)-C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-,(ii) -C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-C1-10 alkylene-heteroarylene-C1-10 alkylene-C(O)-C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-, and(iii) -C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-C1-10 alkylene-N(R4)-.
In these preferred examples, each C1-10 alkylene is independently optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen, C(O)OH and OH. The heteroarylene is 4 to 6-membered heteroarylene comprising 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from N, O and S and the heteroarylene is optionally substituted with one or more selected from halogen and C1-6 alkyl. Each R4 is independently selected from hydrogen and C1-6 alkyl. Preferably, each R4 is independently selected from H, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl and iso-propyl.
The chelator group
The chelator group is a group capable of binding with and/or complexing a metal ion to form a heterocyclic ring including the metal ion. The metal ion includes metal ions which are defined as the radionuclides. Preferably, the chelator group contains only atoms selected from H, B, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br and I, which are preferably different from the radionuclides defined herein.
Such chelators are known to the person skilled in the art. A wide variety of respective chelators is available and has been summarized by Banerjee et al. (Banerjee et al., Nucl. Med. Biol., 2005, 32, 1-20, and references therein, Wadas et al., Chem. Rev., 2010, 110, 2858-2902 and references therein). Such chelators include, but are not limited to linear, macrocyclic, tetrapyridine, N3S, N2S2 and N4 chelators as disclosed in US 5,367,080 A, US 5,364,613 A, US 5,021,556 A, US 5,075,099 A and US 5,886,142 A.
Further examples of suitable chelators are disclosed in US 5,720,934 and by Doulias et al. (Doulias et al., Free Radio. Biol. Med., 2003, 35, 719-728).
The diagnostic and/or therapeutic use of some of the above chelators is described in the prior art. For example, 2-hydrazino nicotinamide (HYNIC) has been widely used in the presence of a coligand for incorporation of 99mTc and 186,188Re (Schwartz et al., Bioconj. Chem., 1991, 2, 333-336; Babich et al., J. Nucl. Med., 1993, 34, 1964-1970; Babich et al., Nucl. Med. Biol., 1995, 22, 25-30). DTPA is used in Octreoscan® (Covidien), for complexing 111In and several modifications are described in the literature (Brechbiel et al., Bioconj. Chem., 1991, 2, 187-194; Li et al., Nucl Med. Biol, 2001, 28, 145-154). DOTA type chelators have been reported for radiotherapy applications by Tweedle et al. (US 4,885,363). Certain polyaza macrocycles for chelating trivalent isotopes metals have been disclosed by Maecke et al. (Maecke et al., Bioconj. Chem., 2002, 13, 530-541). N4-chelators such as a 99mTc-N4-chelator have been used for peptide labeling in the case of minigastrin for targeting CCK-2 receptors (Nock et al., J. Nucl Med., 2005, 46, 1727-1736).
Metal chelators for trivalent metals or pentavalent metals and their closely related analogs are, e.g., disclosed in WO 2009/109332 A1. The use of the above chelators for divalent and tetravalent radionuclides has been reported (Dalton Transactions 44,11 (2015), 4845-4858; Journal of Labelled Compounds and Radiopharmaceuticals 57,4 (2014), 224-230; Nuclear Medicine and Biology 40,1 (2013), 3-14; and Chemical Society Reviews 43,1 (2014), 260-290).

The chelator group is preferably -(hydrocarbon group which contains from 8 to 40 carbon atoms, 2 to 12 nitrogen atoms and optionally 1 to 10 oxygen atoms and/or optionally 1 to 5 sulfur atoms and/or optionally 1 to 5 phosphor atoms).
Preferred examples of the chelator group comprise at least two groups selected from carboxylic acid, phosphinic acid, phosphonic acid and hydroxylamine.
Preferred examples of the chelator group are selected from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), 2,2',2"-(1,4,7-triazonane-1,4,7-triyl)triacetic acid (NOTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diiacetic acid (NODA), N,N'-bis-[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (HBED-CC), 3,6,9,15-tetraazabicyclo[9.3.1]pentadeca-1(15),11,13-triene-3,6,9,-triacetic acid (PCTA), diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), N'-{5-[acetyl(hydroxy)amino]pentyl}-N-[5-({4-[(5-aminopentyl)(hydroxy)amino]-4-oxobutanoyl}amino)pentyl]-N-hydroxysuccinamide (DFO), 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,8,11-tetraacetic acid (TETA), ethylenediamine-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N-glutaric acid-N',N"-diacetic acid (NODAGA), 1,4,7- triazacyclononane-1-succinic acid-4,7-diacetic acid (NODASA), 1,4,7,10 tetraazacyclotridecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (TRITA), trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA), 1-[2-(2-mercapto-2-methyl-propylamino)-ethylamino]-2-methyl-propane-2-thiol (BAT), 6-hydrazino-nicotinic acid (HYNIC), 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-bis[methylene(hydroxymethyl)phosphinic acid]-7-[methylene(2-carboxyethyl)phosphinic acid] and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane phosphinic acid.These chelator groups may be attached to the linker groups in any manner. For example, the chelator group may be attached to a linker group via a nitrogen atom within a heterocyclic ring or chain of the chelator group or via a carboxylic acid in one of the side chains of the chelator group.
Certain chelator groups may be described by the following partial formula<img> id-imgb0005.tif </img>wherein T is -[(CR52)m(NR6)]q(CR52)m-.Although a bond is depicted at the nitrogen atom in the ring, such chelator groups can also be bound to the remained of the compound of formula (I) via other groups of the chelator group, such as via the side chains.

The lipophilicity of 177Lu-14 (FAUC Lu469) was assessed by determination of the water-octanol partition coefficient. 1-Octanol (0.5 mL) was added to a solution of approximately 25 kBq of 177Lu-14 in PBS (0.5 mL, pH 7.4) and the layers were vigorously mixed for 3 min at room temperature. The tubes were centrifuged (14000 rpm, 1 min) and three samples of 100 µL of each layer were counted in a γ-counter (Wallac Wizard). The partition coefficient was determined by calculating the ratio cpm (octanol)/cpm (PBS) and expressed as logD7.4) log(cpmoctanol/cpmbuffer). The experiments were performed in triplicates. The logD7.4 value was determined to be -1.8 ± 0.1 (mean value ± standard deviation, n=6).
Animal Models
Athymic nude mice (nu/nu) were obtained from Harlan Winkelmann GmbH (Borchen, Germany) at 4 weeks of age and were kept under standard conditions (12 h light/dark) with food and water available ad libitum. AsPC-1, PC-3 or HT29 cells were harvested and suspended in sterile PBS at a concentration of 2×107 cells/ml. Viable cells (2×106) in PBS (100 µL) were injected subcutaneously in the back. Two weeks after inoculation (tumor weight: 400-800 mg), the mice (about 10-12 weeks old with about 40 g body weight) were used for biodistribution studies.
Biodistribution Studies
The xenografted mice were injected with 177Lu-14 (FAUC Lu469, 1 MBq/mouse) intravenously into the tail vein. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at 24 h and 48 h post-injection (p.i.). Tumors and other tissues (blood, lung, liver, kidneys, heart, brain, muscle and intestine) were removed and weighed. Radioactivity of the dissected tissues was determined using a γ-counter. Results were expressed as percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g), and tumor-to-organ ratios were calculated. Results are reported as percent injected dose per gram (%ID/g) in Table 2 andFigure 1.

Therapy study
Nude mice bearing PC3 tumors at the back were used for the therapy study. One week after inoculation of the PC3 cells, 177Lu-14 (FAUC Lu469) was injected in four mice at a dose of 30±9 MBq/animal. Eight additional animals were injected with saline as control animals. The body weight and the tumor diameter was measured every three days. The result of the tumor growth over time after starting the treatment is shown in Figure 2. Animals injected with 177Lu-14 (FAUC Lu469) showed a significantly inhibited tumor growth and a reduction in tumor size in comparison with untreated control animals. The tumor inhibition growth factor was 64% after 49 days. Consequently, the treated animals showed significantly longer survival than the untreated control animals (Figure 2).
As has been shown by the above examples, the present invention provides radiopharmaceuticals that show low binding to dopamine receptors and improved selectivity for NTS1. This increased selectivity improves the achievable data quality in diagnosis and imaging of NTS1-positive tumors and thus opens new opportunities for early detection of NTS1-positive tumors. Furthermore, the increased selectivity along with the excellent activity of the compounds of the present invention is expected to provide new therapeutic opportunities, in particular in the treatment of cancer.
