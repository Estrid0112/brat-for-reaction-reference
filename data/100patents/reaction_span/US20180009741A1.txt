TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure is directed to hydrazone compounds and pharmaceutical compositions including same having antifungal activity and methods for treating or preventing fungal conditions in a subject in need thereof by administering same.
BACKGROUND
The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and fungi as human pathogens warrants a continued focus on the development of new pharmacophores for the treatment of these devastating and often fatal infections. The rise of multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), adversely affects the efficacy of many known, standard-of-care, antibacterial agents. Evidence of the impact of these multidrug-resistant strains appears in a 2011 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that estimates that the national incidence of invasive MRSA infections was 80,461 cases and 650 deaths. This mortality rate is among the highest recorded for bacterial infections. Likewise, listerosis, which is a common foodborne illness caused by Listeria monocytogenes, represents a serious illness afflicting elderly people, newborns, and those with impaired immune systems. Estimates suggest that L. monocytogenes causes 19% of deaths associated with the consumption of contaminated foods in the United States.
The incidence of invasive fungal infections is also on the rise due to an increasing population of critically ill patients as a result of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), systemic diseases such as cancer, and the increasing role of organ transplantation. The National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) at the CDC has reported that Candida spp. ranked fifth among hospital-acquired pathogens. Candida spp. fungi have also been reported as the fourth most common causative pathogens of nosocomial, often fatal bloodstream infections. Eukaryotic C. albicans share a close evolutionary relationship as well as many cellular mechanisms with their human hosts and present therapeutic challenges for new treatments for systemic fungal infections. There is an unquestioned need for new antimicrobials that selectively inhibit these microorganisms without causing host toxicity.
Pentamidine represents an archetypical, biscationic antibiotic with a symmetrical structure containing two amidinium functional groups separated by a flexible 1,5-diphenoxypentane spacer. Developed initially as an antiprotozoal agent, it currently finds applications in both the treatment of protozoan diseases, such as Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (West African trypanosomiasis) as well as systemic fungal infections caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii, often seen in patients with HIV. Related compounds include symmetrical bisamidines, (e.g., furimidazoline), developed principally as topoisomerase inhibitors for cancer treatments. In addition to these biscationic compounds, other hydrazone- and guanidine-containing molecules possess a range of promising biological activities including antituberculosis, anti-HIV, anticonvulsant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial, antibacterial, and antifungal activities. Recently, bis(N-amidino)hydrazones were reported to inhibit the calcium-dependent serine endoprotease, furin, which activates immature proteins to their functional, mature form.
Accordingly, a continuing need exists for the development of specific antifungal agents for the treatment and prevention of fungal diseases and infections.

EXAMPLES
The following examples are intended to illustrate certain preferred embodiments of the invention and are not limiting in nature. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific substances and procedures described herein.
Example 1
To show the potential of various compounds disclosed herein, nine symmetrical bis(N-amidino)hydrazones (3A-B and 4A,C-H) and eight asymmetrical N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones (7Aa-Ag and 8Aa) (Scheme 1, FIGS. A-B) were synthesized, and their antibacterial and antifungal activities were evaluated against panels of bacterial strains (four Gram-positive, six Gram-negative, and one mycobacterial) and seven Candida albicans strains. Because the development of resistance represents a crucial problem in antimicrobial drug development, the potential of resistance development by bacteria and fungi against these compounds was also established. Additionally, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured in yeast cells of some of these compounds, and the compounds in vitro cytotoxicity as well as the compounds minimal affinity, which is desired, for the hERG potassium channel was determined. The combination of testing new antimicrobial agents and early screening for resistance and toxicity represent an avenue most likely to produce pharmacophores of potential utility in disease treatment.
Chemical Synthesis of Biscationic Compounds with Two, Chemically Identical Termini
To form the biscationic hydrazones of formula (III) with two N-amidino groups, the carbonyl groups in either bisaldehyde 1 or bisketone 2, which in some cases were in regiochemically distinct positions in the spacer (e.g., 1B, 2B, 2H), were modified with N-aminoguanidine hydrochloride to obtain the biscationic products 3 and 4, respectively (FIG. 1A). To form the biscationic hydrazones of formula (IV) with two N-aryl groups, the carbonyl groups in either bisaldehyde 1 or bisketone 2, which in some cases were in regiochemically distinct positions in the spacer (e.g., 1B, 2B, 2H), were modified with N-arylhydrazines to obtain the biscationic products 9 and 10, respectively (FIG. 1B).
Design and Chemical Synthesis of Biscationic Compounds with Chemically Non-Identical Termini
Literature approaches for the synthesis of bicationic agents with two chemically non-identical termini typically involved the construction of the spacer as the ultimate step. For example, the coupling of an amidino-substituted naphthol with a guanidine-substituted benzoic acid secured biscationic esters with an amidinium group at one terminus and a guandinium group at the other. The synthetic approach that is reported here differed from this strategy in that a stepwise, chemoselective modification of bisaldehydes 1 or bisketones 2 was used to arrive at biscationic systems with different cationic groups at each terminus. Condensations of one equivalent of N-aminoguanidine hydrochloride with 1A and 2A led to the efficient production of monosubstituted N-amidinohydrazones 5A and 6A, respectively (FIG. 1B). The hydrochloride salts of these monocatioinic products were readily crystallized and thereby were isolated free from starting materials and suitable for the subsequent synthesis of the biscationic agents. For example, the subsequent treatment of 5A and 6A with N-arylhydrazines furnished the desired, biscationic agents 7Aa-Ag and 8Aa, respectively, which we describe as N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones (FIG. 1B). Cavallini described the monocationic N-amidinohydrazones as antibacterial agents some years ago, but the range of organisms and MIC50 values were, in general, unimpressive. No effort was made by Cavallini to examine organisms which represent the most imminent threat to human health.
The antibacterial and antifungal properties of bis(N-amidino)hydrazones 3 and 4 and N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones 7 and 8 were evaluated as discussed below.
Antibacterial Activity
To determine if bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones displayed antibacterial activity, compounds 3A-8Aa were evaluated against a panel of Gram-positive (4 strains), Gram-negative (6 strains), and one mycobacterial strain using the aminoglycoside amikacin (AMK), the β-lactam ampicillin (AMP), and the fluoroquinolone ofloxacin (OFX) as positive controls in a concentration range of 0.5-500 μM. The results are provided in Table 1 below.

</table>
In general, the compounds displayed excellent (MIC values ≦0.5-7.8 μM), intermediate (15.6-31.3 μM), or low (62.5-≧500 μM) antibacterial activity against the bacterial strains tested.
Overall, when analyzing the MIC data obtained against the Gram-positive bacterial strains (strains A-D), it was noticed that most of the bis(N-amidino)hydrazones (3A,B, 4C,D, 4F) and N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones (7Aa-Ad, and 7Af-Ag) showed excellent antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (strain B) (MIC <0.5-7.8 μM), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (strain C) (MIC=1.0-7.8 μM), and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) (strain D) (MIC=1.0-7.8 μM). All of the compounds displayed poor activity against Bacillus subtilis 168 (strain A), with the exception of compound 4F, which displayed good activity (MIC=7.8 μM) against this strain. Likewise, compound 7Ae exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (strain B; MIC=7.8 μM) and VRE (strain D; MIC=2.0-3.9 μM) but only moderate antibacterial activity against B. subtilis 168 (strain A; MIC=31.3 μM) and MRSA (strain C; MIC=15.6 μM), respectively. Overall, compound 4F was found to be the most active against Gram-positive bacteria.
Compound 4A exhibited potent activity against P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (strain I; MIC=2.0 μM) and moderate activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736 (strain H; MIC=15.6 μM). Similarly, compound 4F also displayed excellent antibacterial activities against strain I (MIC=1.0-2.0 μM) and S. enterica ATCC 14028 (strain J; MIC=3.9 μM), as well as moderate to low activity against strain H (MIC=31.3-62.5 μM). Additionally, 7Ae showed only moderate antibacterial activities against strain H (MIC=15.6-31.3 μM), strain I (MIC=31.3-62.5 μM), and strain J (MIC=15.6 μM). Compounds 3B, 4C-D, 4F, 7Aa-Ad, and 7Af-Ag exhibited excellent antibacterial activity (MIC values ranging from 1.0-3.9 μM) against M. smegmatis MC2-155 (strain K), whereas compounds 411 and 7Ae showed only moderate activity (15.6-31.3 μM) and compounds 3A, 4A, 4E, 4G, and 8Aa showed low activity (125->500 μM) against this mycobacterial strain. It is noteworthy to mention that when compared to clinically relevant antibacterial drugs, such as AMK (MIC=3.9-125 μM), AMP (MIC≧250 μM), and OFX (MIC≦0.5-31.3 μM), the compounds reported here showed either superior or comparable antibacterial activity against all bacterial strains tested relative to these clinical agents.

Control antifungal agent: AmB = amphotericin B.
</table>
The common antifungal agent amphotericin B (AmB) was used as a positive control. It was observed that compounds 3B, 4F, 7Aa, 7Ab, and 7Af showed excellent antifungal activities against all fungal strains tested, with 4F showing superior (MIC=1.0-3.9 μg/mL) activity. Similarly, compound 4A also displayed potent antifungal activities (MIC=2.0-3.9 μg/mL) against most strains except against C. albicans ATCC 1003 (MIC=7.8 μg/mL) and C. albicans ATCC 1237 (MIC=31.3 μg/mL). Compounds 7Ad, 7Ae, 7Ag, and 8Aa showed only moderate fungal growth inhibition (MIC=7.8-15.6 μg/mL) against the majority of the fungal strains with the exception of C. albicans ATCC 64124 (MIC=31.3 μg/mL for 7Ae, 7Ag, and 8Aa), C. albicans ATCC 90819 (MIC=31.3 μg/mL for 7Ag), C. albicans ATCC 1003 (MIC=3.9 μg/mL for 7Ad) and C. albicans ATCC 2310 (MIC=3.9 μg/mL for 7Ad). Compounds 7Ac also exhibited excellent growth inhibition against most of the fungal strains tested, except against C. albicans ATCC 10231 (moderate activity, MIC=7.8 μg/mL) and C. albicans ATCC 64124 (poor activity, MIC=31.3 μg/mL). It is important to emphasize that most of the bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and N-amidino-N-aryl-bishydrazones displayed either superior or comparable antifungal activities against the majority of the fungal strains tested, when compared to the clinically relevant antifungal agents, AmB (MIC=2.0-3.9 μg/mL).
SAR analysis. Variations in SAR outcomes for compounds studied as antibacterial or as antifungal agents was expected given that bacteria are prokaryotic organisms and fungi are eukaryotic organisms.
Based upon the antibacterial and antifungal results presented in Tables 1 and 2, it was determined that with respect to bis(N-amidino)hydrazones, linkers comprised of a single phenyl ring, regardless of its substitution pattern (para or meta, as in compounds 4G and 4H, respectively), displayed diminished but not non-existent antimicrobial activity as compared to the other linkers disclosed herein. Additionally, comparing the MIC value profiles of compounds 3A and 4A as well as 7Aa and 8Aa, which only differ by the absence or presence of a methyl group on the carbons alpha to the phenyl rings indicated that the methyl group diminished antibacterial activity of these compounds relative to cases where the carbons alpha to the phenyl rings contained a hydrogen. However, the presence of the methyl group appeared beneficial in terms of antifungal activity. For example, compound 4A was overall a much better antifungal agent than compound 3A. Turning to the antibacterial MIC values for compounds 3A and 3B, it was observed that they were about equivalent in all cases, except against strain K where the MIC value for compound 3B (MIC=1 μM) was much lower than that for compound 3A (MIC>500 μM). From these data, it was deduced that the substitution patterns of the biphenyl linkers had minimal effects on antibacterial activity. However, the substitution patterns of the biphenyl linkers were found to have a substantial effect on antifungal activity. For example, compound 3B was a much better antifungal agent than compound 3A.
With respect to the length of the flexible, linear, alkyl spacer between the two phenyl rings, comparing the MIC values of compounds 4A, 4C, and 4D, once again showed opposing trends in antibacterial and antifungal activities. In particular, increasing the length of the flexible alkyl linker between the two phenyl rings resulted in a decrease in antibacterial MIC values, whereas this same increase in the length of the linker resulted in an increase in antifungal MIC values. As to rigidity of the linker, by contrasting the MIC value profile of compound 4C containing a flexible linker to that of compound 4F containing a rigid linker, it was concluded that introducing rigidity in the linker was beneficial for antimicrobial activity. In contrast to rigidity, a comparison of the MIC value profiles of compounds 4C and 4E indicated that replacing the methylene bridging the two phenyl groups of the linker with an oxygen atom had no effect on antifungal activity, but was detrimental to antibacterial activity.
Next, by comparing compounds 7Aa-7Ag, it was observed that the nature of the substituent in the ortho position of the mono-substituted aryl group of compounds 7Aa and 7Ab did not affect antibacterial or antifungal activity, whereas the nature of the substituent in the para position of the mono-substituted aryl group of compounds 7Ac-7Ae had the opposing effects on antibacterial (CN>halogen) and antifungal (halogen>CN) activity. It was also observed that the o,p-difluorinated and o,p-dichlorinated aryl moieties of compounds 7Af and 7Ag had similar overall antibacterial activity, but different antifungal activity, in which the o,p-difluorinated group possessed improved antifungal activity. Finally, with regard to the effect of substitution pattern of the aryl ring (ortho versus para-monosubstituted versus ortho,para-disubstituted) on antimicrobial activity, a comparison of the activity resulting from different chlorination patterns in compounds 7Aa (ortho), 7Ad (para), and 7Ag (o,p-diC1), indicated that these changes had minimal effects on antibacterial activity but substantial effects on antifungal activity. The o-chlorinated N-amidino-N-aryl-bishydrazone was superior to the p-chlorinated analog, which in turn was much better than o,p-dichlorinated analog.
Development of Bacterial and Fungal Resistance Studies
The emergence of antibiotic resistance by microbes is an inevitable process; however, the frequency at which resistance develops varies from one antibiotic to another. It is critical to assess the ability of new antimicrobials to evade, as long as possible, the development of bacterial and fungal resistance early in the development process.
To establish if the bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and N-amidino-N-aryl-bishydrazones evaded resistance in bacteria, a multi-step resistance selection experiment was performed with compounds 4D, 4F, and 7Aa and with AMK as a reference drug against four bacterial strains (FIG. 2). L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (strain B), MRSA (strain C), VRE (strain D), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (strain I) were exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of compounds 4D, 4F, 7Aa, and AMK, and were sub-cultured for 15 serial passages to determine if any increase in MIC values occurred for each compounds against the strains tested. L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (strain B), MRSA (strain C), VRE (strain D), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (strain I) did not develop resistance to compound 4F, as established by the fact that the relative MIC values increased only by one-fold after 15 serial passages. Likewise, strains B and D did not develop resistance to compound 7Aa, but strains C and I developed resistance to this compound after twelve serial passages. In contrast, the rapid development of resistance to compound 4D was observed in strains C and D with a 16-fold increase in MIC values after fifteen serial passages. This resistance development against compound 4D was also observed in strains B and I, where increases in relative MIC values by 8- and 4-folds were observed after 15 passages. Interestingly, in strains D and I, resistance to the control antibiotic, AMK, was also observed after 3 and 5 passages, respectively, whereas in strains C and B, resistance developed after 12 and 15 passages, respectively. Overall, these results indicate that there is a low probability of emergence of resistance to the antifungal, biscationic compounds 4F and 7Aa.
The potential development of drug resistance in C. albicans ATCC 10231 to antifungal compounds 7Aa and 4F was investigated. The results indicated that C. albicans ATCC 10231 was unable to develop drug resistance to either 7Aa or 4F, despite repeated treatments with sub-MIC drug concentrations. Only a slight 2-fold shift in relative MIC values was observed after 13 passages. These results also suggested the appearance of drug resistance by fungi to the antifungal compounds of the present disclosure is highly unlikely, a particularly desirable outcome.
Measurement of ROS Induction in Fungal Cells
Various antifungal drugs, such as AmB and miconazole, as well as the antifungal agents of the present disclosure, were shown to mediate their inhibitory effect by inducing intracellular ROS production. Universally, eukaryotic cells produce basal amount of ROS in mitochondria as a byproduct of cellular metabolism. In response, the cellular enzymatic antioxidants, including superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, scavenge ROS in cells. However, overproduction of deleterious ROS perturbs the delicate, intracellular equilibrium between ROS production and scavenging, and results in cellular damage.
To show the ability of compounds 4F and 7Aa to alter ROS production in C. albicans ATCC 10231 (strain A), a fluorescent-based assay was performed using a 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) dye. It was found that treatment of C. albicans ATCC 10231 (strain A) with compounds 4F and 7Aa at their 1× and 2×MIC values significantly increased intracellular ROS production in this fungal strain (FIG. 3). As expected, an H2O2 positive control (at 1 mM) also induced ROS production in yeast cell, whereas no ROS induction was observed with untreated yeast cells (negative control).
Cytotoxicity
Another important aspect to consider during the development of antimicrobial agents is their potential toxicity towards mammalian cells. Having established the potent antimicrobial activities of the bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones against bacteria and fungi, the toxicity profile of these compounds was determined against two mammalian cell lines (A549 and BEAS-2B; FIGS. 4A-B). The majority of the compounds showed dose-dependent toxicity with IC50 values of 1.95-3.9 μg/mL against these cell lines. Compounds 3B, 7Ac, 7Ad, and 7Af with antibacterial MIC values of <0.4-3.3 μg/mL, displayed good IC50 values of 7.8-15.6 μg/mL against both mammalian cell lines. It is important to remember that compounds 7Ac and 7Af also displayed strong antifungal MIC values.
hERG Inhibition Assay
The human Ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that plays an essential role in regulating heart rhythm. Inhibition of the potassium channel coded by hERG disrupts the heart rhythm and may lead to death. Recently, clinically used drugs (e.g., terfendadine and cisapride) were withdrawn from the market due to their interaction with hERG. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) require testing of hERG affinity for potential novel drugs during the early stage of the drug development.
A [3H]-dofetilide competition binding assay using HEK-293 cell membranes stably expressing hERG channel was performed to evaluate interaction of the most potent bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones with hERG (FIG. 5). Compounds exhibiting IC50 values of >10 μM are considered to have desirable, low affinity for the hERG channel. Compounds displaying IC50 values in the range of 1-10 μM are considered moderate inhibitors, whereas compounds exhibiting ICso values of <1 μM are considered to have undesirable, high affinity for the hERG channel. The majority of the compounds of the present disclosure displayed ICso values within the acceptable range of 1-10 μM (FIG. 5) against the hERG channel. For example, the p-fluorophenyl and the 2,4-difluorophenyl groups in compounds 7Ac and 7Af displayed only moderate inhibition of the hERG channel with IC50 values of 3.29±0.625 μM and 2.24±0.701 μM, respectively. Strikingly, both of these compounds displayed excellent antifungal activities and also exerted low mammalian cell toxicity. Similarly, compounds 4F and 7Aa also displayed moderate inhibition of hERG channel with ICso values of 1.12±0.317 μM and 1.14±0.267 μM, respectively; however, they displayed some toxicity against mammalian cells. Therefore, it was concluded, once again, that compounds 7Ac and 7Af are the most promising N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones.

Materials and instrumentation. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich-Fluka (PO Box 14508 St. Louis, Mo., 63178, USA), Matrix, Inc. (131 Pontiac Business Center Dr., Elgin, S.C., 29045, USA), and Thermo-Scientific (7383 Empire Dr., Florence, Key., 41042, USA), or were synthesized according to literature procedures, unless otherwise noted. Solvents were used from commercial vendors without further purification unless otherwise noted. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were determined in DMSO-d6 using an Agilent 400 series NMR instrument. The DMSO center line was set as the reference at 2.5 ppm for 1H NMR spectra and at 39.51 ppm for 13C NMR spectra. LRMS electron-impact (EI) ionization mass spectra were recorded at 70 eV on a ThermoFinnigan PolarisQ (ion trap mass spectrometer). Samples were introduced via a heatable direct probe inlet. High-resolution electron impact (EI) ionization mass spectra were recorded at 25 eV on a JEOL JMS-700T MStation (magnetic sector instrument) at a resolution of greater than 10,000. Samples were introduced via heatable direct probe inlet. MALDI mass spectra were obtained on a Bruker Utraflexstreme time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Billerica, Mass.), using DHB (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) matrix. Purity of compounds was >95% as established by combustion analyses. In the case of compounds that resisted crystallization or were too valuable to sacrifice to combustion, purity was established by a combination of high-resolution mass spectra and 13C NMR data. Elemental analyses were determined by Atlantic Microlabs, Inc. (6180 Atlantic Blvd # M, Norcross, Ga., 30071, USA). Compounds were chromatographed on preparative layer Merck silica gel F254 or columns using MP Silica 63-200, 60 Å, MP EcoChrom (Eschwege, Germany). Organic solutions were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 unless otherwise noted.
Experimental Procedures and Characterization of Compounds 3A-8Aa:
General procedure for the synthesis of aryl bis[N-(guanidino)imines] 3A-4H. To a solution of aminoguanidine hydrochloride (2 mmol, 2 eq) in 3 mL of absolute EtOH at 78° C. was added 1 mmol (1 eq) of bisaldehyde 1 (R═H) or bisketone 2 (R═CH3) and 10 μL of concentrated HCl. The mixture was heated for 2 h and cooled to 0° C. The resulting white solid was filtered and washed with 2 mL of cold EtOH to afford aryl N-(guanidino)imines 3A-B and 4A,C-H as dihydrochloride salts.

General procedure for the synthesis of aryl N-(guanidino)imines N'-arylhydrazones 7Aa-Ag and 8Aa. To 40.5 mmol (3 eq) of a bis(aldehyde) 1A (R═H) or bis(ketone) 2A (R═CH3) in 20 mL of absolute EtOH at 78° C. was added dropwise a solution of 1.5 g (13.5 mmol, 1 eq) of aminoguanidine hydrochloride in 80 mL of 1:15/H2O:EtOH. To this solution was added 2 mL of concentrated HCl, and the mixture was heated for an additional 12 h. The mixture was concentrated under vacuum to afford a solid. The solid was heated with ca. 10 mL of EtOAc to dissolve any unreacted dicarbonyl compound, as confirmed by TLC of the undissolved solid using 1:50/MeOH:CH2Cl2. After decanting the EtOAc solution, the remaining white precipitate consisted of the monosubstituted N-(guanidino)imine 5A and 6A that was used directly in the next step. To 113 mg (0.5 mmol, 1 eq) of 5A or 6A suspended in 2 mL of absolute EtOH at 78° C. was added 0.5 mmol (1 eq) of an aryl hydrazine followed by 0.02 mL of concentrated HCl. A clear solution was produced by the addition of acid, and within 15-30 min, a precipitate was formed. The mixture was heated at 78° C. for 24 h, and the precipitate was collected by filtration of the hot mixture. The precipitate was washed cold absolute EtOH to yield >95% of pure unsymmetrical aryl N-(guanidino)imines N'-arylhydrazones 7Aa-Ag and 8Aa.

Determination of MIC values for compounds 3A-B, 4A,C-H, 7Aa-Ag, and 8Aa as antibacterials. MIC values were determined against a variety of Gram-positive (strains A-D) and Gram-negative (E-J) bacterial and mycobacterial (K) strains using the double-dilution method, as previously published. Preliminary screening was performed using 500 μM of each compound. Compounds that were found to inhibit the growth of bacteria at 500 μM were then tested in a range of 0.5 to 250 μM, and bacteria were grown at 37° C. in Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth.
Development of bacterial resistance. The development of resistance of L. monocytogenes ATCC 19115 (strain B), MRSA (strain C), VRE (strain D), and P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (strain I) to compounds 4D, 4F, and 7Aa as well as AMK as a reference was determined by following a previously published protocol. The bacteria were grown in MH broth at 37° C. for these experiments. Briefly, the ½ MIC concentration, from an active MIC experiments, was diluted 1:100 and grown overnight at 37° C. The resulting cultures were diluted 1:1000 and grown until the culture reached ˜300,000 cfu/mL. That culture was then further diluted 1:1000 and used to determine the next round of MIC values. MIC values were determined every other day for a total of 15 rounds (Note: for the bacterial strains that developed resistance to compounds prior to the 15 passages, the MIC value determination was discontinued post resistance observation). The fold changes of the MIC values were determined and these data are presented in FIG. 2.
Determination of MIC values for compounds 3A-B, 4A,C-H, 7Aa-Ag, and 8Aa as antifungals. In vitro MIC testing was performed according to the CLSI M27-A3 standard microbroth dilution methodology for the susceptibility testing of yeasts with minor modifications. Briefly, serial dilutions of the test compounds as well as a reference compound, AmB, were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium (catalog # R6504, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) buffered to pH 7 with 0.165 M morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.) using 96-well plates in a range of 0.48-31.2 μg/mL, and microtiter plates were then incubated at 35° C. for 2 days. MIC values were read visually for all tested compounds, and the endpoint was determined as the minimum concentration of compound that yielded complete inhibition relative to growth control.
Development of fungal resistance. C. albicans ATCC 10231 was used to perform the development of resistance of this strain to compounds 4F and 7Aa, as well as AmB as a reference. Firstly, MIC values of 4F, 7Aa, and POS against this strain were determined in 96-well plates using RPMI 1640 medium at 35° C. for 48 h. Aliquot of 10 μL from the well that was showing the ½ MIC values were subcultured into PDA and grown overnight at 35° C. A single colony was picked to inoculate fresh RPMI 1640 medium and that culture was used to determine the next round of MIC values. The MIC values for each compound were determined every third day for a total of 15 passages of MIC determination. The fold changes of the MIC values were determined and these data are presented in FIG. 2.
Assays for reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. We used the 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) dye as a probe to measure the production of ROS in yeast cells upon treatment with our compounds. DCFH-DA can easily cross the cell membranes and be hydrolyzed by cellular esterases to the non-fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCFH), which can further be oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) by the intracellular ROS. Five mL of RPMI 1640 medium were inoculated using a single colony of C. albicans ATCC 10231 (strain A) in a Falcon tube and grown overnight at 35° C. at 200 rpm. The overnight culture was diluted by adding 200 μL of yeast cells to 800 μL of the same medium. Cell suspension (100 μL) was added to the RPMI 1640 medium containing no drug (negative control) or compounds 4F and 7Aa at their 1× and 2× MIC values, and treated for 1 h at 35° C. H2O2 at 1 mM was also used as a positive control. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with PBS buffer (pH 7.2). Cells were resuspended in the same buffer and incubated with DCFH-DA (20 μg/mL) for 30 min in the dark. Afterwards, cells were centrifuged and washed with PBS buffer to remove excess DCFH-DA. Glass slides with 10-15 μL of each mixture were prepared and observed in bright field and fluorescence modes (FITC filter set, excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 512 nm, respectively) using a Zeiss Axovert 200M fluorescence microscope (FIG. 3).
Toxicity studies. Cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described. The human lung carcinoma epithelial cells A549 and the normal human bronchial epithelial cells BEAS-2B were grown in F12-K and DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics, respectively. The confluent cells were trypsinized with 0.05%-trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA, centrifuged (1,200 rpm) and resuspended in fresh medium (F12-K or DMEM). The cells were seeded into 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 3,000 cells/well and were grown overnight. The following day, the media were replaced by 100 μL of fresh culture media containing serially diluted compounds 3A-B, 4A,C-H, and 7Aa-Af, as well as a reference compound, AmB, (at final concentrations of 0.24-31.2 μg/mL or sterile ddH2O (negative control). The cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Each well was treated with 10 μL (25 μg/mL) of resazurin sodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3-6 h to determine cell viability. Metabolically active cells can convert the blue non-fluorescent dye resazurin to the pink and highly fluorescent dye resorufin, which can be detected at A560 excitation and A590 emission wavelengths by using a SpectraMax M5 plate reader. Triton X-100® (0.5%, v/v) gave complete loss of cell viability and was used as the positive control. The percent cell survival was calculated as: (test value/control value)×100, where control value represents cells+resazurin−drug, and test value represents cells+resazurin+drug. These data are presented in FIGS. 4A-B.
Cell-based [3H]dofetilide binding assay. HEK-293 cell membranes which specifically and stably express the hERG channel protein were prepared and harvested as previously described. Assays were conducted in duplicate, and three independent assays were performed for each compound that was evaluated. Cell membrane suspension (5 μg) was added to duplicate tubes containing assay buffer (50 mM Tris, 10 mM KCl, and 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4), 25 μL of a single concentration of analogue (a concentration range of 10 nM-100 μM was employed for each experiment), and 25 μL of [3H]dofetilide (5 nM, final concentration) for an assay volume of 250 μL. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 1 mM amitriptyline. Binding occurred for 60 min at 25° C. and was terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B filters, which were pre-soaked in 0.5% PEI for 2 h. Filters were washed three times with ˜1 mL of ice-cold assay buffer. Radioactivity retained by the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting by using a Tri-Carb 2100TR liquid scintillation analyzer (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Boston, Mass.).

In summary, amidinohydrazone compounds such as nine bis(N-amidino)hydrazones and eight N-amidino-N'-aryl-bishydrazones were shown to have antifungal activity and their activity was not readily predicable from their antibacterial activity. In addition, the amidinohydrazone compounds displayed low potential for resistance development, and were found to induce ROS production in a C. albicans strain. They were also found to display reasonable toxicity profiles against two mammalian cell lines as well as only moderate, acceptable hERG channel inhibition. In light of our SAR study, compounds 4F, 7Ac, and 7Af, were preferred embodiments of the disclosure.
Only the preferred embodiment of the present invention and examples of its versatility are shown and described in the present disclosure. It is to be understood that the present invention is capable of use in various other combinations and environments and is capable of changes or modifications within the scope of the inventive concept as expressed herein. Thus, for example, those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain, using no more than routine experimentation, numerous equivalents to the specific substances, procedures and arrangements described herein. Such equivalents are considered to be within the scope of this invention, and are covered by the following claims.
