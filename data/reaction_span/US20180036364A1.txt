FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention described herein pertains to drug delivery conjugates for targeted therapy. The invention described herein relates to methods of treating PSMA expressing cancers with a PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound. The invention described herein also relates to methods of treating PSMA-expressing cancers with a PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound in patients where stable disease results after treatment with the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound.
BACKGROUND
Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II cell surface membrane-bound glycoprotein with ˜110 kD molecular weight, including an intracellular segment (amino acids 1-18), a transmembrane domain (amino acids 19-43), and an extensive extracellular domain (amino acids 44-750). While the functions of the intracellular segment and the transmembrane domains are currently believed to be insignificant, the extracellular domain is involved in several distinct activities. PSMA plays a role in the central nervous system, where it metabolizes N-acetyl-aspartyl glutamate (NAAG) into glutamic and N-acetyl aspartic acid. Accordingly, it is also sometimes referred to as an N-acetyl alpha linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase). PSMA is also sometimes referred to as a folate hydrolase I (FOLH I) or glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCP II) due to its role in the proximal small intestine where it removes γ-linked glutamate from poly-γ-glutamated folate and α-linked glutamate from peptides and small molecules.
PSMA is named largely due to its higher level of expression on prostate cancer cells; however, its particular function on prostate cancer cells remains unresolved. PSMA is over-expressed in the malignant prostate tissues when compared to other organs in the human body such as kidney, proximal small intestine, and salivary glands. Unlike many other membrane-bound proteins, PSMA undergoes rapid internalization into the cell in a similar fashion to cell surface bound receptors like vitamin receptors. PSMA is internalized through clathrin-coated pits and subsequently can either recycle to the cell surface or go to lysosomes. It has been suggested that the dimer and monomer form of PSMA are inter-convertible, though direct evidence of the interconversion is being debated. Even so, only the dimer of PSMA possesses enzymatic activity, and the monomer does not.
Though the activity of the PSMA on the cell surface of the prostate cells remains under investigation, it has been recognized by the inventors herein that PSMA represents a viable target for the selective and/or specific delivery of biologically active agents, including drug compounds and imaging agents to such prostate cells. One such drug compound is tubulysin, which when conjugated to PSMA through an appropriately functionalized linker provides PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I

(also referred to herein as 99mTc-EC0652 or 99mTc-Conjugate IIa) as described in WO2009/026177, which is incorporated herein by reference. Imaging conjugate IIIa has found use as a cancer imaging agent as described in, for example, WO2009/026177. One of skill in the art will recognize that imaging conjugate IIIa can exist as syn- and anti-isomers in reference to the relative position of the Tc═O double bond.

Depending upon the cancer type as described herein, the route of administration and/or whether the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound and/or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates are administered locally or systemically, a wide range of permissible dosages are contemplated herein, including doses falling in the range from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg. The dosages may be single or divided, and may administered according to a wide variety of protocols, including q.d., b.i.d., t.i.d., or even every other day, biweekly (b.i.w.), once a week, once a month, once a quarter, and the like. In each of these cases it is understood that the therapeutically effective amounts described herein correspond to the instance of administration, or alternatively to the total daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly dose, as determined by the dosing protocol.
In one aspect, a PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or a PSMA ligand-imaging conjugate as described herein may be administered directly into the blood stream, into muscle, or into an internal organ. Suitable routes for such parenteral administration include intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, epidural, intracerebroventricular, intraurethral, intrasternal, intracranial, intratumoral, intramuscular and subcutaneous delivery. Suitable means for parenteral administration include needle (including microneedle) injectors, needle-free injectors and infusion techniques.
In one illustrative aspect, parenteral formulations are typically aqueous solutions which may contain carriers or excipients such as salts, carbohydrates and buffering agents (preferably at a pH of from 3 to 9), but, for some applications, they may be more suitably formulated as a sterile non-aqueous solution or as a dried form to be used in conjunction with a suitable vehicle such as sterile, pyrogen-free water. In other embodiments, any of the liquid formulations described herein may be adapted for parenteral administration of the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates described herein. The preparation of parenteral formulations under sterile conditions, for example, by lyophilization under sterile conditions, may readily be accomplished using standard pharmaceutical techniques well known to those skilled in the art. In one embodiment, the solubility of a PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or a PSMA ligand-imaging conjugate used in the preparation of a parenteral formulation may be increased by the use of appropriate formulation techniques, such as the incorporation of solubility-enhancing agents.
In various embodiments, formulations for parenteral administration may be formulated for immediate and/or modified release. In one illustrative aspect, active agents of the invention (i.e., the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates) may be administered in a time release formulation, for example in a composition which includes a slow release polymer. The active PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates can be prepared with carriers that will protect the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugate against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, polylactic acid and polylactic, polyglycolic copolymers (PGLA). Methods for the preparation of such formulations are generally known to those skilled in the art. In another embodiment, the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates described herein or compositions comprising the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates may be continuously administered, where appropriate.
In one embodiment, a kit is provided. If a combination of active PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound and PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates is to be administered, two or more pharmaceutical compositions may be combined in the form of a kit suitable for sequential administration or co-administration of the compositions. Such a kit comprises two or more separate pharmaceutical compositions, at least one of which contains a PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugate described herein, and means for separately retaining the compositions, such as a container, divided bottle, or divided foil packet. In another embodiment, compositions comprising one or more of the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates described herein, in containers having labels that provide instructions for use of the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugates for patient selection and/or treatment are provided.
In one embodiment, sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active agent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients described above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Typically, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound or PSMA ligand-imaging conjugate into a sterile vehicle which contains a dispersion medium and any additional ingredients of those described above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof, or the ingredients may be sterile-filtered together.
The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.
Any effective regimen for administering PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be used. For example, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be administered as single doses, or the doses can be divided and administered as a multiple-dose daily regimen. Further, a staggered regimen, for example, one to five days per week can be used as an alternative to daily treatment, and for the purpose of the methods described herein, such intermittent or staggered daily regimen is considered to be equivalent to every day treatment and is contemplated. In one illustrative embodiment the patient is treated with multiple injections of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I to treat the cancer. In one embodiment, the patient is injected multiple times (preferably about 2 up to about 50 times) with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I, for example, at 12-72 hour intervals or at 48-72 hour intervals. Additional injections of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be administered to the patient at an interval of days or months after the initial injections(s) and the additional injections can prevent recurrence of the cancer.
Any suitable course of therapy with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be used. In one embodiment, individual doses and dosage regimens are selected to provide a total dose administered during a month of about 15 mg. In one illustrative example, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is administered in a single daily dose administered five days a week, in weeks 1, 2, and 3 of each 4 week cycle, with no dose administered in week 4. In an alternative example, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is administered in a single daily dose administered three days a week, of weeks 1, and 3 of each 4 week cycle, with no dose administered in weeks 2 and 4. In an alternative example, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is administered biweekly on weeks 1 and 2, i.e. on days 1, 4, 8, 11, of a 3-week cycle. In an alternative example, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is administered once weekly on weeks 1 and 2, i.e. days 1 and 8 of a 3-week cycle.
The unitary daily dosage of the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can vary significantly depending on the patient condition, the cancer being treated, the route of administration of the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I and tissue distribution, and the possibility of co-usage of other therapeutic treatments, such as radiation therapy or additional drugs in combination therapies.

In one aspect, a clinical benefit of the patient to treatment with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be characterized utilizing Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Illustratively, the criteria have been adapted from the original WHO Handbook (3), taking into account the measurement of the longest diameter for all target lesions: complete response, (CR)-the disappearance of all target lesions; partial response (PR)-at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter; stable disease (SD)-neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started; progressive disease (PD)-at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In another aspect overall disease response rate (ORR) is a clinical benefit and is calculated as the percent of patients who achieve a best response of CR or PR. Overall disease control rate (DCR) can be another clinical benefit and is calculated as the percent of patients who achieve a best response of CR, PR, or SD.
In one illustrative example overall survival is the time to death for a given patient defined as the number of days from the first day the patient received protocol treatment (C1D1) to the date of the patient's death. All events of death can be included, regardless of whether the event occurred while the patient was still taking the study drug or after the patient discontinued the study drug. If a patient has not died, then the data can be censored at the last study visit, or the last contact date, or the date the patient was last known to be alive, whichever is last.
Alternatively, a clinical benefit of the patient as a result of treatment with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I can be characterized as inhibition of tumor growth which can be identified in a patient through, for example, follow-up imaging of the patient's cancer after treatment with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I. For example, inhibition of tumor growth can be characterized by measuring the size of tumors in a patient after administration of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I according to any of the imaging techniques described herein, where the inhibition of tumor growth is indicated by a stable tumor size, or by a reduction in tumor size. It will be appreciated that the identification of inhibition of tumor growth can be accomplished using a variety of techniques, and is not limited to the imaging methods described herein (e.g CT, MRI, PET imaging, SPECT imaging or chest x-ray).
In one embodiment, a method is provided of determining whether PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is indicated for the treatment of a patient with cancer, the method comprising the step of determining the PSMA status in a patient with cancer wherein PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is indicated for the treatment of the patient if the PSMA status of the patient is positive.
In one embodiment, a method is provided of assessing whether PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is indicated for the treatment of a patient with one of the cancers described herein. The method comprises the steps of visually determining PSMA status in the patient wherein PSMA status is based on a imaging tumors that are PSMA positive in the patient, and wherein the PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I is indicated for the treatment of the patient when the PSMA status of the patient is positive.
In the above-described embodiments, if a patient is in the group with positive PSMA status, a clinical benefit of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I treatment is indicated. In one embodiment, the clinical benefit to the patient can be overall survival of the patient, ability to receive four or more cycles of therapy with PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I, inhibition of tumor growth, stable disease, a partial response of the patient to therapy, a complete response of the patient to therapy, disease control (i.e., the best result obtained is a complete response, a partial response, or stable disease), and/or overall disease response (i.e., the best result obtained is a complete response or a partial response). In one illustrative example, the clinical benefit for a patient being treated for pleural mesothelioma or adenocarcinoma (e.g. adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction) is stable disease.
In another embodiment, the methods described herein include the following examples. The examples further illustrate additional features of the various embodiments of the invention described herein.

3. Preparation of PSMA Imaging Conjugate IIIa
a. Preparation of PSMA Imaging Conjugate IIa Formulation
A 12 liter volume of Water For Injection (WFI) was sparged with nitrogen. Solutions of 1.0 M NaOH and 0.2 M HCl were prepared and sparged with nitrogen for pH adjustment of the formulation and for preparation of the stannous chloride stock solution. 2000 mL of deoxygenated WFI was added to a 5 L jacketed formulation vessel which was connected to a chiller. The chiller solution was set at 5° C. and circulation was maintained throughout the compounding and filtration process. 88.6 g of sodium gluconate and 1063 mg of EDTA disodium dihydrate were weighed and transferred to the formulation vessel and dissolved. A stannous chloride stock solution at a concentration of 10 mg/mL was made using the previously prepared 0.2 M HCl. A 35.4 mL aliquot of the stannous chloride stock solution was added to the formulation vessel and mixed well with stirring. 354.3 mg (net content) of Compound II was weighed and transferred into the formulation vessel. The mixture was stirred for at least 5 minutes and complete dissolution was observed. The pH was adjusted to 6.8±0.2 with deoxygenated 1.0 M NaOH solution and 0.2 N HCl solution. Deoxygenated WFI was then added until a formulation weight of 3578 g (3543 mL) was achieved. The formulation solution was stirred for five minutes and then sterile filtered through a 0.22 μm filter into a receiving vessel. Vials were filled with 1.01 g±0.03 g (1.00 mL) solution per vial. The vials were loaded into the lyophilizer. Inert atmosphere via a nitrogen blanket was maintained throughout formulation and vialing. Upon completion of the lyophilization cycle, vials were backfilled with nitrogen to approximately 646,000 mTorr. The vials were stoppered and removed from the lyophilizer, crimped with aluminum seals and labeled. Vials were placed in boxes and were stored at 5±3° C.
b. Room Temperature Labeling of Compound II with 99mTc to Provide Preparation of PSMA Imaging Conjugate IIIa
A PSMA imaging conjugate IIa kit vial was removed from the refrigerator and allowed to warm to room temperature (17-27° C.) for 15-30 min. The vial was put into a suitable radioactive shielding container. One to Two milliliter (≦50 mCi) of 99mTc pertechnetate injection was added to the vial using a lead shielded syringe. Before removing the syringe from the vial, equal volume of headspace was withdrawn in order to normalize the pressure inside the vial. The vial was gently swirled to completely dissolve the powder and then allowed to stand at ambient temperature (17-27° C.) for 15 minutes. 5-6 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride injection, USP, was then added to the vial. The labeled solution was stored at room temperature (17-27° C.) and used within 6 hours of preparation.
4. Clinical Biological Examples
a. Study Design
This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation oncology study in which EC1169 was dosed three times weekly (TIW), on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule or once weekly dosing (QW) on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule to assess toxicity, safety and preliminary efficacy results in patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and have been previously treated with a taxane except in cases of contraindication (e.g. poor performance status, age or personal choice). Patients were also dosed with 99mTc-EC0652 and underwent a SPECT/CT scan (or SPECT scan if no SPECT/CT is available) to evaluate EC0652 as an imaging agent to identify PSMA expression.
Prior dose escalation methodology for both schedules was based the continuous reassessment method (CRM), in which 1 patient is assigned to 1 dose level. Subsequent patients were to be enrolled upon the first observation of DLT, at which time enrollment to that dose level would be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients. An alternative dose escalation methodology for both schedules was based upon the standard “3+3” approach, in which a minimum of 3 patients is enrolled to a given dose level. Following the first observation of a DLT, the dose level is then expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.

Treatments & Regimens:
I. PSMA Imaging Agent Ma Administration and Imaging:
Patients received an injection of 0.1 mg of PSMA Imaging Agent IIa labeled with 20-25 mCi of technetium-99m (PSMA Imaging Agent Ma). Patients were subjected to SPECT/CT imaging of the region(s) known to contain target lesion(s) approximately 3-4 hours after injection of PSMA Imaging Agent Ma (99mTc-EC0652). For sites where SPECT/CT imaging is not available, SPECT imaging alone was carried out.
II. PSMA-Tubulysin Compound I Administration: PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I was administered at least 4 days after PSMA Imaging Agent Ma was administered, as an intravenous bolus injection, TIW on Weeks 1 and 2 (i.e., on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12 of a 3-week cycle) or once weekly on Weeks 1 and 2 of a 3-week schedule.
II. Schedule #1 TIW Dosing Dose Escalation:
The starting dose of EC1169 on Schedule 1 was 0.2 mg/m2 The table below outlines the dose levels for PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I for Schedule #1 TIW dosing, with up to 14 doses levels of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I planned. Should the MTD not be determined after escalation of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I to dose level 6, PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I may continue to be dose escalated in 25% increments.

IVA: DLT Definition for Both Schedules:
DLTs will be based on events occurring in Part A during the first cycle of therapy and the adverse events must be drug related (i.e. definitely, probably or possibly):≧Grade 4 hematological toxicity.Grade 3 neutropenia with fever>38.5° C. and/or infection requiring antibiotic or antifungal treatment.Grade 3 neutropenia persisting for >5 days.Grade 3 thrombocytopenia with clinically significant hemorrhage requiring platelet transfusion.≧Grade 3 non-hematological toxicity. Grade 3 laboratory abnormalities (e.g., K or Mg) that persist for less than 48 hours are not considered DLTs.Grade 3 nausea, vomiting lasting more than 72 hours.A delay of >2 weeks in the scheduled administration of Compound I due to drug-related toxicity.
IVB: Schedule Specific DLT's:
Schedule #1: TIW Dosing Schedule: Inability to administer at least 4 of the 6 scheduled doses of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I in a cycle due to drug-related toxicity.Schedule #2: Once Weekly Dosing Schedule: Inability to administer both scheduled doses of PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I in a cycle due to drug-related toxicity.
In the event that a patient drops out resulting in the lack of information about the DLT within the required observation period, the patient will be replaced by a new one, who will be enrolled at the exact same dose.
V. Route of Administration:
PSMA imaging conjugate IIIa and PSMA ligand-tubulysin compound I was administered via IV bolus injection.
Results:
PSMA-imaging conjugate IIIa (99mTc-EC0652) showed good uptake in tumor lesions (See FIGS. 1A and 1B).
Twenty-one patients were evaluated for cycle 1 toxicity (Schedule #1: 5 pts; Schedule 42: 16 pts). All patients were Caucasian. The median age was 69.0 (range: 53-82). The median time on the study was 6.7 weeks (range: 0.1-33.1). The median number (range) of administered EC1169 cycles was 4 (3-4) for Schedule #1 patients, and 2 (1-12) for Schedule #2 patients. 9 of 21 pts had drug-related (DR) adverse events (AE's). No DRAE occurred in >1 Schedule #1 patient, Vomiting and fatigue were the only DRAE's reported in ≧2 Schedule #2 patients. There were no on-study deaths, DR Grade 3-4 toxicity or serious adverse events, or occurrences of dose limiting toxicity. 3 patients demonstrated stable disease lasting more than 4 cycles. No patient demonstrated a 50% decrease in PSA. Dose proportionate increases in both Cmax and AUC for EC1169 were observed. Both EC1169 and 99mTc-EC0652 were well tolerated in mCRPC patients.
