T1	REACTION_SPAN 71370 72002	2-Chloro-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-4-pyrimidineamine (0.514 g, 1.85 mmol), 3-(aminosulfonyl)-4-methylaniline (0.689 g, 3.70 mmol, made by reduction of commercially available 2-methyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonamide or synthesized as described below), and trifluoroacetic acid (0.186 mL, 2.41 mmol) were combined with iPrOH (6.0 mL) in a sealed vial and heated at 100Â°C for 3h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with IN HCl (80 mL). N2-(3-Aminosulfonyl-4-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine (I) was isolated as a white solid by suction filtration (0.703 g).
T2	REACTION_SPAN 72300 72409;72410 73169	II: 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine N2-(3-Aminosulfonyl-4-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, I, (0.200 g, 0.467 mmol), DMAP (40 mg, 0.33 mmol)) and triethylamine (0.118 mL, 0.847 mmol) were stirred in THF (6.0 mL). Propionic anhydride (0.180 mL, 1.40 mmol) was added to the solution drop wise. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and washed with water (5 x 25 mL) and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated. The residue was suspended in ethyl acetate (25 mL), sonicated and the solid collected by filtration to give 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, II, (0.20 g).
T3	REACTION_SPAN 73555 73682;73683 74090	III: 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine mono-sodium salt 5-Fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, II, (0.125 g, 0.258 mmol) was suspended in acetonitrile (1.5 mL) and water (1.5 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. A solution of IN NaOH aq. (0.260 mL) was added drop wise. The reaction mixture was stirred until it became clear, filtered through glass wool, and lyophilized to give the sodium salt of II.
T4	REACTION_SPAN 74403 74530	IV: 5-Fluoro-N2-[4-methyl-3-(N-propionylaminosulfonyl)phenyl]-N4-[4-(2-propynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine Potassium Salt
