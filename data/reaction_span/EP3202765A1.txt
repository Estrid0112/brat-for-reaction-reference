Background Art
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a member of receptor tyrosine kinase family, which can recruit downstream protein by autophosphorylation, and further modulate cell metabolism and growth by expression of a specific gene. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase was first found in Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and was also found later to be expressed in a high level in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
The abnormal expression of ALK in some ALCL/NSCLC was resulted from different chromosomal translocations. These chromosomal translocations may result in the production of the corresponding fusion proteins. The analysis of these fusion genes shows that they all comprise a 3' terminal gene sequence of ALK gene, which encodes an intracellular kinase domain; and the gene fragments fused to ALK all comprise a promoter element and encode a sequence that mediates self-dimerization, thus resulting in high expression and over-activation of the fusion protein having ALK kinase activity, and causing malignant transformation of cell. Therefore, the activity of intracellular kinase domain of ALK and the corresponding signal transduction pathway are the important molecular mechanism responsible for the development of ALCL. In addition to ALK, ROS1 is another hot target gene studied in lung adenocarcinoma. ROS1 is a member of receptor tyrosine kinase family. ROS1 is responsible for an incidence rate of about 1.7% for NSCLC. ROS1and Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have a homology of 49% in kinase domain, and have an identity of 77% in ATP-binding site, which makes the treatment of NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement by using ALK kinase inhibitor possible.
Therefore, the development of small molecular inhibitors against ALK/ROS1may effectively reduce the effect of the mutated ALK/ROS1 gene on downstream proteins, thereby influencing invasion and proliferation of tumor cells, and the like, and finally influencing the growth of tumor cells and exerting anti-tumor effect. Crizotinib developed by Pfizer has come into the market successfully now, and has been widely accepted as it has good therapeutic effectagainstEML4-ALK mutated non-small cell lung cancer. With the appearance of Crizotinib on the market, specific diagnostic kits have also come into market. Before the application of a medicament, a patient is diagnosed by a kit to determine whether he or she has ALK mutation. For specific patients, ALK inhibitors exhibit good inhibitory activity. The research on Crizotinib against ROS1 has been in the clinic stage, and achieved a breakthrough role in pharmacotherapy. However, there are a lot of clinical trials showing that patients having ALK fusion generally exhibit resistance to Crizotinib after 1-2 years treatment. The mechanism underlying the generation of resistance to Crizotinib is very complex, wherein ALK mutation is responsible for about 1/3 of resistance cases, and the mutation sites mainly include L1196M, C1156Y, F1174L, etc. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to design and screen the second generation ALK inhibitors having good therapeutic effect in patients resistant to Crizotinib.
The second generation ALK inhibitors, which have come into the market now, include Ceritinib from Novartis, and Alectinib from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. under Roche; and the ALK inhibitors in clinical stage include AZD-3463, AP26113, etc.<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img><img> id-imgb0002.tif </img><img> id-imgb0003.tif </img><img> id-imgb0004.tif </img>
Therefore, it is of great significance for the treatment of diseases caused by ALK mutation in clinic to look for new small molecular compounds having excellent inhibitory activity against ALK fusion and drug resistant mutations by modifying a compound structure, make great efforts to improve physico-chemical properties of compounds, and enhance druggability, such as bioavailability of compounds.

After column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate=1:1), the final product(70 mg, yield: 56%) was obtained.Molecular formula: C28H32ClN5O3S Molecular weight: 554.11 LC-MS (M/e): 554.0[M+H]+1H-NMR (400 MHz, MeOD) δ: 8.47 (d, 1H, J = 8.0Hz), 8.09 (s, 1H), 7.88 (dd, 1H, J1 = 8.0Hz, J2 =1.6 Hz), 7.70 (s,1 H), 7.67 (m, 1 H), 7.33 (t, 1 H, J = 7.2Hz), 6.07-6.09 (m, 1H), 5.53-5.56 (m, 1H), 4.17 (t, 2H, J = 4.8Hz), 3.79(d, 2H, J = 2.4Hz), 3.41 (t, 1 H, J = 6.0Hz), 3.27-3.29 (m,2H), 2.73-2.77 (m,1H), 2.57-2.60 (m,1H), 2.41 (s,2H), 2.04(s,3H), 1.92-1.98(m,2H), 1.25(d, 6H, J = 10.4Hz).
The above examples are only the exemplified embodiments of the invention, and are not used to limit the protection scope of the invention. The protection scope of the invention is defined by the attached claims.
The present application claims a right of priority on the basis of the previous Chinese patent application No. 201410515596.9 as filed on Sep. 29, 2014, the full text of which is incorporated herein as a part of the present application.
