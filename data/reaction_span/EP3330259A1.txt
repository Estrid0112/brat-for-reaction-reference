[Background Art]
Post-translational modifications such as acetylation are very crucial regulatory modules at the heart of biological processes in the cells and are tightly regulated by a multitude of enzymes. Histones are the chief protein components of chromatin and act as spools around which DNA strands to assist in DNA condensation. Also, the balance of histone acetylation and deacetylation is a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from lysine residues on histone proteins of chromatin, and are known to be associated with gene silencing and induce cell cycle arrest, angiogenic inhibition, immune regulation, cell death, etc. (Hassig et al., Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997, 1, 300-308). In addition, it was reported that the inhibition of enzymatic function of HDACs induces the apoptosis of cancer cells in vivo by reducing the activity of cancer cell survival-associated factors and activating cancer cell apoptosis-associated factors (Warrell et al, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998, 90, 1621-1625).
In humans, 18 HDACs have been identified and are subdivided into four classes based on their homology to yeast HDACs. Among them, 11 HDACs use zinc as a cofactor and can be divided into three groups: Class I (HDAC1, 2, 3 and 8), Class II (IIa: HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9; IIb: HDAC6 and 10), Class IV (HDAC 11). Additionally, 7 HDACs of Class III (SIRT 1-7) require NAD+ instead of zinc as a cofactor (Bolden et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006, 5(9), 769-784).
Various HDAC inhibitors are in preclinical or clinical development, but to date, only non-selective HDAC inhibitors have been identified as anticancer agents, and only vorinostat (SAHA) and romidepsin (FK228) have been approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and panobinostat(LBH-589) have been approved for the treatment of multiple meyeloma. However, non-selective HDAC inhibitors are known to cause side effects such as fatigue and nausea, generally at high doses (Piekarz et al., Pharmaceuticals 2010, 3, 2751-2767). Such side effects have been reported to be due to the inhibition of class I HDACs. Due to such side effects, the use of non-selective HDAC inhibitors in the development of drugs other than anticancer drugs has been limited (Witt et al., Cancer Letters, 2009, 277, 8-21).
Meanwhile, it was reported that the selective inhibition of class II HDACs would not show toxicity shown in the inhibition of class I HDACs. Also, when selective HDAC inhibitors are developed, side effects such as toxicity, which are caused by the non-selective HDAC inhibition, can be overcome. Thus, selective HDAC inhibitors have potential to be developed as therapeutic agents effective for the treatment of various diseases (Matthias et al., Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008, 28, 1688-1701).
It is known that HDAC6, a member of Class IIb HDACs, is present mainly in the cytoplasm and is involved in the deacetylation of a number of non-histone substrates (HSP90, cortactin, etc.), including tubulin (Yao et al., Mol. Cell 2005, 18, 601-607). HDAC6 has two catalytic domains, and the zinc finger domain of C-terminal can bind to ubiquitinated proteins. It is known that HDAC6 has a number of non-histone proteins as substrates, and thus plays an important role in various diseases, including cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders (Santo et al., Blood 2012 119: 2579-258; Vishwakarma et al., International Immunopharmacology 2013, 16, 72-78; Hu et al., J. Neurol. Sci. 2011, 304, 1-8).
The common structural characteristic of various HDAC inhibitors is a structure consisting of a cap group, a linker and a zinc-binding group (ZBG), as shown in the following Vorinostat structure. Many researchers have conducted studies on enzyme inhibitory activity and selectivity by structurally modifying the cap group and the linker. Among these groups, the zinc-binding group is known to play a more important role in enzyme inhibitory activity and selectivity (Wiest et al., J. Org. Chem. 2013 78: 5051-5065;Methot et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008, 18, 973-978).<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>
The zinc-binding group is generally a hydroxamic acid or benzamide derivative. Herein, the hydroxamic acid derivative exhibits a potent HDAC inhibitory effect, but has problems of low bioavailability and severe off-target activity. In addition, the benzamide derivative has a problem in that it can produce toxic metabolites in vivo, because it contains aniline (Woster et al., Med. Chem. Commun. 2015, online publication).
Accordingly, there is a need for the development of selective HDAC 6 inhibitors for treatment of diseases such as cancer, inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, which have a zinc-binding group with improved bioavailability and, at the same time, cause no side effects, unlike non-selective inhibitors that cause side effects.

Reaction scheme 1 above shows a method for synthesis of compounds having an amide structure. As shown in reaction scheme 1, a compound of formula 1-1 is subjected to reductive amination with an amine compound, or a compound of formula 1-2 is subjected to a substitution reaction with an amine compound, thereby preparing a compound of formula 1-3. The compound of formula 1-3 is reacted with an acyl chloride of formula 1-4 to synthesize a compound of formula 1-5, which is then reacted with hydrazine, thereby preparing a compound of formula 1-6. The compound of formula 1-6 is reacted with trifluoroacetic anhydride or difluoroacetic anhydride to produce a compound of formula 1-7. When a compound of formula 1-8 in which an oxadiazole ring is not formed is obtained, it is reacted with 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent) to obtain a compound of formula 1-8.

Reaction scheme 2 above shows a method for synthesis of compounds having a heterocycloalkyl amide structure. As shown in reaction scheme 2, a compound of formula 2-1 is reacted with an amine compound to synthesize a compound of formula 2-2, which is then subjected to a substitution reaction, thereby synthesizing a compound of formula 2-3. The compound of formula 2-3 is reacted with hydrazine to produce a compound of formula 2-4.

Measurement of Activity of the Compounds of the Present Invention and Analysis Protocol
Experimental Example 1: HDAC enzyme activity inhibition assays (in vitro)
In order to examine the HDAC6 selectivity of the compounds of formula I of the present invention by HDAC1 and HDAC6 enzymatic activity inhibition assays, an experiment was performed using a conventional substance as a control.
HDAC enzyme activity was measured using a HDAC Fluorimetric Drug Discovery Kit (BML-AK511, 516) from Enzo Life Science. For the HDAC1 enzyme activity test, human recombinant HDAC1 (BML-SE456) was used as an enzyme source, and Fluor de Lysⓡ-"SIRT1 (BNL-KI177) was used as a substrate. A 5-fold dilution of the compound was seeded into a 96-well plate, and then 0.3 µg of the enzyme and 10 µM of the substrate were added to each well of the plate and allowed to react at 30°C for 60 minutes. Then, Fluor de Lysⓡ-Developer II (BML-KI176) was added thereto and allowed to react for 30 minutes, after which the fluorescence value (Ex 360, Em 460) was measured using a multi-plate reader (Flexstation 3, Molecular Device). The HDAC6 enzyme was tested using human recombinant HDAC6 (382180) from Calbiochem, according to the same protocol as the HDAC1 enzyme activity test method. Based on the resulting values, each IC50 value was calculated using GraphPad Prism4.0 program.

As can be seen in Table 2 above, the 1,3,4-oxadiazole amide derivative compounds, stereoisomers thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof according to the present invention showed about 36 to about 3846 times higher selective HDAC6 inhibitory activities in the HDAC1 and HDAC6 activity inhibition assays.
Experimental Example 2: Analysis of the Effect of HDAC6-Specific Inhibitors on Mitochondrial Axonal Transport (in vitro)
The effect of HDAC6-specific inhibitors on mitochondrial axonal transport was analyzed. Specifically, in order to examine whether the compounds represented by formula I according to the present invention selectively inhibit HDAC6 activity to increase the acetylation of tubulin, which is a major substrate of HDAC6, thereby improving the mitochondrial axonal transport velocity reduced by amyloid-beta treatment in neuronal axons, a comparison experiment was performed using a compound that have already been developed as a control.
Hippocampal neurons from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat embryos at embryonic day 17-18 (E17-18) were cultured in an extracellular matrix-coated dish for imaging for 7 days, and then treated with 1 µM of an amyloid-beta peptides. After 24 hours, the neurons were treated with compounds on the 8th days in vitro and 3 hours later, treated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Life Technologies, NY, USA) for the last 5 minutes to stain the mitochondria. Axonal transport of the stained mitochondria was imaged using a confocal microscope (Leica SP8; Leica Microsystems, UK) at 1-second intervals for 1 minute, and the transport velocity per second of each mitochondrion was determined using the IMARIS analysis software (BITPLANE, Zurich, Switzerland).
As a result, it was found that the 1,3,4-oxadiazole amide derivative compounds, stereoisomers thereof or pharmaceutically acceptable salts according to the present invention improved the velocity of mitochondrial axonal transport.
