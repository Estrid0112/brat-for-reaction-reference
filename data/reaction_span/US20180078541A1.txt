which acts as a modulator of FPR2 and can be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders which are at least partially mediated by FPR2.
FPR2 (alias lipoxin A4 receptor, FPRL1, LXA4R, ALXR) is a G-protein coupled receptor family member that has been shown to mediate calcium mobilization in response to the eicosanoid family member lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and its analogues (Maddox et al., J. Biol. Chem., 1997, 272, 6972-6978). The receptor is widely expressed and has been shown to bind to a large number of different ligands, including endogenous proteins (serum amyloid A) bacterial products (the formyl peptide N-formyl-methionine-leucyl-phenylalanine), other lipid-derivatives (resolvin D1 (RvD1) and its analogues) and peptides, including neuropeptides (Aβ42) and HIV (gp41 and gp120-derived peptides), amongst many others (Chiang et al., Pharmacol. Rev., 2006, 58, 463-487; Fredman and Serhan, Biochem. J., 2011, 437, 185-197; Migeotte et al., Cytokine Growth Factor Rev., 2006, 17, 501-519).
Wide ranging anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects of FPR2 ligands have been shown in pre-clinical models. For example, in vivo activities for LXA4, or derivatives, or stable analogues, and RvD1, or derivatives, or stable analogues have been demonstrated in arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) colitis, corneal injury, cystic fibrosis, dermal inflammation, fibrosis of the lung and kidney, glomerulonephritis, graft versus host disease (GvHD), inflammatory pain, ischemia/reperfusion injury, periodontitis, peritonitis, post-operative pain, pancreatitis, retinopathy and sepsis (Fredman and Serhan, Biochem. J., 2011, 437, 185-197; Romano et al., Eur J Pharmacol. 2015, 760, 49-63; Yatomi et al., Physiol. Rep., 2015, 3, pii, e12628). It has been demonstrated that the FPR2 agonist 17-R-RvD1 is able to reduce the severity of arthritis in the K/BxN serum transfer model of arthritis (Norling et al., JCI Insight, 2016, 1, e85922) and the stable agonist BML-111 has similar actions in the collagen-induced arthritis model (Zhang et al., Inflamm. Res., 2008, 57, 157-162). The potential use of FPR2 modulators in lung diseases has been well documented. In terms of asthma, it has been demonstrated that the addition of LXA4 or RvD1, or their stable analogues, are able to improve asthmatic symptoms in animal models (Barnig et al., Sci. Transl. Med., 2013, 5, 174ra26; Levy et al., Nat Med. 2002, 8, 1018-23). It has also been demonstrated that in severe asthma patients there are reduced levels of LXA4 (Celik et al., Clin Exp Allergy, 2007, 37, 1494-1501). Similar reductions in pulmonary LXA4 levels were seen in patients with COPD (Vachier I et al., J. Allergy Clin. Immunol., 2005, 115, 55-60) and cystic fibrosis (Karp et al., Nat. Immunol. 2004, 5, 388-392). RvD1 attenuated smoking-induced emphysema in vivo (Kim et al., Int. J. Chron. Obstruct. Pulmon. Dis., 2016, 11 1119-1128) and 17-R-RvD1 attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by inhibiting neutrophilic inflammation and promoting pulmonary restoration (Yatomi et al., Physiol. Rep., 2015, 3, pii, e12628).
In addition to anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution effects of FPR2-ligands, they have also been demonstrated to have effects on pain mechanisms. LXA4 has been directly shown to alleviate hyperalgesia and bone-cancer-related pain in animal models (Fredman and Serhan, Biochem. J., 2011, 437, 185-197; Hu et al., J. Neuroinflammation. 2012, 9, 278). Furthermore, the FPR2 agonist RvD1 has been shown to reduce inflammatory pain, spontaneous pain and post-operative pain and post-surgical pain (Ji et al., Trends Neurosci. 2011, 34, 599-609).
The biological properties of FPR2 agonists include, but are not limited to, regulation of inflammation, regulation of hyperalgesia, regulation of proinflammatory mediator production and/or release, regulation of migration and activation of monocytes/macrophages/microglia/astrocytes/dendritic cells and neutrophils, regulation of lymphocyte activation, regulate innalte lymphoid cell activation, proliferation and differentiation, regulation of cytokine production and/or release, regulation of immune reactions, regulation of phagocytosis/efferocytosis, regulation of apoptosis. Further, FPR2 is believed to be involved in the modulation of immune responses, such as those elicited through Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD).
Compounds which are active as modulators of FPR2 are also known from WO 2015/079692.
It was an object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which are modulators, preferably activators of FPR2, and which preferably have advantages over the compounds of the prior art. The novel compounds should in particular be suitable for use in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders or diseases which are at least partially mediated by FPR2.
This object has been achieved by the subject-matter of the patent claims.
It was surprisingly found that the compounds according to the present invention are highly potent modulators of the FPR2 receptor.

According to the present invention, the term “5- to 6-membered heteroaryl” preferably means a 5 or 6-membered cyclic aromatic residue containing at least 1, if appropriate also 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatoms, wherein the heteroatoms are each selected independently of one another from the group S, N and O and the heteroaryl residue can be unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted, if not indicated otherwise. In the case of substitution on the heteroaryl, the substituents can be the same or different and be in any desired and possible position of the heteroaryl. The binding to the superordinate general structure can be carried out via any desired and possible ring member of the heteroaryl residue if not indicated otherwise. Preferably, the 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl is bound to the suprordinate general structure via a carbon atom of the heterocycle. The heteroaryl can also be part of a bi- or polycyclic system having up to 14 ring members, wherein the ring system can be formed with further saturated or (partially) unsaturated cycloalkyl or heterocycloalkyl, aromatic or heteroaromatic ring systems, which can in turn be unsubstituted or mono- or disubstituted, if not indicated otherwise. In a preferred embodiment, the 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl is part of a bi- or polycyclic, preferably bicyclic, system. In another preferred embodiment, the 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl is not part of a bi- or polycyclic system. Preferably, the 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl is selected from the group consisting of pyridyl (i.e. 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl), pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrazinyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, furanyl, thienyl (thiophenyl), triazolyl, thiadiazolyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-indazolyl, 2,4,5,6-tetrahydrocyclopenta[c]pyrazolyl, benzofuranyl, benzoimidazolyl, benzothienyl, benzothiadiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzooxazolyl, benzooxadiazolyl, quinazolinyl, quinoxalinyl, carbazolyl, quinolinyl, dibenzofuranyl, dibenzothienyl, imidazothiazolyl, indazolyl, indolizinyl, indolyl, isoquinolinyl, naphthyridinyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, phenazinyl, phenothiazinyl, phthalazinyl, purinyl, phenazinyl, tetrazolyl and triazinyl. Particularly preferred 5- to 6-membered heteroaryl are selected from the group consisting of pyridyl (i.e. 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl), pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, thienyl (thiophenyl), oxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl and benzothienyl.
In connection with the terms “C1-6-alkyl”, “C1-4-alkyl”, “C3-6-cycloalkyl”, “3 to 6-membered heterocycloalkyl” and “C1-6-alkylene”, the term “substituted” refers in the sense of the present invention, with respect to the corresponding residues or groups, to the single substitution (monosubstitution) or multiple substitution (polysubstitution), e.g. disubstitution or trisubstitution; more preferably to monosubstitution or disubstitution;
of one or more hydrogen atoms each independently of one another by at least one substituent. In case of a multiple substitution, i.e. in case of polysubstituted residues, such as di- or trisubstituted residues, these residues may be polysubstituted either on different or on the same atoms, for example trisubstituted on the same carbon atom, as in the case of CF3, CH2CF3 or disubstituted as in the case of 1,1-difluorocyclohexyl, or at various points, as in the case of CH(OH)-CH═CH-CHCl2 or 1-chloro-3-fluorocyclohexyl. The multiple substitution can be carried out using the same or using different substituents.
In relation to the terms “phenyl”, “aryl” and “5- to 6-membered heteroaryl”, the term “substituted” refers in the sense of this invention to the single substitution (monosubstitution) or disubstitution, of one or two hydrogen atoms each independently of one another by at least one substituent. The disubstitution can be carried out using the same or using different substituents.
If a residue occurs multiply within a molecule, then this residue can have respectively different meanings for various substituents: if, for example, both R2 and R4 denote C1-6-alkyl, then C1-6-alkyl can e.g. represent ethyl for R2 and can represent methyl for R4.

After washing, the cells are plated at 10,000 cells per well in 40 μL complete medium in a 384-well sterile clear bottom black plate and incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 18 hours. Plating media is removed from each well by decanting and gentle tapping before 30 μL of 0.5× Calcium 5 dye solution (0.5×FLIPR Calcium 5 dye (Molecular devices, R8186)); HBSS; 20 mM HEPES; 2.5 mM Probenecid; 0.025% Pluronic F-127; pH adjusted to 7.4) is added to each well and the plate is then incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes. For the assay the plate is equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes before placing it in the FLIPR. Compounds are dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted over an 11 point half log (3.16 fold) dilution (2 mM to 20 nM). Compounds are then diluted 1:50 in assay buffer (HBSS; 20 mM HEPES; 2.5 mM Probenecid; 0.05% gelatin; 0.1% BSA; pH adjusted to 7.4) just before performing the assay. Compounds are finally added to the respective wells of the cell plate (final assay concentration 10 μM to 100 pM) using the FLIPR (e.g. FLIPR-Tetra, Molecular Devices) and fluorescence readings are captured for 5 minutes.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Different Urea Analogous (GP1)
<img> id-US20180078541A1-20180322-C00078.TIF </img>
To a stirred solution of intermediate F (1 eq) in benzene/THF (4:1) was added Et3N (2 eq) followed by DPPA (1.3 eq) at RT and the resulting mixture was allowed stir for 2 h at the same condition. Required amine Ar-NH2 (1.3 eq) was then added and the resulting mixture was again stirred for another 16 h at 70° C. Volatiles were then removed under reduced pressure to yield a reddish crude gum. It was then extracted with EtOAc (two times) and the combined organic phase was washed sequentially by water and brine. The organic phase was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to furnish the crude as yellowish gummy solid. It was then purified over 100-200 silica gel using DCM to 10% MeOH/DCM gradient to produce different urea derivatives as off white solid. Examples 52 to 58 were synthesized in analogy to GP1 (see Table 1 below).

General Procedure for N-alkylation Followed by Deprotection and Urea Formation (GP2)
<img> id-US20180078541A1-20180322-C00086.TIF </img>
Step1:
To the stirred solution of key intermediate like intermediate B, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, N or O (1 eq) in dry DMF (6.0 mL/mmol) were added NaH (60%) (1.0 eq) followed by the addition of corresponding ester or bromide (1.0 eq) and stirred the reaction mixture at RT for 16 h. After completion of the reaction, it was quenched with ice water and extracted with EtOAc. The organic layer was dried over anhyd. Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain crude product which was purified by silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography (20-25% EtOAc/Hexane) to afford corresponding N-alkylated desired compound.
Step2:
To the stirred solution of step1 product (N-alkylated intermediate B, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, N or O) (1 eq) in 1, 4-dioxane was added 4M HCl in 1,4-dioxane (2.0 mL/mmol) followed by stirring at RT for a period of 2 h. After completion of the reaction (monitor by TLC and LC MS), the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure to get the crude material which was purified by triturating with pentane and ether to get the corresponding HCl salt as off white solid.
Step3:
To a stirred solution of step2 product (corresponding HCl salt of amine derived from intermediate B, D, H, I, J, K, L, M, N or O) (1 eq) in DCM (10.0 mL/mmol) was added Et3N (5 eq) followed by the addition of 1-chloro-4-isocyanato-benzene (1 eq) stirring at RT for a period of 1 h. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with 5% MeOH in DCM and washed with ice-cold water and brine. The organic layer was dried over anhyd. Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain crude product which was purified by silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography (2% MeOH/DCM) to afford desired compound.
Examples 59 to 68, 91 and 92 were synthesized in analogy to GP2, whereas in case of Examples 67, 68, 91 and 92 step 1 of GP2 was omitted (see Table 2 below).

General Procedure for N-methylation Followed by Deprotection and Urea Formation (GP3)
<img> id-US20180078541A1-20180322-C00099.TIF </img>
Step1:
To a stirred solution of intermediate Q, R, S or T (1 eq) in ACN (5 mL/mmol) at ice cooled condition was added K2CO3 (3 eq) followed by the addition of MeI (1 eq) and the reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 16 h. After completion of the reaction, it was concentrated under reduced pressure, diluted with water and extracted with 5% MeOH in DCM; the combined organic layer was dried over anh. Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to get the crude product which was purified by silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography (2% MeOH/DCM) to afford desired N-methylated derivative of intermediate Q, R, S or T.
Step2:
To a stirred solution of step 1 product (N-methylated derivative of intermediate Q, R, S or T) (1 eq) in 1, 4-dioxane (4 mL/mmol) was added 4M HCl in dioxane (10 mL/mmol) followed by stirring at RT for a period of 2 h. After completion of the reaction (monitored by TLC and LC MS), the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure to get the crude material which was purified by triturating with pentane and ether to get the desired HCl salt of amine derived from intermediate Q, R, S or T.
Step3:
To a stirred of step2 product (HCl salt of amine derived from intermediate Q, R, S or T) (1 eq) in DCM (5 mL) was added Et3N (5.0 eq) followed by the addition of 4-chloro phenyl isocyanate (1 eq) stirring at RT for a period of 24 h. After completion of the reaction, it was diluted with DCM, given washed with water and brine. The combined organic layer was dried over anh. Na2SO4, filtered and Rota evaporated to get the crude product which was purified by silica gel (100-200 mesh) column chromatography to afford corresponding final compound.
Examples 87 to 90 were synthesized in analogy to GP3 (see Table 3 below).

Biological Activity of the Compounds According to the Invention:
Assay Method for Measuring Agonistic Activity of Compounds in hFPR1-Gα15-CHO and hFPR2-Aq-CHO Cell
Cryo-vial containing 6×106 cells (hFPR1-Gα15-CHO or hFPR2-Aq-CHO) was thawed in a 37° C. water bath. Cells were suspended in 10 ml of respective complete growth media (F12(1×) HAM media (Gibco; Cat#11765); 10% HI-FBS (Gibco; Cat#10082); 0.1 mg/ml Hygromycin B (Invitrogen; Cat#10687-010) [for hFPR1 only]; 0.2 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen; Cat#R25001) [for hFPR1 only]; 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (Gibco; Cat#10131) [for hFPR2-Aq only]; 0.25 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen; Cat#R25001) [for hFPR2-Aq only]) in a 15 ml centrifuge tube. The cell viability was checked with the help of Trypan Blue dye. Upon washing the cells, those were plated in a 384-well sterile clear bottom black plate (Greiner Bioone Cat#781091) so that, each well contained 10,000 cells in 40μl complete growth media. The plate was incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. for 18 hours.
Before assay on the next day, the cell plating media was removed from each well of the plate by decanting and gentle tapping. 30 μl, 0.11 of 0.5× Calcium 5 dye solution (0.5×FLIPR Calcium 5 dye (Molecular devices Cat# R8186); HBSS (Invitrogen; Cat#14025); 20 mM HEPES (Sigma; Cat#H0887); 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma; Cat#P8761); 0.025% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma; Cat#P2443); pH adjusted to 7.4) was added to each well. The plate was then incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes. Following which the plate was equilibrated at room temperature for 10 minutes before placing it in a 384 well FLIPR for assay. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and serially diluted following 11 point half log (3.16 fold) dilution with a starting concentration of 2 mM (Final assay concentration 10 μM). Aliquots of above mentioned each dilution was mixed with assay buffer (HBSS (Invitrogen; Cat#14025); 20 mM HEPES (Sigma; Cat#H0887); 2.5 mM Probenecid (Sigma; Cat#P8761); 0.05% gelatin (Sigma; Cat#G1890); 0.1% BSA (Sigma; Cat#A3059); pH adjusted to 7.4) just before performing the assay. Compounds were added to the respective wells of the assay ready cell plate with the help of the FLIPR (FLIPR Tetra) and fluorescence readings were captured for 5 minutes to measure any agonistic response of the compounds. The increase in fluorescence readings from the basal reading in presence of the compounds were compared with that of the control wells (wells having no compound) to calculate the agonistic activity of the compounds. The EC50 values of the compounds were determined using the Graph pad Prism software. The results are summarized in Table 4 below.
