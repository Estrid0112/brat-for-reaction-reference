FIELD OF THE INVENTION
This invention relates to unsymmetrically substituted benzothiadiazole-based molecular complexes.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Solar energy using photovoltaic effect requires active semiconducting materials to convert light into electricity. Currently, solar cells based on silicon are the dominating technology due to their high conversion efficiency. Recently, solar cells based on organic materials showed interesting features, especially on the potential of low cost in materials and processing. Judging from the recent success in organic light emitting diodes based on a reverse effect of photovoltaic effect, organic solar cells are very promising.
Organic photovoltaic cells have many potential advantages when compared to traditional silicon-based devices. Organic photovoltaic cells are light weight, economical in the materials used, and can be deposited on low cost substrates, such as flexible plastic foils. However, organic photovoltaic devices typically have relatively low power conversion efficiency (the ratio of incident photons to energy generated). This is, in part, thought to be due to the morphology of the active layer. The charge carriers generated must migrate to their respective electrodes before recombination or quenching occurs. The diffusion length of an exciton is typically much less than the optical absorption length, requiring a tradeoff between using a thick, and therefore resistive, cell with multiple or highly folded interfaces, or a thin cell with a low optical absorption efficiency.
Conjugated polymers are polymers containing π-electron conjugated units along the main chain. They can be used as active layer materials for some types of photo-electric devices, such as polymer light emitting devices, polymer solar cells, polymer field effect transistors, etc. As polymer solar cell materials, conjugated polymers should possess some properties, such as high charge carrier mobility, good harvest of sunlight, good processability, and proper molecular energy levels. Some conjugated polymers have proven to be good solar cell materials. Conjugated polymers are made of alternating single and double covalent bonds. The conjugated polymers have a δ-bond backbone of intersecting sp2 hybrid orbitals. The pz orbitals on the carbon atoms overlap with neighboring pz orbitals to provide π-bonds. The electrons that comprise the π-bonds are delocalized over the whole molecule. The semiconducting properties of the photovoltaic polymers are derived from their delocalized π bonds. The substituents of the polymers also largely influence the electronic properties. The optical bandgap, mobility and thin-film morphology are affected by both the type of functional group used as a substituent and the bulkiness and length of the side chain. Polymers which have only minor differences in the side chains will have large differences in the device performance.
There is a need in the art for polymer solar cells that exhibit increased power conversion efficiency and fill factor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Turning now to the detailed description of the preferred arrangement or arrangements of the present invention, it should be understood that the inventive features and concepts may be manifested in other arrangements and that the scope of the invention is not limited to the embodiments described or illustrated. The scope of the invention is intended only to be limited by the scope of the claims that follow.
“Alkyl,” as used herein, refers to an aliphatic hydrocarbon chains. In one embodiment the aliphatic hydrocarbon chains are of 1 to about 100 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 30 carbon atoms, and includes straight and branched chained, single, double and triple bonded carbons such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, neo-pentyl, n-hexyl, isohexyl, thenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, butadienyl, pentadienyl, hexadienyl, ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl, pentynyl, hexynyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 2-butyloctyl, 2-hexyldecyl, 2-octyldedodecyl, 2-decyltetradecy and the like. In this application alkyl groups can include the possibility of substituted and unsubstituted alkyl groups. Substituted alkyl groups can include one or more halogen substituents.
“Alkoxy,” as used herein, refers to the group R-O- where R is an alkyl group of 1 to 100 carbon atoms. Examples of alkoxy groups include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy (e.g., n-propoxy and isopropoxy), t-butoxy, pentoxyl, hexoxyl groups, and the like. In this application alkoxy groups can include the possibility of substituted and unsubstituted alkoxy groups.
“Alkylthio” as used herein refers to an -S- alkyl group. Examples of alkylthio groups include, but are not limited to, methylthio, ethylthio, propylthio (e.g., n-propylthio and isopropylthio), t-butylthio, pentylthio, hexylthio groups, and the like. In this application alkylthio groups can include the possibility of substituted and unsubstituted alkylthio groups.
“Aryl” as used herein, refers to an optionally substituted, mono-, di-, tri-, or other multicyclic aromatic ring system having from about 5 to about 50 carbon atoms (and all combinations and subcombinations of ranges and specific numbers of carbon atoms therein), with from about 6 to about 10 carbons being preferred. Non-limiting examples include, for example, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl, pentacenyl, cyclopentane, cyclohexane, imidazoline, pyran, benzodioxanyl, benzodioxolyl, chromanyl, indolinyl, and the like. Aryl groups can be optionally substituted with one or with one or more Rx. In this application aryl groups can include the possibility of substituted aryl groups (such as heteroaryls), bridged aryl groups and fused aryl groups.
Fill Factor (FF) as used herein, is the ratio (given as a percentage) of the actual maximum obtainable power, (Pm or Vmp*Jmp), to the theoretical (not actually obtainable) power, (Jsc*Voc). Accordingly, FF can be determined using the equation: FF=(Vmp*Jmp)/(Jsc*Voc) where Jmp and Vmp represent the current density and voltage at the maximum power point (Pm), respectively, this point being obtained by varying the resistance in the circuit until J*V is at its greatest value; and Jsc and Voc represent the short circuit current and the open circuit voltage, respectively. Fill factor is a key parameter in evaluating the performance of solar cells.
Open-circuit voltage (Voc) as used herein is the difference in the electrical potentials between the anode and the cathode of a device when there is no external load connected.
Power conversion efficiency as used herein, of a solar cell is the percentage of power converted from absorbed light to electrical energy. The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell can be calculated by dividing the maximum power point (Pm) by the input light irradiance (E, in W/m2) under standard test conditions and the surface area of the solar cell (Ac in m2). standard test conditions typically refers to a temperature of 25° C. and an irradiance of 1000 W/m2with an air mass 1.5 (AM 1.5G) spectrum.
The present application relates to polymeric compounds that can be used as organic semiconductor materials. The present compounds can have good solubility in various common solvents and good stability in air. When incorporated into optical or optoelectronic devices including, but not limited to, photovoltaic or solar cells, light emitting diodes, and light emitting transistors, the present compounds can confer various desirable performance properties. For example, when the present compounds are used in a photoactive layer of a solar cell (e.g., bulk heterojunction devices), the solar cell can exhibit very high power conversion efficiency (e.g., about 7.0% or greater) and very high fill factor (e.g., about 68% or greater).

The aryl group G can be selected from groups such as a benzodithiophenyl group, a silylene-bithiophenyl group, a carbazolyl group, and a dibenzosilole group, each of which can be optionally substituted as described herein. For example, the benzodithiophenyl group, the silylene-bithiophenyl group, the carbazolyl group, and the dibenzosilole group can be substituted with one, two, three or four solubilizing groups. Each solubilizing group can be a linear or branched aliphatic group (e.g., an alkyl group, an alkenyl group, an alkoxy group, or an alkylthio group) having 6-20 carbon atoms. In particular embodiments, each solubilizing group can be a branched C6-20 alkyl group or a branch C6-20 alkoxy group. Other examples of aryl groups such as polycyclic hetroaryl groups of G can include:

Photovoltaic devices for Examples 1-6 were created using the methodology of device fabrication below.
Device Fabrication
Zinc tin oxide (ZTO):phenyl-C60-butyric-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)acetamide (PCBNOH) sol-gel solutions were prepared by adding PCBNOH (1.7 mg, 2.4×10−3 mmol), zinc acetate dihydrate (330 mg, 1.5 mmol), and tin (II) acetate (33 mg, 0.14 mmol) to 2-methoxyethanol (10.6 mL) and ethanolamine (92 μL, 1.5 mmol). Solutions were stirred in air for a minimum of 8 h before use. ITO-coated glass substrates were washed with detergent (2×15 min), DI water (2×15 min), acetone (2×15 min), and isopropanol (2×15 min) in an ultrasonication bath. The substrates were placed in an oven at 80° C. for 2+ hours and placed in a UV-ozone cleaner for 1 min. After filtration with a 0.2 μm PVDF syringe filter, ZTO:PCBNOH sol-gel was spin-coated onto the top of the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was annealed at 210° C. in air for 15 min and taken into a glove box for deposition of the active layer. The photoactive layer solution was prepared by a 1:1.2 or 1:1.6 polymer:PCBM ratio at 14-27.5 mg/mL concentration with 1:1 ratio of chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. See Table I for solution and casting conditions for each polymer. The solution was mixed in a glove box and heated at 80° C. for 12 hours. Afterward, 2.5 or 3 vol % of 1,8-diiodooctane was added. The photoactive layer solution and ZTO:PCBNOH coated ITO substrates were heated at 110° C. for 30 min. Spin coating was performed with the photoactive layer solution, and substrates were heated to 110° C. 80 μL was pipetted onto the hot substrate and spin coated at 600 rpm or 1000 rpm for 40 s, followed immediately by 1200 rpm for 2 s (only for P-27 and P-29). The substrates were placed in a closed glass Petri dish for 18 hours to allow for solvent annealing. After solvent annealing, the substrates were scratched at the edge to expose the ITO layer for cathode electrical connection. The substrates were then placed in the metal evaporator, and 3.5 nm of MoOx and 120 nm of Ag were deposited. The deposition rate for the MoOx was 1.5-2.3 Å/s and Ag was 1.7-2.5 Å/s. The devices were encapsulated by using UV-curable epoxy and a cover glass slide and exposed to a UV cure for 3 min.
A comparison of the UV-vis spectra of Examples 1-5 with PCBM is shown in FIG. 19.

EXAMPLE 6
A 500 mL dry Schlenk flask was purged with argon before 3-dodecylthiophene (9.79 g, 0.039 mol) and N,N,N',N'-Tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) (4.96 g, 0.043 mol) were added. Anhydrous THF (150 mL) was injected and the resulting solution was cooled to −78° C. n-Butyl lithium (2.5 M in hexane, 15.511 mL, 0.039 mol) was added dropwise by syringe. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, and then heated to 60° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was again cooled to −78° C. and treated with a trimethyltin chloride solution (1.0 M in THF, 46.5 mL, 0.047 mol). The reaction was stirred overnight at room temperature. Water (100 mL) was poured into solution, the THF solvent was removed by rotary evaporator, and the aqueous layer was extracted with hexane (3×100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (2×) and MeOH (1×) and then dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated to afford the product (12.8 g, 79.5%) as a colorless liquid.
(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane (2.26 g, 5.4 mmol), 4-bromo-5-chloro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1.64 g, 4.95 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (0.18 g, 0.20 mmol), and P(o-tol)3 (0.24 g, 0.79 mmol) were combined in a 50 mL Schlenk flask. After the system was placed under vacuum and backfilled with argon three times, dry toluene (15 mL) was injected. The reaction was heated at 105° C. overnight, and then cooled to room temperature. The solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator, and the resulting residue was purified on a silica gel column with hexane/dichloromethane (v/v, 3/1) as the eluent. Recrystallization from a mixture of isopropanol and methanol produced an orange crystalline product (1.81 g, 72.7%).
5-chloro-4-(4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1.81 g, 3.60 mmol) was added to a 100 mL Schlenk flask, followed by anhydrous THF (60 mL). The solution was cooled to −78° C. before N-bromosuccinimide (1.34 g, 7.55 mmol) was added in portions. The reaction was gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was stopped by adding saturated potassium carbonate solution and then extracted with hexane. The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After the removal of solvent, the resulting mixture was subjected to column purification with hexane as the eluent. Red crystal (2.0 g, 81.7%) was obtained as product after recrystallization in isopropanol and drying in vacuo.
In a Schlenk flask, 4-(5-bromo-4-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-5-chlorobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (72.9 mg, 0.11 mmol), 4,8-Bis[(2-hexyldecyl)oxy]-2,6-bis(1,1,1-trimethylstannanyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene (110 mg, 0.11 mmol), P(o-to1)3 (5.4 mg, 0.018 mmol), and Pd2(dba)3 (2.6 mg, 2.9 μmol) were combined and degassed for 30 min. After refilling with argon, dry chlorobenzene (1.8 mL) was added. Two freeze-pump-thaw cycles were performed, and the reaction was heated to 120° C. for 24 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated in MeOH, and the crude polymer was purified by Soxhlet extraction, washing sequentially with acetone, hexanes, and chloroform. The polymer, Example 6 (85 mg, 81%), was recovered in the chloroform fraction. The polymer is depicted in FIG. 20.
Device Fabrication
The photoactive layer consisted of the donor polymer and acceptor PCBM at a ratio of 1:1.2, respectively. The total solution concentration ranged from 36 to 14 mg/mL in 1:1 o-dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene. The photoactive layer solution was stirred and heated at 80° C. overnight in a nitrogen filled glove box. The next day, 3 vol % of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added and the solution was heated on the hot plate at 80° C. for an hour. The solution was then filtered with a 2.7 μm glass fiber syringe filter.
Indium tin oxide (ITO) patterned glass substrates were cleaned by successive 15 min ultra-sonications in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The freshly cleaned substrates were left to dry overnight at 80° C. Preceding fabrication, the substrates were further cleaned for 1 min in a UV-ozone chamber and the electron transport layer, zinc tin oxide:fullerene, was immediately spin coated on top.
Single component or mixed metal oxide solutions were filtered directly onto ITO with a 0.25 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter and spin cast at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. Films were then annealed at 210° C. for 15 min, and directly transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box.
The photoactive layer was deposited from a 110° C. solution onto ITO/ZTO:PCBNOH substrates also at 110° C. The photoactive layer was spin cast at 600 rpm for 40 seconds and 1200 rpm for 2 seconds and directly transferred into a glass petri dish to solvent anneal for 18+ h. Some devices were thermally annealed on a hot plate after drying for 18+ h. After solvent annealing, the substrates were loaded into the vacuum evaporator where MoOx (hole transport layer) and Ag (anode) were sequentially deposited by thermal evaporation. Deposition occurred at a pressure of 1×10−6 torr. MoOx and Ag had thicknesses of 3.5 nm and 120 nm, respectively. The deposition rate for the MoOx was 0.6-1 Å/s and Ag was 1.5-2 Å/s. Samples were then encapsulated with glass using an epoxy binder and treated with UV light for 3 min.
Device Testing
Devices with an active area of 0.08306 cm2 were tested under AM 1.5G 100 mW/cm2 conditions with a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000 W solar simulator (4″×4″ illumination size). The current density-voltage curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The light intensity was calibrated with a crystalline silicon reference photovoltaic (area=0.4957 cm2) fitted with a KG-5 filter (calibrated by the Newport to minimize spectral mismatch.
