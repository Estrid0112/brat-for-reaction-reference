BACKGROUND
Natural product diptoindonesin (Dip) G 1 was isolated from tree barks of Hopea mengarawan in Indonesia together with nine other oligostilbenoids in 2009. (L. D. Juliawaty, Sahidin, E. H. Hakim, S. A. Achmad, Y. M. Syah, J. Latip and I. M. Said, Nat. Prod. Commun., 2009, 4, 947.) Around the same time, the same molecule was also isolated from Hopea chinensis stem barks in China. (H. M. Ge, W. H. Yang, Y. Shen, N. Jiang, Z. K. Guo, Q. Luo, Q. Xu, J. Ma and R. X. Tan, Chem. Eur. J., 2010, 16, 6338.) Dip G has a tetracyclic core with A-D rings bearing a ketone and three phenolic OH groups and an additional E-ring with one more phenolic OH group. Dip G showed anti-proliferation effect in murine leukemia P-388 cells (Juliawaty et al., supra) and immunosuppressant activity in a concanavalin A induced proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes (T cells) assay. (Ge et al., supra.) Recently, it was reported that Dip G could regulate the stability of estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ), two members of the steroid nuclear receptor superfamily with opposing effect on cell proliferation. (Z. Zhao, L. Wang, T. James, Y. Jung, I. Kim, R. Tan, F. M. Hoffmann and W. Xu, Chem. Biol., 2015, 22, 1608.) ERα promotes cell proliferation, while ERβ has an anti-proliferative effect in breast cancer cells. (A. M. S. Covaleda, H. Van den Berg, J. Vervoort, P. Van der Saag, A. Strom, J.-A. Gustafsson, I. Rietjens and A. J. Murk, Toxicol. Sci., 2008, 105, 303.) Interestingly, Dip G decreases the stability of the oncogenic ERα and increases the stability of ERβ, a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Instead of directly interacting with ERs, Dip G was found to target the E3 ubiquitin ligase C-terminus of HSC70-interacting protein (CHIP), also known as STIP1 homology and U-Box containing protein 1 (STUB1). (Zhao et al, supra.)
The only total synthesis of Dip G to date was reported by Kim and Kim in 2010, K. Kim and I. Kim, Org. Lett., 2010, 12, 5314.

A protecting group is any chemical moiety capable of selective addition to and removal from a reactive site to allow manipulation of a chemical entity at sites other than the reactive site. Many protecting groups are known in the art. A large number of protecting groups and corresponding chemical cleavage reactions are described in “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis,” Theodora W.

A “pharmaceutically suitable salt” is any acid or base addition salt whose counter-ions are non-toxic to a patient (including a veterinary patient) in pharmaceutical doses of the salts, so that the beneficial pharmacological effects inherent in the free base or free acid are not vitiated by side effects ascribable to the counter-ions. A host of pharmaceutically-suitable salts are well known in the art. For basic active ingredients, all acid addition salts are useful as sources of the free base form even if the particular salt, per se, is desired only as an intermediate product as, for example, when the salt is formed only for purposes of purification, and identification, or when it is used as intermediate in preparing a pharmaceutically-suitable salt by ion exchange procedures. Pharmaceutically-suitable salts include, without limitation, those derived from mineral acids and organic acids, explicitly including hydrohalides, e.g., hydrochlorides and hydrobromides, sulphates, phosphates, nitrates, sulphamates, acetates, citrates, lactates, tartrates, malonates, oxalates, salicylates, propionates, succinates, fumarates, maleates, methylene bis-b-hydroxynaphthoates, gentisates, isethionates, di-p-toluoyltartrates, methane sulphonates, ethanesulphonates, benzenesulphonates, p-toluenesulphonates, cyclohexylsulphamates, quinates, and the like.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed herein are novel, unnatural analogues of Dip G. These compounds are active for amelioriating, attenuating, and/or halting the growth and/or metastasis of breast cancers. The compounds have been shown to shrink breast cancer tumors in a murine model of human breast cancer.
The key features of the prior art Kim and Kim synthesis of Dip G include an elegant domino cyclization to construct both B and C rings from a diaryl ether and a Pd-catalyzed C-H arylation to install the E-ring in the penultimate step. For further biological studies of Dip G and its unnatural analogs, there remains an unmet need for a practical and flexible synthetic strategy for this class of compounds. Kim's group has reported that the treatment of 2 with excess BBr3 can lead to the formation of Dip G in high yield directly (Scheme 1). (Kim and Kim, supra.) Disclosed herein is a novel synthetic route in which intermediate 2 was derived from dibromobenzofuran 3 by sequential cross-coupling with two aryl boronic acids. A sequence of alkylation, cyclization, and dibromination converts resorcinol derivative 5 to dibromobenzofuran 3 via benzofuran 4.
<img> id-US20180065945A1-20180308-C00005.TIF </img>
Mono-protected resorcinol derivative 5 is commercially available. It can also be prepared conveniently from methyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate. The benzofuran core 4 was synthesized efficiently from 5 by the sequence of alkylation with bromodimethylacetal and cyclodehydration (Scheme 2) using Amberlyst-15. ((a) I. Kim, S.-H. Lee and S. Lee, Tetrahedron Lett., 2008, 49, 6579; b) I. Kim and J. Choi, Org. Biomol. Chem., 2009, 7, 2788; c) J. H. Lee, M. Kim and I. Kim, J. Org. Chem., 2014, 79, 6153.) The cyclization occurred regioselectively, which is consistent with similar reactions reported previously. Id.
<img> id-US20180065945A1-20180308-C00006.TIF </img>
Although there are a number of reports on dibromination of unsubstituted benzofurans (see (a) M. Hussain, N. T. Hung and P. Langer, Tetrahedron Lett., 2009, 50, 3929; (b) J. Chauhan, A. R. Monteil and S. E. Patterson, Heterocycl. Commun., 2010, 16, 241; (c) G. A. Salman, R. U. Nisa, V. O. Iaroshenko, J. Iqbal, K. Ayub and P. Langer, Org. Biomol. Chem., 2012, 10, 9464), it proved impossible to prepare 3 from 4 directly in reliable yields after screening various bromination reagents, solvents, bases, and temperature. See Scheme 3. The carboxylate ester substituent on the 4-position appeared to interfere with the second bromination. The cross-coupling occurred selectively on the 2-position of benzofuran 3. However, the yield of product 8 was low. Although the sequential Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction for dibromobenzofuran 3 was accomplished via literature methods ((a) N. T. Hung, M. Hussain, I. Malik, A. Villinger and P. Langer, Tetrahedron Lett., 2010, 51, 2420; (b) M. Hussain, N. T. Hung, N. Abbas, R. A. Khera, I. Malik, T. Patonay, N. Kelzhanova, Z. A. Abilov, A. Villinger and P. Langer, J. Heterocycl. Chem., 2015, 52, 497), the yield was not good for the first step.
During the course of optimizing the dibromination of benzofuran 4, it was found that mono-bromination occurred quickly. The second bromination was very slow, and decomposition of brominated products started to occur at high temperature. 2-Bromobenzofuran 9 was isolated in high yield as the only isomer when dichloroethane was used as the solvent and DMF as the catalyst. The direct bromination of benzofurans generally occurred on the more reactive 3-position. ((a) C. J. Hamilton, A. Saravanamuthu, A. H. Fairlamb and I. M. Eggleston, Bioorg. Med. Chem., 2003, 11, 3683; (b) M. Saitoh, J. Kunitomo, E. Kimura, H. Iwashita, Y. Uno, T. Onishi, N. Uchiyama, T. Kawamoto, T. Tanaka, C. D. Mol, D. R. Dougan, G. P. Textor, G. P. Snell, M. Takizawa, F. Itoh and M. Kori, J. Med. Chem., 2009, 52, 6270.) 2-Bromobenzofurans were prepared by lithiation and quenching with electrophilic bromination reagents. ((a) P. Sista, P. Huang, S. S. Gunathilake, M. P. Bhatt, R. S. Kularatne, M. C. Stefan and M. C. Biewer, J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym. Chem., 2012, 50, 4316; (b) L. Lu, H. Yan, P. Sun, Y. Zhu, H. Yang, D. Liu, G. Rong and J. Mao, Eur. J. Org. Chem., 2013, 2013, 1644.) The present inventors hypothesized that the carboxylate ester substituent on the 4-position deactivated the 3-position for bromination and this led to the formation of 2-bromobenzofuran only. Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of 2-bromobenzofuran 9 with 4-methoxyphenyl boronic acid occurred smoothly to afford product 10. 3-Bromobenzofuran 8 was obtained in high yield from 10 after stopping the reaction around 10 min. Longer reaction times led to lower yield of product 8. The second cross-coupling with 3,5-dimethoxyphenyl boronic acid occurred at higher temperature to yield penultimate intermediate 2. Natural product Dip G 1 was prepared from 2 by BBr3-mediated tandem cyclization and demethylation following literature procedure. See Kim and Kim, supra. Up to 0.4 g of Dip G precursor 2 was prepared using this synthetic route.

To examine the effect of the four phenolic OH groups on biological activity, Dip G analogs were prepared with just two or three phenolic OH groups as shown in Scheme 4. Replacing the para-methoxyphenyl boronic acid by phenyl boronic acid, analog 14 lacking the phenolic OH group in the E-ring of Dip G was prepared from bromobenzofuran 9 in four steps according to the sequence outlined in Scheme 3 for the preparation of 1 from 9. The bromination of 2-phenyl substituted benzofuran 11 proved to be more difficult than the bromination of substrates 4 or 10. Only trace amount of 3-bromobenzofuran 12 was obtained under the conditions shown in Scheme 3 for substrates 4 or 10. The yield could be improved to 50% by using DMF as the co-solvent. Analog 15, which lacks both phenolic OH groups in the D-ring, was
<img> id-US20180065945A1-20180308-C00008.TIF </img>
synthesized from intermediate 8 in just two steps. Friedel-Crafts cyclization worked smoothly for the formation of 15 after replacing the electron-rich dimethoxyphenyl group in Dip G 1 by a phenyl group in 15. Finally, compound 16, with just one methoxy group in the D-ring, was prepared from intermediate 8. Products 17 and 18 were formed and the acylation occurred preferentially on the less-hindered position of the D-ring.
The biological activity of these four analogs were then compared with the parent compound Dip G following our previous protocol (Zhao et al., supra). See FIGS. 1A, 1B, 1C, 2A, 2B, and 2C. Cells were treated with each compound at 10 μM concentration in order to evaluate how well each modified the stability of ERα and ERβ. In MCF7 cells, Dip G and all four analogs showed decreased ERα stability with the largest change occurring with Dip G and analogs 17 and 18. In Hs578T-ERβLuc Dox-inducible lines, ERβ was strongly stabilized by Dip G and compound 17. ERβ was moderately stabilized by compound 14. Interestingly, compounds 15 and 18 both destabilized ERβ, suggesting that the hydroxyl group para to the ketone in the D-ring of Dip G was critical for stabilizing ERβ. The hydroxyl group ortho to the ketone in the D-ring of Dip G is dispensable as the activity of compound 17 was slightly better than Dip G for destabilizing ERα and stabilizing ERβ3.
The compounds disclosed herein can also be fabricated via an alternative route, illustrated in Scheme 5:

To a stirred solution of nitrile A (61.3 mmol, 10.0 g) in CH2Cl2 (300 mL) were added Pd(OAc)2 (3.1 mmol, 688 mg) and NIS (73.6 mmol, 16.6 g). After being stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, the reaction mixture was quenched by NaHSO3 solution. Then the organic phase was wash by NaHCO3 solution (300 mL) twice. After drying by Na2SO4, the CH2Cl2 solution was concentrated to give a white solid B. The solid was directly used in the next step without further purification.

The anhydrous THF (300 mL), triethylamine (17 mL) and were sequentially added via syringe. The reaction was protected by argon and stirred at 60° C. overnight. Then the THF was removed and residue was dissolved by CH2Cl2 and washed consecutively with 2.0N HCl solution and brine, dried by Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to give light brown solid C, which was directly used in the next step without further purification.
The 1.0 L oven-dried flask was charged with light brown solid from last step, 12 (184 mmol, 46.7 g) and NaHCO3 (184 mmol, 15.5 g) and CH2Cl2 (250 mL). After being stirred at room temperature for 24 hours, 300 mL of water was added to the reaction mixture, NaHSO3 (20.0 g) was added slowly to quench the reaction. After removing the CH2Cl2, 300 mL of ethyl acetate was added to the mixture. The slurry was stirred overnight and filtrated, the filter cake was wash three time by ethyl acetate (30 mL). After drying by high vacuum, 19.0 gram of solid D was obtained. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 8.07 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 2H), 7.27 (d, J=2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.21 (d, J=2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.02 (d, J=8.9 Hz, 2H), 3.90 (s, 3H), 3.89 (s, 3H).
To a 250-mL flask was added compound D from last step (7.4 mmol, 3.0 g), Pd(OAc)2 (0.37 mmol, 83 mg), (3,5-dimethoxyphenyl) boronic acid (14.8 mmol, 2.7 g) and K2CO3 (29.6 mmol, 4.1 g). After mixture degassing three times and protecting by argon, DMF (74 mL) and H2O (3.7 mL) was added. Then the mixture was heated at 100° C. overnight. After removing DMF, the residue was dissolved in CH2Cl2, and washed by NaHCO3 solution twice, dried by Na2SO4, and concentrated. The light brown solid was directly used in the next step reaction without further purification.
To a 500-mL flask was added compound E from last step, NaOH (35 g) and ethylene glycol (350 mL). Then the mixture was heated at 175° C. for one hour. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted by 2N HCl (1.0 L), and extracted by CH2Cl2, and the organic phase was dried by Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was then purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2/Acetone), 1.9 gram of light yellow solid F was obtained. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.51 (d, J=8.9 Hz, 2H), 7.33 (d, J=2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.26 (d, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 6.82 (d, J=9.0 Hz, 2H), 6.51 (d, J=2.3 Hz, 2H), 6.45 (t, J=2.3 Hz, 1H), 3.93 (s, 3H), 3.80 (s, 3H), 3.72 (s, 6H).

After being stirred at room temperature for 24 h, the reaction mixture was quenched by ice water. The slurry was filtered, washed with water and CH2Cl2, and dried by high vacuum to give Diptoindonesin G (Dip G) 75 mg. 1H NMR (400 MHz, Acetone-d6) δ 14.17 (s, 1H), 9.58 (s, 1H), 9.19 (s, 1H), 9.13 (s, 1H), 7.83 (d, J=8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.53 (d, J=1.7 Hz, 1H), 7.34 (d, J=1.8 Hz, 1H), 7.25 (d, J=2.3 Hz, 1H), 7.11 (d, J=8.6 Hz, 2H), 6.37 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H).
In summary, disclosed herein is a practical synthetic strategy for the preparation of Dip G and its analogs. The biological evaluation of these new analogs revealed that not all four phenolic hydroxyl groups are required for anti-neoplastic activity.
Activity Against Endocrine-Resistant Breast Cancers:
The subject compounds are effective to inhibit the growth of endocrine-resistant breast cancers, as exemplified by MCF7 cells. Briefly, estrogen receptor ERα is expressed in over 70% of human breast cancers and is a major therapeutic target for endocrine therapy. Although many patients respond to the treatment, approximately 50% of responsive tumors relapse due to the development of resistance. An emerging mechanism of resistance is the development of “hot-spot” mutations in the ligand-binding domain of ESR1, the gene encoding ERα. The mutations lead to ligand-independent ERα activity that promotes tumor growth and metastasis, and reduced binding of ERα antagonists such as tamoxifen and selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) such as fulvestrant. Thus the current endocrine treatments are ineffective. As demonstrated herein, Dip G and its analogs significantly decrease ERα protein levels and is insensitive to ESR1 mutations. The compounds disclosed herein are thus effective to inhibit the growth of hormone-resistant breast cancers, including cancers with ESR1 mutations.
Although many patients benefit from Tam and AIs in adjuvant and metastatic settings, approximately 50% of responsive tumors eventually relapse due to the development of resistance. One emerging mechanism of resistance is the clonal evolution of mutations in a “hotspot” within the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ESR1, the gene encoding ERα. ESR1 mutations occur in 10-20% of patients with metastatic ERα-positive disease who had received endocrine therapies. The mutations lead to ligand-independent ERα activity that promotes cancer growth and metastasis, as well as reduced efficacy of ERα antagonists. The end result is a resistance to endocrine therapies.
To overcome endocrine resistance, one proposed method is to use selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). However, the one currently clinically available, SERD, “FASLODEX”®-brand fulvestrant (AstraZeneca, Cambridge, England), and others in development, only partially degrade ERα. Mutant ERα proteins are even more resistant to fulvestrant-induced degradation. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify a new class of ERα targeting drugs for the treatment of metastatic, ERα-expressing breast cancer.
Dip G promotes mutant ERα protein degradation more effectively than fulvestrant. As shown in FIG. 4, Dip G decreases endogenous ERα protein levels to less than 20% of. It also decreases ERα transcriptional activity in MCF7 cells. See FIG. 4. As shown in FIG. 4, when administered at a concentration of 10 μM, the amount of endogenous ERα in MCF7 cells is greatly decreased as compared to untreated cells. Importantly, using and T47D ERα Y537S stable cell lines, fulvestrant, Dip G and Dip G-D1 degraded wild type ERα proteins with similar efficacy. See FIG. 5. (T47D ERα WT is available from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Va.; accession no. HTB-133. The T47D ERα Y537S cell line is described in Wardell et al 2015) “Efficacy of SERD/SERM Hybrid-CDK4/6 Inhibitor Combinations in Models of Endocrine Therapy-Resistant Breast Cancer,” Clin Cancer Res. 21(22):5121-5130. Dip G and Dip G-D1 are more effective than 100 nM fulvestrant to degrade ERαY537S mutant protein. See FIG. 5. It is worthy to mention that the peak plasma concentration of fulvestrant in patients following the high dose administration of fulvestrant (500 mg) is ˜20 ng/ml (˜30 nM). McCormack, P. and Sapunar, F. (2008) “Pharmacokinetic profile of the fulvestrant loading dose regimen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer,” Clinical breast cancer 8:347-351. Pritchard, K. I., Rolski, J., Papai, Z., Mauriac, L., Cardoso, F., Chang, J., Panasci, L., lanuli, C., Kahan, Z., Fukase, K. et al. (2010) “Results of a phase II study comparing three dosing regimens of fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer (FINDER2),” Breast cancer research and treatment 123:453-461. The 100 nM of fulvestrant used in vitro is much higher the therapeutic dose in vivo. No obvious toxicity was observed in vivo for high concentrations of Dip G. (See below for further discussion.) This finding supports Dip G as a novel ERα degradation agent for mutant ERα in endocrine-resistant tumors.
Dip G inhibited growth of T47D xenograft tumor in vivo. Dip G was synthesized as described and formulated for the in vivo treatment. Dip G was prepared by dissolving the stock powder in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 50 mg/ml. This stock solution was then diluted 1:5 into a 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG300)/40% normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution to a final concentration of 20% Dip G solution. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Dip G was determined to be 50 mg/kg by oral and 20 mg/kg by retro-orbital injection in mouse models. To determine MTD, escalating doses of Dip G dissolved in the aforementioned formulation were injected retro-orbitally or by oral gavage daily, five days out of seven to determine the MTD. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Dip G, the 3P Lab at the University of Wisconsin Carbon Cancer Center developed a HPLC and LC/MS method for measuring the plasma concentrations of Dip G. Dip G was found to have half-life of 1 hour in mice. (Data not shown.) Dip G was intra-tumorally delivered to ERα-positive T47D xenografted mice three times a week and the tumors were monitored for three weeks. See FIG. 3. It was found that treatment with Dip G for 21 days strongly inhibited xenografted tumor growth as compared with vehicle-treated controls. Control-treated tumors were 70% of original size, while tumors (n=16) treated with Dip G were 46% of original size (FIG. 3). Under these treatment conditions, some Dip G-treated tumors completely regressed. Liver toxicity was undetectable using an aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”))ELISA assay (AST activity was around 70 milliunits/mL) and no gross tissue damages were observed in liver, lung, kidney, brain, and heart. (AST ELISAs are available commercially from several suppliers, including Abcam, Cambridge, Mass.)
Mechanistically, it was determined that Dip G does not directly bind to ERα; rather it binds to CHIP ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates the stability of ERα. This finding is important because this indirect mode of action distinguishes Dip G from other known ERα targeting agents that bind to ERα directly. Prior to this study, the in vivo anti-cancer effect of Dip G has never been investigated. Dip G is thus effective in overcoming endocrine resistance regardless of the basis (genetic or otherwise) of that resistance. Dip G and its analogues is therefore likely more effective and less toxic fulvestrant for treating metastatic breast cancers.
Additional experiments are currently being conducted to determine the toxico-kinetics and pre-clinical pharmacology of Dip G and Dip G-D1 (compound 17) in mice. We will examine if HPLC and LC/MS methods developed for measuring plasma concentrations of Dip G also measures Dip G-D1. Escalating doses of Dip G-D1 dissolved in PBS will be injected retro-orbitally daily, five days out of seven to determine the MTD. The body weight, as well as acute toxicities of the mice (female and male, n=3 each) will be monitored for up to one month to determine MTD of Dip GD1.
The MTD determined above will be administered IV retro-orbitally into mice. Blood will be withdrawn and the concentration of Dip G-D1 will be measured to determine the pharmacokinetics (half-life, area under the curve, Cmax, etc) of the compound in vivo. For toxico-kinetics study, we will administer low, mid, and high doses of Dip G and Dip G-D1 to male and female mice for 14 consecutive days. Clinical pathology observations including hematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis evaluations will be determined at the time of termination.
Finally, we will measure the concentration of Dip G or its analogue in tumors taken from MCF7 xenografts in athymic nude mice. Our lab has performed MCF7 xenografts previously; see Al-Dhaheri, M., Wu, J., Skliris, G. P., Li, J., Higashimato, K., Wang, Y., White, K. P., Lambert, P., Zhu, Y., Murphy, L. et al. (2011) “CARM1 is an important determinant of ERalpha-dependent breast cancer cell differentiation and proliferation in breast cancer cells,” Cancer research 71:2118-2128. Briefly, 5×106 MCF7 cells will be inoculated into the mammary fat pad of nude mice (n=5). 25 mg, 60-day slow releasing 17β-estradiol pellets (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Fla.) will be implanted into mice two days afterward. Animals will be monitored for palpable tumor formation. Usually after 4 weeks, MCF7 xenograft tumors reach 100-200 mm3. We will then administer Dip G or its analogue retro-orbitally or by oral gavage into mice and excise the tumors to analyze intratumoral concentration of the compound.
We will also assess the anti-cancer effect of Dip G in MCF7 derivative cell lines and xenograft mouse models. We will first compare the efficacy of Dip G and Dip G analogues to degrade ER, to inhibit transcriptional activity of ERα mutants, and to block cell proliferation in MCF7 cells expressing ERα mutants. We will use three different MCF7 derivative cell lines, each expressing an ERα mutant having a single point mutation Y537S, Y537N and D538G to the comparable level of endogenous wild type ERα. These cell lines are described in the literature and we recently obtained from Dr. Ben Ho Park (John Hopkins U.). See Scott, G. K. et al. (2016) “ERpS294 is a biomarker of ligand or mutational ERα activation and a breast cancer target for CDK2 inhibition,” Oncotarget, DOI: 10.18632/oncotarget. 12735.
Previous studies have shown that the exogenously expressed mutant ERα displayed a significantly reduced response to Tam and fulvestrant, and approximately 30-100-fold higher doses of anti-estrogens are needed to achieve the level of inhibition in these cell lines as compared with the dose required in cells expressing the wild type ERα. See Merenbakh-Lamin, K., Ben-Baruch, N., Yeheskel, A., Dvir, A., Soussan-Gutman, L., Jeselsohn, R., Yelensky, R., Brown, M., Miller, V. A., Sarid, D. et al. (2013) “D538G mutation in estrogen receptor-alpha: A novel mechanism for acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer,” Cancer research, 73:6856-6864 and Jeselsohn, R., Yelensky, R., Buchwalter, G., Frampton, G., Meric-Bernstam, F., Gonzalez-Angulo, A. M., Ferrer-Lozano, J., Perez-Fidalgo, J. A., Cristofanilli, M., Gomez, H. et al. (2014) “Emergence of constitutively active estrogen receptor-alpha mutations in pretreated advanced estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,” Clinical cancer research: an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, 20:1757-1767. Using these ERα mutant expressing cell lines, we will: (a) compare ERα degradation rate induced by fulvestrant, Dip G and Dip G-D1 using ELISA assay as shown in FIG. 5; (b) measure IC50 of Dip G and Dip G analogues to inhibit ERα transcriptional activity in luciferase assay. Our preliminary data showed that ERα-positive cell line T47D expressing ERα Y537S mutant elicits ligand-independent transcription activity (see FIG. 7) which can be inhibited by Dip G and DipG-D1; and (c) compare the effects of Dip G or its analogues, Tam and fulvestrant on the growth of MCF7 ER WT, Y537S, Y537N and D538G cells in the absence and presence of 10 nM E2.
We expect that Dip G and its analogues promote ERα degradation and inhibit cell proliferation even in cells expressing mutant ERα.
We will also assess in vivo effects of Dip G and a Dip G analogue in MCF7-derivative cell line xenografts. We will use Tam-resistant MCF7-derivative cell lines MCF7/LCC2, an anti-estrogen resistant model not caused by ERα mutation (see Brunner et al. (1993) “MCF7/LCC2: a 4-hydroxytamoxifen resistant human breast cancer variant that retains sensitivity to the steroidal anti-estrogen ICI 182,780,” Cancer research 53:3229-3232) and MCF7 ERα Y537S, Tam resistant model caused by ERα mutation for xenografts, followed by treatment with vehicle or Dip G and Dip G analogues that exhibit the strongest in vitro activity.
LCC2 or MCF7 ERY537S cells (2×106) will be orthotopically implanted into ovariectomized, athymic nude mice (5-week old, n=10) with or without E2 supplementation, as described in Wang, L., Zhao, Z., Meyer, M. B., Saha, S., Yu, M., Guo, A., Wisinski, K. B., Huang, W., Cai, W., Pike, J. W. et al. (2014) “CARM1 methylates chromatin remodeling factor BAF155 to enhance tumor progression and metastasis,” Cancer Cell 25:21-36. Mean tumor size will be measured weekly until the tumors reach 100 mm3. There will be a total of 4 groups (LCC2-E2, LCC2+E2, MCF7 ERY537S-E2, MCF7 ERY537S+E2). Each group (n=40) will be treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fulvestrant, Dip G, a Dip G analogue at 40 mg/kg by oral gavage for 21 consecutive days. 200 mg/kg of fulvestrant will be given by subcutaneous injection weekly. Tumor volume will be measured every other day. If tumor size reaches 500 mm3 or decreases to ⅓ of the original size, BrdU will be injected into mice one-hour prior to sacrifice. Tumors will be collected for IHC staining of ERα, BrdU and Ki67. The concentration of Dip G or its analogue in plasma and tumors will be determined using HPLC/MS/MS. ERα protein levels in tumors will be quantified using ELISA assay. We anticipate that the LCC2 cells will grow to tumors regardless of E2 but its growth will be stimulated by estrogen supplementation. We expect that Dip G and Dip G analogue treatment will lead to tumor regression, ERα degradation, and decrease of the proliferation index BrdU staining and Ki67.

Animal Studies:
Methods:
Diptoindonesin G (Dip G) was obtained from the small molecule screening facility. Dip G was prepared by dissolving the stock powder in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 50 mg/mL. This stock solution was then diluted 1:5 into a 40% polyethylene glycol (PEG 300)/40% normal saline (0.9% NaCl) solution to a final concentration of 20% Dip G solution. Vehicle was prepared identically, substituting DMSO instead of Dip G solution. PEG and saline were filtered at 0.2-0.5 m prior to use to ensure sterility.
Twelve Foxn1-nu homozygous mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me.). Mice were randomized to control or active treatment prior to estrogen pellet placement. After allowing time for acclimatization, estrogen pellets were surgically inserted into the test mice, subcutaneously on the back. The skin at the site of surgery was prepared by washing with povidone iodine, allowing a three-minute contact time. Surgery was performed in a laminar flow hood while mice were under anesthesia. Incisions of less than 1 cm were made low in the back using a short scissors. Slow-release estrogen pellets (0.05 mg/60 day release) were implanted in each incision. Wounds were sealed with “VETBOND”®-brand surgical adhesive (3M Company, St. Paul, Minn.). At the same time, the mice were injected with 107 T-47D cells (ATCC HTB-133) twice, once in each mammary fat pad underneath the leg with 100 uL of fluid per injection site, using 25G needles.
Mice were monitored twice weekly for weight changes and tumor growth (measured in diameter and volume) with calipers. Following tumors reaching an appropriate size (˜5 mm in diameter, taking approximately 3 months after grafting), intra-tumoral injections were begun with vehicle containing 20 mg/kg of Dip G or control vehicle in a total volume of 50 μL split between tumors on each mammary fat pad. Three mice (6 tumors) received control injections and eight (16 tumors) received Dip G. Injections were administered 3 times per week with at least one day of rest between injections, for a total of 10-12 injections. Cohorts were sacrificed by cage individually in numerical order, beginning with the 10th injection and sacrificing one cage per injection for pharmacokinetic time points from that injection onward. In mice with very small tumors, dosing was switched from intra-tumoral to subcutaneous at later time points.
Results:
One mouse was sacrificed prior to dosing due to a C. bovis infection that could not be cleared by antibiotic treatment.
Tumor sizes at baseline ranged for from 23 to 475 mm3, see Table 1, although the 475 mm3 tumor was an outlier.
Injection typically resulted in mild to moderate pain indicated by squinting and hunching, though signs of pain abated within 30 minutes. Injection also typically resulted in swelling of the tumor at the injection site, usually increasing tumor diameter by 0.5-2 mm. Swelling typically abated by 72 hours post-injection. Thus, measurements taken less than 72 hours apart are not considered representative of actual tumor growth.
Mice receiving Dip G compound showed signs of subcutaneous bleeding, bruising, and discoloration around the tumor and the site of injection. This phenomenon was not observed in mice injected with vehicle only. By dose 8, this discoloration was universal among Dip G-treated mice.
A summary of individual tumor measurements by day can be found in Table 1. Both vehicle and Dip G-treated tumors declined in volume with treatment. Control treated tumors (n=6 tumors, 3 mice) were 70% of original size (decreased by 30%) at study completion (95% confidence interval for the mean, 47-92%), while tumors (n=16 tumors, 8 mice) treated with Dip-G were 46% (95% confidence interval for the mean, 25-64%) of original size (decreased by 54%), although this did not quite meet statistical significance (p=0.06). See FIG. 3, which graphically presents the results tabulated in Table 1. Some tumors treated with Dip G resolved to the point of almost being unmeasureable (less than 10 mm3). Such resolution did not occur in the vehicle treated group.
Individual tumors decreasing by 50% of more were categorized as responders. In the control treated tumors (n=6 tumors, 3 mice), only one of six tumors responded (17%) while in mice (n=16 tumors, 8 mice) treated with Dip G, 12 of 16 (75%) responded, p=0.023, Fischer's exact test.
