TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to a compound for organic light-emitting diodes that can operate organic light-emitting diodes at a low driving voltage and an organic light-emitting diode comprising the same and, more particularly, to a compound for use as a fluorescent host in organic light-emitting diodes, which can bring about excellent diode properties by operating organic light-emitting diodes at a low driving voltage and an organic light-emitting diode comprising the same.
BACKGROUND ART
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), based on self-luminescence, enjoy the advantage of having a wide viewing angle and being able to be made thinner and lighter than liquid crystal displays (LCDs). In addition, an OLED display exhibits a very fast response time. Accordingly, OLEDs find applications in the illumination field as well as the full-color display field.
In general, the term “organic light-emitting phenomenon” refers to a phenomenon in which electrical energy is converted to light energy by means of an organic material. An OLED using the organic light-emitting phenomenon has a structure usually comprising an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween. In this regard, the organic material layer may be, for the most part, of a multilayer structure consisting of different materials, for example, a hole injecting layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injecting layer, in order to improve the efficiency and stability of the organic light-emitting diode (OLED). In the organic light-emitting diode having such a structure, when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes, a hole injected from the anode migrates to the organic layer while an electron is released from the cathode and moves toward the organic layer. In the luminescent zone, the hole and the electron recombine to produce an exciton. When the exciton returns to the ground state from the excited state, the molecule of the organic layer emits light. Such an organic light-emitting diode is known to have characteristics such as self-luminescence, high luminance, high efficiency, low driving voltage, a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response.
Materials used as organic layers in OLEDs may be divided into luminescent materials and charge transport materials, for example, a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron injection material, and an electron transport material. As for the luminescent materials, there are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers. The light-emitting mechanism forms the basis for classification of the luminescent materials as fluorescent or phosphorescent materials, which use excitons in singlet and triplet states, respectively. Further, luminescent materials may be divided according to color into blue, green, and red light-emitting materials. Furthermore, yellow and reddish yellow light-emitting materials have been developed in order to achieve more natural colors.
Meanwhile, when a single material is employed as the luminescent material, intermolecular actions cause the wavelength of maximum luminescence to shift toward a longer wavelength, decreasing color purity or attenuating light with consequent reduction in the efficiency of the diode. In this regard, a host-dopant system may be used as a luminescent material so as to increase the color purity and the light emission efficiency through energy transfer.
This is based on the principle whereby, when a dopant is smaller in energy band gap than a host accounting for the light-emitting layer, the addition of a small amount of the dopant to the host generates excitons from the light-emitting layer so that the excitons are transported to the dopant, emitting light at high efficiency. Here, light of desired wavelengths can be obtained depending on the kind of dopant because the wavelength of the host moves to the wavelength range of the dopant.
With regard to related arts pertaining to host compounds in the light-emitting layer, reference may be made to Korean Patent No. 10-0910150 (Aug. 3, 2009), which discloses an OLED comprising a luminescent medium layer containing a compound in which an anthracene structure has a heterocyclic ring as a substituent at a terminal position thereof, and Japanese Patent No. 5608978 (Oct. 22, 2014), which describes on OLED comprising a luminescent medium layer containing an anthracene derivative in which an anthracene moiety has a dibenzofuran moiety as a substituent at a terminal position thereof.
Despite a variety of kinds of compounds prepared for use in luminescent media layers including the related art, there is still the continued need to develop organic layer materials capable of driving OLEDs at a lower voltage.

Also, the present disclosure provides an OLED, comprising a first electrode; a second electrode facing the first electrode; and an organic layer interposed therebetween, wherein the organic layer contains at least one of the organic luminescent compounds of the present disclosure.
As used herein, the expression “(the organic layer) contains at least one organic compound” is construed to mean that (the organic layer) may contain one organic compound falling within the scope of the present disclosure or two or more different compounds falling within the scope of the present disclosure.
According to some particular embodiments of the present disclosure, the organic layer containing the compound of the present disclosure may comprise at least one of a hole injecting layer, a hole transport layer, a functional layer capable of both hole injection and hole transport, an electron transport layer, and an electron injecting layer.
In addition, the organic layer interposed between the first electrode and the second electrode may be a light-emitting layer. In this regard, the light-emitting layer may be composed of a host and a dopant wherein the compound of Chemical Formula A may be used as the host.

Further, one or more layers selected from among a hole injecting layer, a hole transport layer, a functional layer capable of both hole injection and hole transport, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injecting layer may be deposited using a single-molecule deposition process or a solution process. Here, the deposition process is a process by which a material is vaporized in a vacuum or at a low pressure and deposited to form a layer, and the solution process is a method in which a material is dissolved in a solvent and applied for the formation of a thin film by means of inkjet printing, roll-to-roll coating, screen printing, spray coating, dip coating, spin coating, etc.
Also, the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure may be applied to a device selected from among flat display devices, flexible display devices, monochrome or grayscale flat illumination devices, and monochrome or grayscale flexible illumination devices.
In one embodiment of the present disclosure, a hole transport layer (HTL) may be further deposited between the anode and the organic light-emitting layer while an electron transport layer (ETL) may be further deposited between the cathode and the organic light-emitting layer.
As a material for the hole transport layer, an electron donating molecule with low ionization potential is used. Predominantly, diamine, triamine or tetraamine derivatives having a triphenylamine skeleton are employed, as exemplified by N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-[1,1-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (TPD) and N,N'-di(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-diphenylbenzidine (a-NPD).
A hole injecting layer (HIL) may be further deposited beneath the hole transport layer. No particular limitations are imposed on the hole injecting layer material, as long as it is one that is typically used in the art. Examples include CuPc (copperphthalocyanine), and the starburst amines TCTA (4,4',4″-tri(N-carbazolyl)triphenyl-amine), and m-MTDATA (4,4',4″-tris-(3-methylphenylphenyl amino)triphenylamine).
Further, other examples of the hole injecting layer material include the oxadiazole derivatives PBD, BMD, and BND, and Alq3.
An electron injecting layer that functions to facilitate electron injection from the cathode, thus improving the power efficiency of the diode, may be further deposited on the electron transport layer. So long as it is conventionally used in the art, any material can be available for the electron injecting layer without particular limitations. Examples include LiF, NaCl, CsF, Li2O, and BaO.
Below, the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure is explained with reference to FIG. 1.
FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of the structure of an organic light-emitting diode according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The organic light-emitting diode comprises an anode 20, a hole transport layer 40, an organic light-emitting layer 50, an electron transport layer 60, and a cathode 80, and optionally a hole injecting layer 30 or an electron injecting layer 70. In addition, one or two intermediate layers may be further formed in the organic light-emitting diode.
Reference is made to FIG. 1 with regard to the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure and the fabrication thereof. First, a substrate 10 is coated with an anode electrode material to form an anode 20. So long as it is used in a typical organic EL device, any substrate may be used as the substrate 10. Preferable is an organic substrate or transparent plastic substrate that exhibits excellent transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and waterproofness. As the anode electrode material, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO2), or zinc oxide (ZnO), which are transparent and superior in terms of conductivity, may be used.
A hole injecting layer material is applied on the anode electrode 20 by thermal deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating to form a hole injecting layer 30. Subsequently, thermal deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating may also be conducted to form a hole transport layer 40 with a hole transport layer material on the hole injecting layer 30.
Then, an organic light-emitting layer 50 is deposited on the hole transport layer 40, optionally followed by the formation of a hole barrier layer (not shown) on the organic light-emitting layer 50 by deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating. When holes traverse the organic light-emitting layer and are introduced into the cathode, the efficiency and lifespan of the diode are deteriorated. Formed of a material with a low HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level, the hole barrier layer serves to prevent the introduction of holes into the cathode. Any material that has a higher ionization potential than the light-emitting compound and which is also able to carry electrons may be used for the hole barrier layer without limitation. Representative among hole barrier materials are BAlq, BCP, and TPBI.
Using a vacuum deposition method or a spin-coating method, an electron transport layer 60 may be deposited on the hole barrier layer and may then be overlaid with an electron injection layer 70. A cathode metal is deposited on the electron injection layer 70 by thermal deposition in a vacuum to form a cathode 80, thus obtaining an organic EL diode.

Examples 1-7: Fabrication of OLEDs
An ITO glass substrate was patterned to have a translucent area of 2 mm×2 mm and cleansed. The ITO glass was mounted in a vacuum chamber that was then set to have a base pressure of 1×10−7 torr. On the ITO glass substrate, films were formed of HAT-CN (50 Å) and α-NPD (600 Å) in that order. A light-emitting layer (200 Å) was formed of a mixture including each of the compounds shown in Table 1 and BD1 (5 wt %). Then, [Chemical Formula E-1] and [Chemical Formula E-2] were deposited at a ratio of 1:1 to form an electron transport layer 300 Å thick, on which an electron injection layer of [Chemical Formula E-1] (10 Å thick) was formed and then covered with an Al layer (1000 Å) to fabricate an organic light-emitting diode. The organic light-emitting diodes thus obtained were measured at 0.4 mA for luminescence properties.
