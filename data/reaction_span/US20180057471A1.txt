INTRODUCTION
Redox flow batteries (RFBs), which function by storing electrochemical energy in liquid electrolyte formulations, are promising technologies for energy storage on medium to large scales.1 Since the energy is stored in a liquid form, increasing the capacity of RFBs is largely a matter of increasing the size of active-material storage tanks. Current state-of-the-art RFBs are based upon aqueous vanadium chemistry. While such RFBs are robust and long-lived, they rely upon expensive transition metals as active materials that form redox active species. Additionally, these RFBs are aqueous-based and, therefore, are limited by the electrochemical stability window of water (about 1.5 V).2
One possibility for accessing higher voltages includes the use of non-aqueous electrolytes, which are generally not compatible with transition metal-based active materials. Although such systems have the potential for increasing the voltage of the system and reducing cost by exchanging scarce transition metals for plentiful carbon-based materials, the development and commercialization of organic non-aqueous redox flow batteries is largely in its infancy due to challenges in long term stability,3 atom economy,4 and solubility/energy density.5
For example, due to stability requirements for extended periods of time in both neutral and oxidized forms, only a limited number of molecular classes have been used for catholyte (positive electrolyte) material in preliminary all-organic non-aqueous RFBs, including dialkoxybenzenes6, stabile N-oxo radicals7, and phenothiaizines.8,9 These molecules are electron rich and are therefore capable of donating an electron when paired with an anolyte (negative electrolyte) material. However, molecules used as charge storage materials must also function with excellent atom economy. Vanadium-based aqueous RFBs have excellent atom economy with the ability to store an electron with 50 amu of mass. Organic materials, on the other hand, generally have molecular weights of about 150-300 amu due to need for stabilizing structures to allow for reversible electrochemical performance. This presents a challenge for organic non-aqueous systems as this represents a 65-85% reduction in atom economy relative to vanadium. Related to the increased molecular weights of organic materials are the lower concentrations of active species achieved in non-aqueous electrolytes. Only a handful of organic electroactive materials are capable of dissolving at concentrations greater than 0.5M.7,9
Accordingly, there exists a need for stable electroactive materials having sufficient atom economy for use in non-aqueous redox flow batteries.

In some embodiments, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds have stable first and second oxidation states (e.g., radical cation, dication). For example, suitable N-substituted phenothiazine compounds having stable first and second oxidation states include, but are not limited to, two-electron donor compounds having the structure:
<img> id-US20180057471A1-20180301-C00009.TIF </img>

In contrast to most phenothiazines, which decompose in the second oxidation state, the introduction of electron-donating functional groups to the phenothiazine redox-active core facilitates a reversible second oxidation event and/or formation of a doubly oxidized species that is stable for extended periods of time. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein provide stable two-electron redox-active materials. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 1 and Table 1, the dimethoxy-substituted phenothiazine derivatives, such as compounds I-IV shown above, provide stable first and second oxidations occurring at about 3.4 and 3.9 V vs. Li, respectively.

In certain embodiments, the stable first and second oxidations facilitate formation of stable dications in non-aqueous electrolytes without requiring an extensive increase (e.g., doubling) of molecular weight. By forming stable dications without extensive increases in molecular weight, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein provide increased atom economy (i.e., molecular weight per electron). Such atom utilization can be advantageous for both efficiency of the chemical processes and contribute to a greener chemistry process. In one embodiment, for example, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein increase atom economy by up to 100% as compared to existing compounds and/or catholytes.
Additionally, in some embodiments, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein provide increased solubility in electrolyte formulations as compared to existing compounds, such as 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)benzene (DBBB). In one embodiment, the glyme substituents provide increased solubility in electrolyte formulations as compared to other derivatives. For example, as compared to the N-ethyl derivative, which exhibited a solubility of about 100 mM, the glyme and diglyme derivatives exhibited higher solubility while retaining stable redox chemistry. In another embodiment, this solubility in organic solvents permits the use of renewable earth-abundant elements.
In some embodiments, the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein provide a multi-electron donor including high stability and solubility in catholyte formulations. In another embodiment, the catholyte material provides a multi-electron donor that retains high chemical stability when charged. In a further embodiment, as catholyte energy density is limited due to solubility, stability, and redox chemistry, the high solubility, ability to act as a multi-electron donor, and/or high chemical stability of the compounds described herein significantly increases volumetric energy density as compared to other catholyte materials. For example, when formulated at its solubility limit, diglyme-dimethoxyphenothiazine may provide approximately 5 times the volumetric energy of DBBB, which has an energy density of 10 Ah/L when formulated as a catholyte, and is limited by its solubility (0.4M) and redox chemistry, acting as a single electron donor.
The presently-disclosed subject matter also includes a method of making an N-substituted phenothiazine derivative. As illustrated in FIG. 2, in some embodiments, the method includes synthesizing an N-substituted phenothiazine according to previously reported procedures (e.g., Odom, 2014 and Kaur, 2015), forming a 3,7-dibromophenothiazine derivative through aromatic dibromination, and then forming a 3,7-dimethoxyphenothiazine derivative through methoxylation of the dibromophenothiazine. In one embodiment, the methoxylation includes treatment with sodium methoxide and copper (I) iodide in refluxing pyridine. Non-limiting examples of process conditions are provided below in Examples 1-3. In some embodiments, the reactions are scalable.
The presently-disclosed subject matter also includes a non-aqueous redox flow battery. In some embodiments, the non-aqueous redox flow battery includes a negative electrode immersed in a first non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution, a positive electrode immersed in a second non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution, and a semi-permeable separator interposed between the negative and positive electrodes. In one embodiment, the second non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution includes one or more of the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein. For example, in another embodiment, the one or more N-substituted phenothiazine compounds form the electro-active material for the catholyte of the non-aqueous redox flow batteries. In other embodiments, the presently disclosed invention includes a positive cell comprising a cathode and a catholyte including one or more of the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein.
In certain embodiments, the one or more N-substituted phenothiazine compounds include two electron-donating groups per phenothiazine, which approximately doubles electrode capacity, increases atom economy in redox flow batteries, and/or decreases battery cost as compared to phenothiazine compounds having one electron-donating group.
The presently disclosed subject matter is also directed to making a non-aqueous redox flow battery. The method of making a non-aqueous redox flow battery includes immersing a negative electrode in a first non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution, immersing a positive electrode in a second non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution, and interposing a semi-permeable separator between the negative and positive electrodes. The second non-aqueous liquid electrolyte solution including one or more of the N-substituted phenothiazine compounds described herein.

Darling et al., Pathways to low cost electrochemical energy storage: a comparison of aqueous and nonaqueous flow batteries, Energy Environ, Sci., 2014, 7, 3459-3477, incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The high solubility of the compounds disclosed herein in conjunction with the non-aqueous redox flow battery provides a higher capacity battery that can be used in commercial applications.
In some embodiments, the electro-active compound is part of a polymer. In this regard, the relative concentration of electro-active moiety can be described, rather than that of the entire polymer chain. For example, if a repeat unit of 1,000 monomers was included, then the concentration of monomer can be described, instead of the concentration the polymer chain, because in that case, the concentration of polymer would be about 1000× lower than the concentration of electro-active moiety.

Materials and Methods for Examples 1-3.
Hexanes, diethyl ether, and ethyl acetate were Macron brand purchased from VWR. Copper (I) iodide (98%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Magnesium sulfate was purchased from Fisher Scientific. Anhydrous methanol (99.8%), anhydrous pyridine (99.8%), and sodium were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Silica gel (65×250 mesh) was purchased from Sorbent Technologies. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on Varian spectrometers in DMSO-d6 from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories. Propylene carbonate and LiPF6 were battery grade and purchased from BASF Corporation (Florham Park, N.J.).
Dimethoxy-Substitutedphenothiazine Derivative Synthesis:
Dimethoxy-substituted phenothiazine derivatives were prepared in two steps from previously synthesized N-substituted phenothaizines (FIG. 2). In the first step, aromatic dibromination lead selectively to the 3,7-dibromophenothiazine derivatives. Methoxylation of the dibromophenothaizines was afforded by treatment with sodium methoxide and copper (I) iodide in refluxing pyridine. This reaction afforded the desired products in 45-91% yield. DMeOEPT (R=CH2CH3) and DMeOMEPT (R=CH2CH2OCH3) were isolated as white crystalline solids, while DMeOMEEPT (R=(CH2CH2O)2CH3) was isolated as a colorless oil. The products were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry, melting point (if crystalline), elemental analysis and single crystal x-ray diffraction (if crystalline) to confirm identity and purity.
Electrochemical Analysis:
The cyclic voltammetry experiments illustrated in FIG. 3 were performed with a CH Instruments 650E potentiostat using a three-electrode system with glassy carbon as the working electrode, Li metal as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as a counter electrode. Each solution contained 10 mM analyte and 0.5M LiBF4 in PC. Voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Oxidation potentials are reported relative to Li+/0.
Spectroelectrochemistry:
The results of spectroelectrochemical measurements on 0.375 mM DMeOEPT in 0.1M LiTFSI in PC are illustrated in FIG. 4. These data show that two distinct species are formed at each oxidation event, further supporting the formation of a radical cation, then a dication, in two separate events, rather than one two-electron-transfer event. Spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed using the spectroelectrochemical cell kit obtained from Pine research. 1 mL of the sample solution was placed in the quartz cuvette equipped with a Pt honeycomb electrode card, used as the working and the counter electrode and a freshly anodized Ag/AgCl electrode, used as the reference electrode. UV-vis spectra were obtained on an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrometer and electrochemical analysis was performed using a CH Instruments 650E potentiostat. First a UV-vis spectrum and a cyclic voltammogram was recorded on the sample. Bulk electrolysis (with coulometery) was then performed for 1 min at 0.1 V increments from 0 to 1.5 V and then back to 0 V; followed by a UV-vis measurement at each of those potentials. The chosen potential window was obtained from cyclic voltammogram measurement.

Discussion of Examples:
Preliminary experiments to determine the stability of dialkoxyphenothiazines on longer timescales were accomplished by half-cell cycling experiments versus lithium metal. Active material was dissolved at 0.01M in 0.5M LiBF4/PC and soaked into a graphite felt electrode. A 2032 coin cell was assembled with the graphite felt, a lithiated Nafion membrane and lithium metal. For one-electron transfer reactions, the coin cell was cycled between 3.1 and 3.6 V. All three dialkyoxybenzene shows high stability in one-electron cycling with high coulombic efficiency (>95% over 100 cycles) and little loss of active material over 100 cycles (FIGS. 5-7). Such performance suggests that the first oxidation state of these compounds is highly stable and does not react or decompose leading to decreased capacities. Crossover and premature reaction of the oxidized species at the lithium anode may account for the small loss in coloumbic efficiency.
For two-electron transfer reactions, the coin cell was cycled between 3.1 and 4.2 V in order to access the second oxidation state of the dialkoxyphenothiazines. Roughly twice the capacity of the one-electron experiment is observed but with reduced coulombic efficiency (about 80-90%). The reduced coulombic efficiency is likely due to extended charging times leading to increased membrane crossover and premature reduction of the active material. Little loss of active material is observed which is promising as it again suggests that the material is stable in its second oxidation state form. Additionally, as shown by the cyclic voltammetry experiments discussed above (FIG. 3), both first and second oxidation events were reversible and were observed at about 3.4 V and 4.0 V for all three compounds.
