CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2016-0137892, filed on Jul. 12, 2016, in the Japanese Patent Office, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. §119, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to an ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, an organic light-emitting device including a film formed by using the ink composition, and a method of manufacturing the organic light-emitting device.
2. Description of the Related Art
In general, an organic light-emitting device (OLED) includes an anode, a hole transport layer, an emission layer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode. When an electric field is applied to the organic light-emitting device, holes are injected from the anode to the hole transport layer, and electrons are injected from the cathode to the electron transport layer. The holes and the electrons then move toward the emission layer and recombine in the emission layer to generate energy. The generated energy causes a light-emitting material in the emission layer to emit light. In some cases, the organic light-emitting device may not include the hole transport layer and/or the electron transport layer. Furthermore, the organic light-emitting device may further include a hole injection layer and an electron injection layer.
The constituting layers of the organic light-emitting device are generally formed by using dry deposition or wet deposition.
In the dry deposition, a deposition film is formed by heating and evaporating an organic material in a vacuum environment. In the wet deposition, a film is formed by coating a coating composition (for example, an ink composition) including an organic material and drying the coated film obtained therefrom.
Recently, wet deposition, for example, inkjet printing, has attracted attention due to its use in high-resolution patterning and its high material utilization efficiency. There still remains a need in the art for an ink composition possessing optimal properties to be used in an organic light-emitting device.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING
These and/or other aspects will become apparent and more readily appreciated from the following description of the embodiments, taken in conjunction with the FIGURE which is a schematic partial cross-sectional view for describing a method of forming a coating film by using inkjet printing.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. In this regard, the present embodiments may have different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the descriptions set forth herein. Accordingly, the embodiments are merely described below, by referring to the figures, to explain aspects of the present description. As used herein, the term “and/or” includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items. Expressions such as “at least one of,” when preceding a list of elements, modify the entire list of elements and do not modify the individual elements of the list.
It will be understood that when an element is referred to as being “on” another element, it can be directly in contact with the other element or intervening elements may be present therebetween. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being “directly on” another element, there are no intervening elements present.
It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers, and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer, or section from another element, component, region, layer, or section.
Thus, a first element, component, region, layer, or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer, or section without departing from the teachings of the present embodiments.
The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
The term “or” means “and/or.” It will be further understood that the terms “comprises” and/or “comprising,” or “includes” and/or “including” when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, regions, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.
Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this general inventive concept belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and the present disclosure, and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.
Exemplary embodiments are described herein with reference to cross section illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments described herein should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions as illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a region illustrated or described as flat may, typically, have rough and/or nonlinear features. Moreover, sharp angles that are illustrated may be rounded. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the precise shape of a region and are not intended to limit the scope of the present claims.
“About” or “approximately” as used herein is inclusive of the stated value and means within an acceptable range of deviation for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, considering the measurement in question and the error associated with measurement of the particular quantity (i.e., the limitations of the measurement system). For example, “about” can mean within one or more standard deviations, or within ±30%, 20%, 10%, 5% of the stated value.
Hereinafter, various embodiments of the present disclosure will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.
Ink Composition for Organic Light-Emitting Device
An ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, according to an embodiment, may include a luminescent host material and a solvent, wherein the luminescent host material may include at least one compound represented by Formula (1). The ink composition may, if necessary, further include other luminescent impurities (for example, a dopant for use in an emission layer of an organic light-emitting device), an additive, and the like. The term “light emission” or “luminescence” as used herein includes a light emission caused by fluorescence and light emission caused by phosphorescence.
The ink composition for an organic light-emitting device has excellent inkjet discharge stability, and accordingly, an organic light-emitting device, which includes a film formed by using the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, may have high luminescent efficiency. While not wishing to be bound by any theory, the reason for this is understood to be due to a mechanism to be described below. Also, since the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device has excellent inkjet discharge stability, it may be used as an ink composition for inkjet printing.
Although not limited by a specific theory, when a composition A that includes a luminescent host material including at least one compound represented by Formula (1) and an aliphatic ether solvent, compatibility between the luminescent host material and the aliphatic ether solvent is insufficient, and thus, aggregation of the luminescent host material may occur in the composition A. Therefore, when inkjet printing is performed by using the composition A, the luminescent host material may precipitate around an inkjet nozzle, and inkjet discharge stability may be reduced due to a deterioration in straightness of droplets. Also, the aggregation of droplets of the composition A attached on a support accelerates when dried, resulting in a reduction in luminescent efficiency of an organic light-emitting device including a film formed by using the composition A.
However, unlike the composition A described above, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device uses at least one compound selected from an aromatic ether, an aromatic ester, and an aromatic ketone as a solvent, and accordingly, compatibility between the luminescent host material including the compound represented by Formula (1) and the solvent may be improved. Also, since an aromatic group and an ether group or a carbonyl group in the solvent relaxes a stacking interaction of the luminescent host material, the aggregation of the luminescent host material may be suppressed. Thus, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device has excellent inkjet discharge stability, and luminescent efficiency of an organic light-emitting device including a film formed by the ink composition may be improved.
The above-described mechanism is merely a presumption, and even if the effects of the present disclosure are obtained by other mechanisms, they fall within the technical scope of the present disclosure.
Luminescent Host Material
The luminescent host material may be used in an organic layer of an organic light-emitting device for various purposes.
For example, the luminescent host material may be used for a luminescent host in an emission layer of an organic light-emitting device.
The luminescent host may have a function of transporting holes and electrons injected into the emission layer.
The luminescent host material may include at least one compound represented by Formula (1):

In one or more embodiments, the luminescent host material may be a mixture of at least one compound represented by Formula (1), in which at least one of A1 to A3 is each independently represented by Formula (2-A), and at least one compound may have a biscarbazole backbone.

A molecular weight of the luminescent host material may be about 5,000 grams per mole (g/mol) or less, for example, about 2,000 g/mol or less. In an embodiment, the molecular weight of the luminescent host material may be in a range of about 300 g/mol to about 2,000 g/mol. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the molecular weight of the luminescent host material is within this range, the luminescent host material may be easily dispersed in the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device.

The term “high-molecular-weight (polymeric)” as used herein means that a weight average molecular weight (Mw) is greater than 5,000 Da.

While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the amount of the luminescent host material is within this range, a uniform film may be formed by using the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, and precipitation of the luminescent host material in the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may be substantially suppressed.
Luminescent Impurities
The ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may further include, in addition to the luminescent host material described above, luminescent impurities.
The luminescent impurities may be a phosphorescent dopant or a fluorescent dopant.
Examples of the luminescent impurities may include a perylene and a derivative thereof, a rubrene and a derivative thereof, a coumarin and a derivative thereof, 4-dicyanomethylene-2-(p-dimethylaminostyryl)-6-methyl-4H-pyran (DCM) and a derivative thereof, an iridium (Ir) complex such as bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinate]picolinate iridium (III) (Flrpic), bis(1-phenylisoquinoline)(acetylacetonate)iridium (III) (Ir(piq)2(acac)), tris(2-(3-p-xylyl)phenyl)pyridine iridium) (III), or tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3), an osmium (Os) complex, and a platinum complex.

Although not particularly limited, the aromatic ether may use a compound represented by Formula (4):
<img> id-US20180019411A1-20180118-C00066.TIF </img>
In Formula (4), X1 may be a C1-C6 alkyl group, and X2 may be a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, or a propyl group.

<img> id-US20180019411A1-20180118-C00068.TIF </img>
In Formula (6), Z1 may be a C1-C4 alkyl group, and Z2 may be a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, or an ethyl group.
Specific examples of the aromatic ketone may include an acetophenone, a 4'-methylacetophenone, a propiophenone, a 4'-methylpropiophenone, a butylophenone, and a 4'-methylbutylophenone.
In an embodiment, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may include an aromatic ether and/or an aromatic ester so as to improve luminescent efficiency and inkjet discharge stability of the organic light-emitting device.
In one or more embodiments, an aromatic ether that does not have a polar group, for example, a carbonyl group, which inhibits charge transport of the luminescent host material, may be used as a solvent for the ink composition, even if it is remained in a coating film.
A solubility of the solvent in water at a temperature of 20° C. may be about 1% or less, for example, about 0.9% or less, and in another example, about 0.7% or less. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the solubility of the solvent in water at a temperature of 200° C. is within this range, an organic light-emitting device including a film formed by using the ink composition including the solvent may substantially prevent generation of dark spots and short, durability deterioration, and the like.
A viscosity of the solvent may be in a range of about 1.0 millipascal seconds (mPa·s) to about 3.5 mPa·s, for example, about 1.2 mPa·s to about 3.0 mPa·s, and in another example, about 1.5 mPa·s to about 2.5 mPa·s. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the viscosity of the solvent is within this range, it is possible to substantially prevent a nozzle of an inkjet head from being clogged during inkjet printing using the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, and small droplets of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may be easily discharged from an inkjet head.
A surface tension of the solvent may be in a range of about 20 millinewtons per meter (mN/m) to about 45 mN/m, for example, about 25 mN/m to about 43 mN/m, and in another example, 28 mN/m to about 40 mN/m. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the surface tension of the solvent is within this range, wettability of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device on a surface of a nozzle is controlled as desired. Accordingly, a phenomenon in which the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device is attached around the nozzle, and thus, a flow direction of a droplet is bent is substantially prevented. Also, since a meniscus shape at a front end of the nozzle is stable, it is possible to easily control a discharge amount and a discharge timing of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device.
Also, the solvents described above may be used alone or in a combination of two or more solvents.
In an embodiment, the solvent may include two or more different compounds selected from an aromatic ether, an aromatic ester, and an aromatic ketone.
For example, the solvent may be an aromatic ether, an aromatic ester, or an aromatic ketone, as described above, or may be a mixture of the aromatic ether and the aromatic ester, a mixture of the aromatic ester and the aromatic ketone, a mixture of the aromatic ether and the aromatic ketone, or a mixture of the aromatic ether, the aromatic ester, and the aromatic ketone.
In an embodiment, the solvent may include at least one of an aromatic ether and an aromatic ester.
Also, for the purpose of suppressing the drying of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device at the nozzle of the inkjet head, a vapor pressure of the solvent at a temperature of 25° C. may be about 1 mmHg or less, for example, about 0.5 mmHg or less, and in another example, about 0.01 to mmHg to about 0.5 mmHg. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the vapor pressure of the solvent is within these ranges, it is possible to substantially prevent deterioration in luminescent efficiency and durability of an organic light-emitting device, even when the solvent exists in the coating film after drying.
On the other hand, in order to improve leveling during drying of inkjet-discharged substances or in order to improve solubility of the luminescent material, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may further include other solvents as well as the solvent described above.
As the other solvents, any solvents may be used as long as these solvents are capable of dissolving the luminescent material. Specific examples of the solvents may include: a halogen-containing solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethane, trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, or chlorotoluene; a hydrocarbon solvent having 6 or more carbon atoms, such as hexane, heptane, octane, nonane, decane, or undecane; and an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, butylbenzene, pentylbenzene, hexylbenzene, nonylbenzene, decylbenzene, undecylbenzene, dodecylbenzene, tetralin, or cyclohexylbenzene.
Also, the other solvents described above may be used alone or in a combination of two or more solvents.

Although not particularly limited, the silicon compound may be a dimethyl silicone, a methyl silicone, a phenyl silicone, a methyl phenyl silicone, an alkyl-modified silicone, an alkoxy-modified silicone, or a polyether-modified silicone. For example, a dimethyl silicone or a methyl phenyl silicone may be used as the silicon compound.
Although not particularly limited, the fluorine-containing compound may be a polytetrafluoroethylene, a polyvinylidene fluoride, a fluoroalkyl methacrylate, a perfluoropolyether, or a perfluoroalkylethylene oxide. For example, a polytetrafluoroethylene may be used as the fluorine-containing compound.
Although not particularly limited, the siloxane-containing compound may be a dimethylsiloxane compound (product name: KF96L-1, KF96L-5, KF96L-10, KF96L-100, manufactured by Shinetsu Silicon Inc.).
In an embodiment, a silicon-containing compound, a fluorine-containing compound and/or a siloxane-containing compound among the leveling agents described above may be used. In one or more embodiments, a siloxane-containing compound may be used.
Also, the leveling agents described above may be used alone or in a combination of two or more leveling agents.
Although an amount of the leveling agent changes according to desired performance, the amount of the leveling agent may be in a range of about 0.001 parts by weight to about 5 parts by weight, for example, about 0.001 parts by weight to about 1 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the amount of the leveling agent is within this range, leveling of a coating film and luminescent efficiency of a light-emitting device may be improved.

Although not particularly limited, the viscosity modifier may be a thermoplastic resin such as a poly(a-methylstyrene), a polystyrene, a styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, a styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, a polymethylmethacrylate, a methacrylate-styrene copolymer, or a polycarbonate. For example, a poly(a-methylstyrene), a polystyrene, a styreneacrylonitrile copolymer, a styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, or a polymethylmethacrylate may be used as the viscosity modifier.
The viscosity modifiers described above may be used alone or in a combination of two or more viscosity modifiers.
Although an amount of the viscosity modifier changes according to desired performance, the amount of the viscosity modifier may be in a range of about 0.001 parts by weight to about 5 parts by weight, for example, about 0.01 parts by weight to about 1 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the amount of the viscosity modifier is within this range, the aggregation of the luminescent host material in the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may be substantially suppressed, the luminescent efficiency of an organic light-emitting device may be improved, and a flow shape of droplets of the inkjet composition may be improved.

Referring to the FIGURE, the organic light-emitting device includes a substrate 1, a plurality of anodes 2 disposed on the substrate 1, and a hole transport layer 4 disposed on the anodes 2. In this case, laminates of the plurality of anodes 2 and the hole transport layer 4 on the substrate 1 are separated by banks 3. When the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device is discharged from a nozzle 6 of an inkjet head 7, a coating film 5 of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device is formed on the hole transport layer 3. The obtained coating film is dried to form an emission layer.
Ink Composition for Organic Light-Emitting Device
Since the ink composition described above is usable as the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device, a description thereof will be omitted.
Support
The support is a constituting layer of the organic light-emitting device adjacent to the emission layer and is different according to an organic light-emitting device to be manufactured. For example, in the case of manufacturing an organic light-emitting device including an anode, an emission layer, and a cathode, the support is the anode or the cathode. Also, in the case of manufacturing an organic light-emitting device including an anode, a hole injection layer, an emission layer, an electron injection layer, and a cathode, the support is the hole injection layer or the electron transport layer. As described above, the support may be an anode, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an electron transport layer, an electron injection layer, or a cathode, for example, an anode, a hole injection layer, or a hole transport layer. In another example, the support may be a hole injection layer or a hole transport layer. For example, the support may be a hole transport layer.
Also, a bank may be formed in the support. Due to the bank, the emission layer may be formed only in desired portions.
A height of the bank may be in a range of about 0.1 μm to about 5.0 μm, for example, about 0.2 μm to about 3.0 μm. For example, the height of the bank may be in a range of about 0.2 μm to about 2.0 μm.
Also, a width of an opening of the bank may be in a range of about 10 μm to about 200 μm, for example, about 30 μm to about 200 μm, and in another example, about 50 μm to about 100 μm.
Also, a length of the opening of the bank may be in a range of about 10 μm to about 400 μm, for example, about 20 μm to about 200 μm, and in another example, about 50 μm to about 200 μm.
Also, a taper angle of the bank may be in a range of about 10° to about 100°, for example, about 10° to about 90°, and in another example, about 10° to about 80°.
Coating
The coating is performed by inkjet printing. For example, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device is discharged from the nozzle of the inkjet head toward the support.
In this case, a discharge amount of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device may be in a range of about 1 picoliters (pL) to about 50 pL each time, for example, about 1 pL to about 30 pL each time, and in another example, about 1 pL to about 20 pL each time.
An diameter of an opening of the inkjet head may be in a range of about 5 μm to about 50 μm, for example, about 10 μm to about 30 μm, to minimize nozzle clogging or improve discharge precision.
Although not particularly limited, a temperature during the forming of the coating film may be in range of about 10° C. to about 50° C., for example, about 15° C. to about 40° C., and in another example, about 15° C. to about 30° C., so as to suppress crystallization of the luminescent material (luminescent host and/or luminescent impurity material) included in the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device.
Although not particularly limited, a relative humidity during the forming of the coating film may be in a range of about 0.01 parts per million (ppm) to about 80%, for example, about 0.05 ppm to about 60%, and in another example, about 0.1 ppm to about 15%. In an embodiment, the relative humidity may be in a range of about 1 ppm to about 1%, for example, about 5 ppm to about 100 ppm. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is understood that when the relative humidity is within this range, control of the conditions for forming the coating film is facilitated, and the amount of moisture adsorbed on the coating film, which may affect the coating film, may be reduced.
Drying
The obtained coating layer is dried to form the emission layer.
Although not particularly limited, a drying temperature may be room temperature (25° C.), or may be raised by heating. When heating is used, the drying temperature may be about 40° C. to about 130° C., for example, about 40° C. to about 80° C.
Also, a pressure during the drying may be a reduced pressure. For example, a reduced pressure condition of about 0.001 pascals (Pa) to about 100 Pa may be used.
Also, a drying time may be in a range of about 1 minute to about 90 minutes, for example, about 1 minute to about 30 minutes.
Process of Forming Other Layers
The other layers constituting the organic light-emitting device, for example, the anode, the hole injection layer, the hole transport layer, the electron transport layer, the electron injection layer, and the cathode, may be formed by appropriately selecting known methods.
For example, the anode and the cathode may be formed by deposition or sputtering.
Also, the hole injection layer, the hole transport layer, the electron transport layer, and the electron injection layer may be formed by vacuum deposition, spin coating, casting, inkjet printing, or Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) deposition.
Example of Method of Manufacturing Organic Light-Emitting Device
A method of manufacturing an organic light-emitting device may include:
forming an anode on a substrate;
forming an emission layer including the luminescent host material by coating the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device on the anode and drying the obtained coating film; and
forming a cathode on the emission layer.
The expression “B on A” used herein may include a case in which A and B directly contact each other and a case in which A and B are spaced apart from each other.
The coating of the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device on the cathode may be performed by inkjet printing.

Referring to Table 1, it has been determined that the ink compositions prepared according to Examples 1 to 9 have excellent inkjet discharge stability, as compared with the ink composition prepared by using a non-aromatic solvent according to Comparative Example 1. Also, it is confirmed that high luminescent efficiency is exhibited when an aromatic solvent having a vapor pressure of about 1 mmHg is used.
As described above, the ink composition for an organic light-emitting device has excellent inkjet discharge stability, and accordingly, an organic light-emitting device, which includes a film formed by using the ink composition, may have high luminescent efficiency.
