FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention belongs to the field of medicine, and relates to a piperidine derivative and a preparation method thereof and a pharmaceutical use thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to a piperidine derivative as shown by general formula (I) and a preparation method thereof and a pharmaceutical composition containing same, and the use thereof as an estrogen receptor modulator in treating an estrogen receptor mediated or dependent disease or condition, particularly preferably breast cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
After a long period of basic research and clinical monitoring, it is found that diseases such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease are closely related to the abnormality of estrogen signaling pathway. Estrogen is a steroid hormone secreted by the endocrine system, and plays an important role in the reproductive system, bone tissue, cardiovascular system, immune system and central nervous system. Estrogen signal transduction system plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. The occurrence and development of estrogen-dependent tumors, such as breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and endometrial cancer, are closely related to estrogen. Now the main chemotherapy for breast cancer is the use of antiestrogen agents, such as Tamoxifen. However, Tamoxifen exerts estrogen agonist properties in the uterus, thereby stimulating cancer cells in uterus. Due to these serious side effects, it is imperative to seek a new safe and effective treatment.
One important protein of estrogen signaling pathway is estrogen receptor (ER). ER is a steroid hormone receptor, and belongs to a ligand-activated transcription factor of the nuclear receptor superfamily that contains two subtypes: ERa (discovered in 1950) and ERβ (discovered in 1996), encoded by different genes respectively. ERα and ERβ show a high degree of similarity at the amino acide level, and their similarity in the DNA binding domain is up to 97%, and the similarity in the ligand binding domain is up to 56%, but only 24% low homology in the N terminus. ER contains 6 domains from A to F, which comprise of four main functional areas. The functional area of the N terminal A/B domain has a ligand indenpendent transcriptional activation function AF-1, and AF-1 has a constitutive activity. The transcription of target genes is activated by interaction with basic transcription factors, reactivation factors and other transcription factors. There are multiple phosphorylation sites in this function, and it is reported that the role of AF-1 depends on protein phosphorylation. The DNA binding domain (DBD) composed of C domain is highly conservative and contains 2 zinc finger domains that can specifically bind to the target DNA, at the same time, this domain plays an important role in the dimerzation of receptors. The D domain is a hinge region that connects the DBD and the ligand binding domain (LBD), with low conservatism (only 30% homology between two subtypes). The ligand binding domain (LBD) composed of C terminal E domain determines the specific binding of ER to ligands such as estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), and selective estrogen receptor downregulator (SERD). LBD has a ligand dependent transcriptional activation function AF-2, which has a synergistic reaction with AF-1 to exert ER receptor's role in activating the transcription of target gene. At the same time, LBD has a strong dimerization interface and still can function without ligands. Therefore, LBD is the key site for receptor dimerization.
ERa is mainly distributed in the uterus, ovary, testis, pituitary, kidney, epididymis and adrenal gland, while ERβ is mainly distributed in the prostate, ovary, lung, bladder, brain and blood vessels. Due to the serious side effects of full agonists or full antagonists, the study of SERM arises. The "selectivity" means that SERM acts as agonist in some tissues such as bone, liver and cardiovascular system that are rich in ERβ, whereas it acts as antagonist in some other tissues such as mammary gland. In the uterus, the significant region of ERα, it can be either agonist or antagonist. So far the commercially available SERM include Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, Bazedoxifene, Toremifene and the like. However, the studies have found that the commercially available SERM still have serious side effects, for example, the long-term use of Tamoxifen and Toremifene can cause endometrial hyperplasia, polyps and endomentrial cancer, and the common side effects of Raloxifene include hot flashes, leg pain, breast tenderness and venous thrombosis and the like. Therefore, the research and development of new compounds are still urgent problems to be solved.
Tamoxifen belongs to a class of compounds known as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and has the ability to stabilize ERα and slightly up regulate the level of ERa receptors. In contrast, fulvestrant induces rapid degradation of ERa and intensifies the blockage of the ER receptor signaling pathway, such compounds are called as selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs). The differences in the mechanisms of actions of these SERMs and SERDs seem to be the mechanisms responsible for the resistance of these compounds. A large number of tumors that are tamoxifen resistant and ER positive are still sensitive to fulvestrant. It is found clinically that SERDs such as fulvestrant can effectively treat some breast cancers that are ERa positive and tamoxifen resistant. Therefore, the compounds responsible for degradation of ERa can be used to prolong the duration of efficacy in breast cancer patients successfully treated with anti-estrogen therapy, where different SERMs, aromatase inhibitiors and SERDs can be used successively.
The patent applications disclosing selective estrogen receptor mediated modulators include WO2014165723, WO2014151899, WO2014141292, WO2014135834 and WO2014106848.
In order to achieve better therapeutic effect and to better meet the needs of the market, the inventors hope to develop a new generation of highly effective and low toxic SERD targeting the estrogen signaling pathway. The present invention provides a novel structure of SERD, and it is found that the compounds with such a structure have good activity and show excellent ER receptor antagonism.

BIOLOGICAL ASSAY
The present invention will be further described with reference to the following test examples, but the examples should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention.
Test Example 1. Inhibition effect of the compounds of the present invention on the binding of E to ER
1. Experimental Object
The compounds of the present invention have an inhibition effect on the binding of E (estrogen) to ER (estrogen receptor), thereby blocking the binding of a complex of E and ER to ERE (estrogen responsive element), and subsequently blocking the expression of downstream luciferase protein.
The inhibition effect of the compounds on the binding of E to ER in vitro was tested by the following method.
The object of this experiment was to determine the inhibition effect of the compounds on the binding of E to ER, and the in vitro activity of the compounds was evaluated according to IC50 value.
2. Experimental Method
ERE was cloned into the upstream of the luciferase gene, and MCF-7/ ERE-luciferase monoclonal cells were selected by transfection of MCF-7 (Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences typical culture preservation Committee, TCHu74). MCF-7/ERE-luciferase cells were inoculated into the MEM medium (hyclone, SH30024.01B) containing 10% charcoal stripped FBS (Moregate, FBSF), 1% sodium pyruvate (sigma, S8636), 1% nonessential amino acids (sigma, M7145) and 500 µg/ml G418 in a 96-well plate with a density of 30,000 cells/well, and the cells were incubated under the conditions of 37°C and 5% CO2. The drug was prepared as a 20 mM stock solution that was later diluted with 100% DMSO in 10 fold concentration gradient, and then diluted with 20-fold medium. After incubation for 24 hours, the medium was removed, then 0.1 nM estradiol (sigma, E2758) and 10 µl of the drug diluted with the medium were added to each well, and the control group was added with DMSO. The plate was gently shaken and incubated in a incubator at 37°C, 5%CO2. After 24 hours, the cell culture medium was discarded. 50 µL of the prepared luciferase substrate (promega, E6110) was added to each well, and the plate was placed in dark at room temperature for 10-15 minutes, then the chemiluminescence signal value was determined.
3. Test Result
The inhibition effect of the compounds of the present invention on the binding of E to ER was tested by the experiment described above. The values of the chemiluminescence signal vs the logarithmic concentrations of the compounds were plotted using Graghpad Prism, and the IC50 values were shown in Table 1.

The compound was prepared as a 20 mM stock solution that was later diluted to 1000× final concentration with 100% DMSO, and then diluted with 20-fold medium containing 2% FBS. After incubation for 24 hours, the medium was removed, then 90 µl of the medium containing 2% FBS and 10 µl of the drug were added to each well, 10 µl of DMSO was added to the control group, and the blank group contained only 100 µl medium containing 2% FBS. The plate was gently shaken and incubated in a incubator at 37°C, 5%CO2. After 72 hours, 50 µl of mixed Cell Titer-Glo (Promega, G7571) was added to each well. The plate was shaken until ingredients are mixed well, and placed at room temperature for 10 minutes, then the chemiluminescence signal value was determined.
3. Data analysis
The values of the chemiluminescence signals vs the logarithmic concentrations of the compounds were plotted using Graghpad Prism to obtain IC50 values. The results were shown in Table 1.

3. Experimental Method
MCF-7 cells were incubated into DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS.
On the first day of the experiment, MCF-7 cells were resuspended in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 10% FBS treated by activated carbon, then inoculated into a 48-well plate with a density of 50,000 cells/well and incubated for 22-24 hours.
On the second day of the experiment, the test compound was diluted with medium and added to a 48-well plate. The ERα-capture antibody was diluted to 1µg/ml with PBS, added to a 96-well plate at 100 µl/well. The plate was sealed and coated overnight at room temperature.
On the third day of the experiment, the coated 96-well plate was washed twice with PBS, added with a sealing solution (1% BSA in PBS) at 110 µl/well and sealed for 1 hour at room temperature. The 48-well plate was washed once with PBS, and the residual liquid was removed. 60µl of lysis (6 M urea, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, Protease Inhibitor cocktail) was added to each well. After lysis on ice for 15 minutes, the diluent (1 mM EDTA, 0.5% TritonX-100 dissolved in PBS) was added. The cell-diluted lysate was transferred to a 96-well plate at 100 µl/well, then the plate was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. The diluted primary antibody was added after the plate was washed 4 times with a washing liquid (PBST). After incubation for 1 hour, the 96-well plate was washed 4 times, and the second antibody was added, then the plate was incubated for 30 minutes. After the plate was washed with a washing liquid, TMB chromogenic solution was added and incubated for 15 minutes. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 M H2SO4, then the light absorption at 450nm was read.
