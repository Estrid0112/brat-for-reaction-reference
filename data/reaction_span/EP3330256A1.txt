TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a compound that has a TrkA inhibitory activity and is useful in the treatment and/or prevention of TrkA mediated disorders, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising the same.
BACKGROUND ART
The tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) is a family of receptor tyrosine kinases and has a function as a receptor of neurotrophin (NT). Three major subtypes of Trk receptors are TrkA high-affinity receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF), TrkB high-affinity receptor for brain-derived neutrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5, and TrkC high-affinity receptor for NT-3. All receptors involve in various physiological function in vivo. TrkA is mainly expressed in peripheral and central nerves, and involves in neuronal development and differentiation, and maintenance of neuronal functions. The gene mutation in TrkA is associated with painless anhidrosis in human (Patent Documents 1, 2 and Non-patent Documents 1 to 3). The activation of NGF-TrkA signal produces hypralgesia (Non-patent Documents 4 to 6). Clinical and non-clinical researches regarding anti-NGF antibodies and non-clinical researches regarding Trk inhibitors reveal the involvement of NGF-TrkA signal or NT-Trk signal in the pain of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, bone fracture, interstitial cystitis, chronic pancreatitis and prostatitis in addition to nociceptive pain such as chronic low back pain, neuropathic pain such as diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, acute pain sucha as postoperative pain and chronic pain such as pelvic pain and cancer pain (Patent Documents 1, 2 and Non-patent documents 7, 8).
Trk receptors are also expressed in several types of cancer cells such as neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer and pancreatic cancer, and involve in the proliferation and migration of cancer cells. The fusion protein combined with TrkA kinase domain causes the proliferation of lung cancer cells. Trk inhibitor is shown to suppress the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells in animal model. (Patent Document 1 and Non-patent Documents 9 to 12). Furthermore, Trk receptors are expressed in mast cells, eosinophils, immunocompetent cells such as T and B cells and keratinocytes, and NGF-trkA signal or NT-Trk signal involves in inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, allergic diseases such as asthma and rhinitis, and skin diseases such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and pruritus (Patent Documents 1, 2). In addition, the inhibition of NGF-TrkA signal improves the overactive bladder (Patent Document 1). NT-Trk signal also involves in Sjogren's syndrome (Patent Document 1) and endometriosis (Patent Document 1). TrkA receptor plays a critical role in the infection process of the parasitic infection of Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) (Patent Document 1). Therefore, the compounds having an inhibitory activity for TrkA will be effective for various diseases including nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, cancer, inflammatory diseases, allergic diseases and dermatological diseases.
The compounds that have an inhibitory activity for TrkA are disclosed in Patent Documents 1 to 16 and Non-patent Documents 6, 13 to 14. However, the compounds related to the present invention aren't indicated and suggested in any documents.

A radiolabeled compound of the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) can be prepared using well-known methods in this field of the invention. For example, a tritium-labeled compound of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) can be prepared by introducing a tritium to a certain compound of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) through a catalytic dehalogenation reaction using a tritium. This method comprises reacting an appropriately-halogenated precursor of the compound of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) with tritium gas in the presence of an appropriate catalyst, such as Pd/C, and in the presence or absent of a base. The other appropriate method of preparing a tritium-labeled compound can be referred to "Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987)". A 14C-labeled compound can be prepared by using a raw material having 14C.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) include, for example, salts with alkaline metal (e.g., lithium, sodium, or potassium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., calcium or barium), magnesium, transition metal (e.g., zinc or iron), ammonia, organic bases (e.g., trimethylamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, meglumine, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, pyridine, picoline, or quinoline), amino acids, or salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, carbonic acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, or hydroiodic acid) or organic acids (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, mandelic acid, glutaric acid, malic acid, benzoic acid, phthalic acid, ascorbic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or ethanesulfonic acid). Especially, salts with hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid and the like are included. These salts can be formed by the usual methods.

The present invention encompasses those various solvates, co-crystal and crystal polymorphs. "Solvates" may be those wherein any numbers of solvent molecules (e.g., water molecules) are coordinated with the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA). When the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are allowed to stand in the atmosphere, the compounds may absorb water, resulting in attachment of adsorbed water or formation of hydrates. Recrystallization of the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may produce crystal polymorphs.

Prodrugs include compounds that are converted to the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) through enzymatic oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis or the like under physiological conditions in vivo, compounds that are converted to the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) through hydrolysis by gastric acid etc., and the like. Methods for selecting and preparing suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, "Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier, Amsrdam, 1985". Prodrugs themselves may have some activity.
When the compounds of Formula (I) or Formula (IA) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof have hydroxyl group(s), prodrugs include acyloxy derivatives and sulfonyloxy derivatives that are prepared by, for example, reacting compounds having hydroxyl group(s) with suitable acyl halide, suitable acid anhydride, suitable sulfonyl chloride, suitable sulfonyl anhydride and mixed anhydride, or with a condensing agent. For example, they include CH3COO, C2H5COO-, tert-BuCOO-, C15H31COO-, PhCOO-, (m-NaOOCPh)COO-, NaOOCCH2CH2COO-, CH3CH(NH2)COO-, CH2N(CH3)2COO-, CH3SO3-, CH3CH2SO3-, CF3SO3-, CH2FSO3-, CF3CH2SO3-, p-CH3O-PhSO3-, PhSO3- and p-CH3PhSO3-.

Starting materials and reaction reagents used in such synthesis are commercially available or can be synthesized according to methods well known in the art using compounds commercially available. Further, extraction, purification and the like may be performed in accordance with the methods carried out in the art.
In the following all steps, when a substituent which impedes a reaction, e.g. hydroxy, mercapto, amino, formyl, carbonyl, carboxy, is possessed, the substituent is protected by the method described in Protective Groups in organic Synthesis, and Theodora W Greene (John Wiley & Sons, hereinafter referred to as literature A) in advance, and the protecting group may be removed at a desirable stage. In addition, in the all steps, an order of steps to be implemented may be appropriately changed, and each intermediate may be isolated, and used in a next step. All of reaction time, reaction temperature, solvents, reagents, protecting groups, etc. are mere exemplification and not limited as long as they do not cause an adverse effect on a reaction.

TEST EXAMPLE 1: The growth inhibition assay using TF-1 cells
To produce the stable cells expressing four types of NT receptors (TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p75) highly and simultaneously, each human NT receptor gene was transfected by a retrovirus vector into human erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 cells (ATCC Number:CRL-2003). The inhibition assay against NGF, BDNF and NT-3 were done in TF-1 cells expressing TrkA+p75, TrkB+p75 and TrkC+p75, respectively. Two hundred nL per well of each compound (final concentration: 20 µmol/L - 0.05 nmol/L) dissolved in DMSO was applied in a white 384 well flat-bottom plate. The cells were suspended in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and seeded in each well at 400 cells for the TF1 cells expressing TrkA and p75 or TrkC and p75, and 800 cells for the TF cells expressing TrkB and p75. Forty µL of human NGF (final concentration: 4 ng/mL), human BDNF (final concentration: 8 ng/mL) or human NT-3 (final concentration: 8 ng/mL) was added in each well and the plate was incubated for 3 days. Then, twenty µL of CellTiter-Glo reagent for CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (manufactured by Promega) was added in each well and chemiluminescence was measured by a microplate reader to evaluate the growth of TF-1 cells. Luminescence value in the well incubated with or without each growth factor is 0% or 100% inhibition, respectively. The inhibitory activity of each compound was calculated by the following formula.<img> id-imgb0764.tif </img>Inhibition %=(1−(luminescence value with compound−luminescence value of 100%inhibitory activity)/(luminescence value of 0% inhibitory activity−luminescencevalue of 100% inhibitory activity))×100
The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined by the logistic regression using the inhibition data in 10 points of 3-fold dilution series at a compound concentration range of 20 µmol/L to 1 nmol/L or 10 points of 3-fold dilution series at a range of 1 µmol/L to 0.05 nmol/L.
TEST EXAMPLE 2: Human TrkA inhibition assay
Seven point five µL per well of human TrkA (PV3144, Lifetechnologies, final concentration: 1 nmol/L) suspended in the assay buffer (100 mmol/L 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 10 mmol/L magnecium chloride, 0.003 vol% Brij-35, 0.004 vol% Tween20 and 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol (DTT)) was applied in a 384 well plate and the plate was pre-incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 0.4 µL of each compound (final concentration: 200 µmol/L - 1 pmol/L) dissolved in DMSO. Then, fluorescent substrate (FL-peptide 27, 760424, PerkinElmer, final concentration: 1.5 µmol/L) and ATP (final concentration 500 µmol/L) dissolved in the assay buffer was added in each well. After the incubation of 120 min at 37°C, fifteen µL of termination buffer (100 mmol/L HEPES, 40 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 10 mmol/L magnecium chloride, 0.003 vol% Brij-35, 0.004 vol% Tween20, 1 mmol/L DTT and 0.16 vol% Coating Reagent 3) was added in each well to stop the enzyme reaction. Fluorescent intensities (FI) of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated fluorescent substrates were measured by LabChip EZReader II (Caliper LifeSciences, Inc.), and conversion ratio (CR) was calculated by the following formula-1. The CR in the well applied with DMSO alone was used as a negative control and the CR in the well without applying TrkA was used as a positive control. The inhibitory effect of each compound on TrkA phosphorylation was calculated by the following formula-2.<img> id-imgb0765.tif </img>CR%=FI of phosphorylated substrate/FI of phosphorylated substrate+FI of non-phosphorylated substrate ×100<img> id-imgb0766.tif </img>Phosphorylation inhibition %=1−CR with compound treatment −CR of positive control/CR of negative control−CR of positive control×100
IC50 values (nmol/L) were determined by the logistic regression using the inhibition data in 10 points of 3-fold dilution series at a compound concentration range of 20 nmol/L to 1 pmol/L, or 10 points of 3-fold dilution series at the range of 2 µmol/L to 0.1 nmol/L, or 10 points of 3-fold dilution series at the range of 200 µmol/L to 10 nmol/L, or 15 points of 3-fold dilution series at the range of 200 µmol/L to 0.04 nmol/L.
