FIELD
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, in particular, relates to a class of substituted pyrimidine compounds as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) δ inhibitor or isomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates or prodrugs thereof, preparation methods of the same and pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and use of these compounds or compositions for treating cancers, tissue proliferative diseases or inflammatory diseases.
BACKGROUND
PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) is a member of the unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases, which is capable of phosphorylating the 3'-OH group on phosphatidylinositols. According to different structures and substrates for phosphorylation, PI3Ks can be divided into three classes: I, II and III, wherein Class I PI3K is a hot spot in the present study. Class I PI3K plays an important role in the regulation of immune cells which have PI3K activity and are helpful for pro-tumourigenic effect of inflammatory cells (Coussens and Werb, Nature, 2002, 420, 860-867), so that it has therapeutic values for the treatment of various forms of cancerous diseases, including solid tumors (such as carcinomas and sarcomas), leukemias and lymphoid malignancies. Class I PI3K consists of p110 unit and p85 unit. At present, there are four known p110 subunits, namely p110α, p110β, p110γ and p110δ, where p110δ mainly occurs in spleen and hematopoietic cells including leukocytes such as T cells, dendritic cells, neutrophils, mast cells, B cells and macrophages. PI3Kδ is fully involved in mammalian immune system functions such as T cell function, dendritic cell function, neutrophil activity, mast cell activation, B cell activation. Thus, PI3Kδ is also involved in a variety of diseases associated with abnormal immune response, such as allergic reactions, inflammatory diseases, inflammation-mediated angiogenesis, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus, asthma, emphysema and other respiratory diseases.
Drug research targeting PI3K pathway has been carried out for many years and has certain clinical success. Particularly, the recent discovery found that selective PI3Kδ inhibitors have a significant effect in the treatment of cancer and other diseases. However, there residue a need to develop superior PI3K inhibitors, particularly selective PI3Kδ inhibitors, to specifically regulate and/or mediate the transduction of PI3K and related protein kinases in order to be used in the treatment of diseases associated with PI3K kinase-mediated events.

Each group was mixed well at room temperature for 10min, and then 5µl of each group was transferred to a 384-well plate.2.2 Kinases were dissolved in 1×kinase buffer to prepare a 2.5×kinase solution. 10µl of 2.5×kinase solution was transferred to the 384-well plate containing compounds of different concentrations. 10µl of 2.5×kinase solution was added to DMSO control group and 10µl of 1×kinase buffer without kinase was added to control group without kinase activity. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 10min.2.3 ATP and the polypeptide labeled with FAM were dissolved in 1×kinase buffer to prepare 2.5×substrate solution.

2. Methods
Cell resuscitation:
The cells were thawed in a 37°C water bath and then transferred to 15ml preheated medium. The cells were centrifuged at 1000rpm for 5min and the medium was discarded. The cells were resuspended in 15ml fresh medium and transferred to T75 culture flask and incubated in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2. The medium was replaced with fresh medium 24h later.
Cell passages:
The resuscitated cells above were transferred to a 50ml sterile centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1000rpm for 5min. The medium was discarded, and the cells were dispersed uniformly and counted. The appropriate cell concentration was adjusted in 15ml fresh medium and added to T75 culture flask. The flask was incubated in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.
When the cells in the T75 culture flask grew to 1×105∼1×106 cells/ml, the cells were resuspended with fresh medium (RPMI-1640 + 20% FBS) and counted. The resuspended cells were adjusted to the following eight concentrations: 1×104 cells/ml, 2×104 cells/ml, 3×104 cells/ml, 5×104 cells/ml, 8×104 cells/ml, 1×105 cells/ml, 1.5x 105 cells/ml, and 2×105 cells/ml. The above cell suspensions were added to 96-well cell culture plate, 100µl each well (1×103 cells/ml, 2×103 cells/ml, 3×103 cells/ml, 5×103 cells/ml, 8×103 cells/ml, 1×104 cells/ml, 1.5×104 cells/ml, and 2×104 cells/ml, respectively). Each concentration was done double in three plates. 72h later, 100µl CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay buffer was added to test wells and shaken gently. 10min later, the Assay plate was attached at the bottom by Backseal membrane and placed on Envison to detect the fluorescence reading. Cell survive (%) was calculated according to the formula: cell survive (%) = (Com-Min)/(Max-Min), wherein Max was the reading of solvent control group, Min was the reading of control group without cells, and Com was the reading of compound treatment group. IC50 was fitted by XLfit processing of the data and results were shown in Table 2.
