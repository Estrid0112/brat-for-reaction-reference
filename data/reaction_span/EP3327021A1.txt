TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, and more particularly, to a compound having high selectivity for Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and a pharmaceutical use thereof.
BACKGROUND ART
T-cells transmit signals received from antigen-presenting cells via T-cell receptors (TCRs) present on surfaces thereof to sub-effectors (effector T-cells) by the activation of a variety of intracellular protein kinases such as Janus kinases (JAKs). In this process, T-cells secrete various interleukins (ILs) or interferon-γ (IFN) to activate various white blood cells and also B-cells. Typical protein kinases involved in signaling in T-cells are four JAK isozymes, i.e., JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), which will be collectively referred to as "Janus kinase" or "JAK" hereinafter.
JAKs have been widely studied as a target for treatment of autoimmune and/or inflammatory diseases. JAK inhibitors have been reported to be useful for the treatment of general symptoms of autoimmune diseases; immune system dysfunctions; viral diseases; and cancers, for example rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, lupus, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, diabetic complications, asthma, autoimmune thyroid disorders, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, leukemia, and organ transplantation or xenograft rejection (Immunol. Rev., 2008, 223(1), 132-142; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 1995, 92(19), 8724-8728; Science, 1995, 270(5237), 800-802; Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 2004, 25(11), 558-562).
Many pharmaceutical companies have competitively studied and developed JAK3 inhibitors with the expectation of developing therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with selective inhibitory activity against JAK3 among JAKs. As a result, recently Pfizer's Xeljanz® (tofacitinib) has received FDA approval as a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis. However, tofacitinib thought to have selective inhibitory activity against JAK3 at the earlier stage of development has now been identified as a pan-JAK inhibitor having general inhibitory activity against the JAK kinase family, raising an ongoing controversial issue regarding that inhibitory activity against which particular JAK isozyme is the most important factor in the efficacy of a therapeutic agent for rheumatoid arthritis.
To sum up the results of a series of recent studies (Cell, 1998, 93(3), 373-383; Immunity, 2000, 13(4), 561-571; Cell, 1998, 93(3), 385-395; Lancet, 2008, 371(9617), 987-997; Chem. Biol., 2011, 18(3), 314-323), it was found that the JAK kinase that is crucial in signaling by T-cell receptors is JAK1, and JAK3 merely plays a limited auxiliary role. Accordingly, in the field of therapeutic agents for autoimmune diseases and/or inflammatory diseases, development of JAK inhibitors is focused on JAK1, not on JAK3, and substances having selective inhibitory activity against JAK1 are being reported one after another (J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55(12), 5901-5921; J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55(13), 6176-6193).
Tofacitinib, which has been identified as a pan-JAK inhibitor, was reported to have side effects, including headache, nausea, diarrhea, infection due to decreased immunity, hyperlipidemia, nasopharyngitis, increased alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), severe anemia, and neutropenia (Mod. Rheumatol., 2013, 23(3), 415-424). On the contrary, filgotinib as a JAK1 selective inhibitor was reported not to have such side effects of tofacitinib (Arthritis Rheum., 2012, 64 (Suppl. 10), 2489). As a result of clinical studies on various drugs known as JAK inhibitors, filgotinib and INCB-039110, as selective JAK1 inhibitors, were reported to have a significantly higher therapeutic limit than other JAK isozyme inhibitors or non-selective inhibitors (Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 2014, 23(8), 1067-1077).
A selective inhibitor of JAK1 is effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Inactivation of JAK2 may induce anemia in animal models since JAK2 is essential in the erythropoietin (EPO) signaling pathway essential for red blood cell production. Accordingly, compounds having a higher enzymatic inhibition rate of JAK1 with respect to JAK2 may exhibit a relatively broad therapeutic index in JAK2-dependent anemia. Therefore, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 over JAK2 is likely to be effective as a therapeutic agent having reduced side effects for rheumatoid arthritis and other immune diseases (J. Med. Chem., 2012, 55(13), 6176-6193).

The compound of Formula 1 or Formula 2 according to one or more embodiments may have an effect of inhibiting the activity of one, two, or more JAK isozymes. Any form of the term "inhibition" used herein may refer to reducing the activity of one, two, or more JAK isozymes.
The "JAK" used herein may include any enzyme in the Janus kinase family. In some embodiments, the compound may inhibit the activity of JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2. In some embodiments, the compound may selectively inhibit the activity of JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2. In some other embodiments, the compound may inhibit the activity of JAK1 only. This JAK inhibitory effect of the compound according to one or more embodiments was confirmed in Test Example 1. The compound according to one or more embodiments exhibited an anti-inflammatory effect in a croton oil-induced inflammation animal model.
The JAK inhibitory effect is measured as the degree to which the convention of ADP to ATP is inhibited in the presence of the compound according to one or more embodiment. When a measured absorbance is under a standard absorption curve, the inhibitory effect may be expressed as a negative value lower than a negative control value, which substantially indicates a 0% inhibition effect having no inhibitory efficacy.
Since the compound of Formula 1 or Formula 2 included in the pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments has JAK inhibitory activity (see Test Example 1), the pharmaceutical composition may be used for the treatment of any disease (hereinafter, referred to as "JAK-related disease") known to be treated using JAK inhibitory activity (Immunol. Rev., 2008, 223(1), 132-142; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 1995, 92(19), 8724-8728; Science, 1995, 270(5237), 800-802; Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 2004, 25(11), 558-562). The JAK-related disease may include an autoimmune disease, an immune system dysfunction, a viral disease, an allergic disease, a skin disease, an IL-6 pathway-related disease, an immune response, a hyperproliferative disorder, or a cancer. The autoimmune disease may include, for example, a skin disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, type I diabetes, lupus, psoriasis, an inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or an autoimmune thyroid disease. The immune system dysfunction may include, for example, an allograft rejection, a graft-versus-host disease, an allograft rejection reaction, or a graft-versus-host reaction. The viral disease may include, for example, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV, HTLV 1, chickenpox, herpes zoster virus (VZV), or human papillomavirus (HPV) disease. The cancer may include, for example, prostate cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, head and neck cancer, glioblastoma, leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. However, embodiments are not limited thereto.
The immune response may be, for example, diarrhea, skin irritation, skin rash, contact dermatitis, or allergic contact hypersensitivity. The allergic disease may be asthma, food allergy, atopic dermatitis, or rhinitis. Examples of the IL-6 pathway-related disease may include Castleman's disease and Kaposi's sarcoma. However, embodiments are not limited thereto.
The compound according to one or more embodiments may selectively inhibit JAK1 relative to JAK2 (see Test Example 1). The expression "selectively" used herein may indicate that a certain compound according to an embodiment has a greater inhibitory effect on a specific JAK than on at least one other JAK. The compound according to one or more embodiments may selectively inhibit JAK1, relative to JAK2, by at least 1 fold or greater, 1.1 fold, 1.2 fold, 5 fold, 10 fold, 20 fold, 40 fold, 100 fold, 200 fold, 500 fold, 1,000 fold or greater, or to infinity (∞). The selective inhibition of JAK1 relative to JAK2 "to infinity" may refer to the inhibition of JAK1 only, while substantially not inhibiting JAK2.
The compound according to one or more embodiments may selectively inhibit JAK1 relative to JAK2, and thus may be used for the treatment of the above-listed JAK-related diseases while relieving or preventing any side effects from inhibition of JAK2. For examples, the side effects which likely occur by the inhibition of JAK2 may include headache, nausea, diarrhea, infection due to decreased immunity, hyperlipidemia, nasopharyngitis, increased alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), severe anemia, and neutropenia. However, embodiments are not limited thereto.
The compound according to one or more embodiments may have a remarkably longer half-life, compared to tofacitinib, which is a conventional, FDA-approved JAK inhibitor, and provide an increased drug dosing interval (see Test Example 3). Accordingly, a pharmaceutical composition including the compound according to one or more embodiments may allow a reduced number of drug doses, and thus improve patient's medication compliance.
The pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments may include a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of Formula 1 or Formula 2, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof, as described above.
In the pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments, the term "therapeutically effective amount" may refer to an amount sufficient to exhibit a therapeutic effect when administered to a subject in need of treatment.
The term "treatment" may refer to treatment of a disease or a medical symptom, for example, a JAK-related disease, in a mammal, including humans, and may include the following: (a) preventing the occurrence of a disease or medical symptom, i.e., prophylactic treatment of a patient; (b) alleviating a disease or medical symptom, i.e., removal or recovery of a disease or medical condition in a patient; (c) suppressing a disease or medical symptom, i.e., slowing or stopping the progression of a disease or medical symptom in a subject; or (d) alleviating a disease or medical symptom in a subject.
The "effective amount" may be properly chosen by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the "effective amount" may be about 0.01 mg to about 10,000 mg, about 0.1 mg to about 1,000 mg, about 1 mg to about 100 mg, about 0.01 mg to about 1,000 mg, about 0.01 mg to about 100 mg, about 0.01 mg to about 10 mg, or about 0.01 mg to about 1 mg.
In the pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments, the compound of Formula 1 or Formula 2 and the pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or stereoisomer thereof may be the same as described above.
The pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments may be administered to various mammals such as rats, mice, livestock, and humans via various routes, for example, an oral route, a rectal route, or an intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intrathecal, or intracerebroventricular injection. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated as pharmaceutical formulations commonly used in the art. The pharmaceutical composition may be formulated as, but not limited to, formulations for oral administration, injections, suppositories, formulations for transdermal administration, and formulations for nasal administration. For example, the pharmaceutical composition may be formulated as formulations for oral administrations such as liquids, suspensions, powders, granules, tablets, capsules, pills, emulsions, syrups, aerosols, or extracts.
In the preparation of each formulation, a pharmaceutically acceptable additive required therefor may be added. For example, when the pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments is formulated as a formulation for oral administration, at least one selected from the group consisting of a diluent, a lubricant, a binder, a disintegrant, a sweetener, a stabilizer, and a preservative may be used as the additive. Optionally, at least one selected from the group consisting of a flavor, a vitamin, and an anti-oxidant may be used.
The additive may be any pharmaceutically acceptable additive. For example, the diluent may be lactose, dextrose, sucrose, corn starch, soybean oil, amorphous cellulose, sorbitol, xylitol, or mannitol. The lubricant may be magnesium stearate or talc. The binder may be polyvinyl pyrrolidine or hydroxypropyl cellulose. The disintegrant may be calcium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium starch glycolate, polacrilin potassium, or crospovidone. The sweetener may be sucrose, fructose, sorbitol, or aspartame. The stabilizer may be sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, β-cyclodextrin, white beeswax, or xanthan gum. The preservative may be methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate, or potassium sorbate.

Among the above-listed formulations, examples of formulations for parenteral administration may include sterilized aqueous solutions, non-aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, lyophilized formulations, and suppositories. To prepare the non-aqueous solutions and suspensions, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils such as olive oil, and injectable esters such as ethyloleate may be used. Bases for the suppositories may include Witepsol, Macrogol, Tween 61, cacao butter, laurin fat, glycerogelatin, or the like.
The pharmaceutical composition according to one or more embodiments may be used in combination with at least one other therapeutic agent used for the treatment of JAK-related diseases. The at least one other therapeutic agent may vary according to a type of the JAK-related disease.

Test Example 1: JAK inhibitory effect
1. In-vitro kinase inhibition test
(1) Dilution of kinase
Human-derived JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2 (Millipore, Germany) were used as kinases. Each kinase was diluted with an appropriate buffer as described below, and then mixed with reaction reagents.
(1.1) Composition of JAK1 dilution buffer
Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) were dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 20 mM and 0.2 mM, respectively, and then, per 100 mL of the solution, 100 µL of β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µL of Brij-35™, and 5 mL glycerol were added, thereby preparing a JAK1 dilution buffer.
(1.2) Composition of JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 dilution buffer
3-morpholinopropane-1-sulfonic acid (MOPS) and EDTA were dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 20 mM and 1 mM, respectively, and then 100 µL of β-mercaptoethanol, 10 µL of Brij-35™, 5 mL of glycerol, and 100 mg of bovine serum albumin (BSA), each per 100 mL of the solution, were added to the solution, thereby preparing a dilution buffer for JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2.

(2.5) IC50 value measurement
Kinase-activity inhibitory effects of some of the compounds of Examples 1 to 48 (for example, Examples 1 and 38) for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 were measured at various concentrations by the above-described method, and IC50 values were determined. The IC50 values of the test compounds were calculated from %inhibition values of the compounds, by the Cheng-Prusoff method (Biochem. Pharmacol., 1973, 22(23), 3099-3108)).
(3) Test results
Tables 5 and 6 show the results of measuring JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 phosphorylation inhibitory levels of the compounds synthesized in Examples 1 to 48, by the above-described method. In Tables 5 and 6, the numbers in the "Example" column, which are identification numbers of the examples, indicate the compounds synthesized in the corresponding examples, the values in the "JAK1", "JAK2", "JAK3", and "TYK2" columns represent kinase-phosphorylation inhibitory levels as a percentage (%) of the compounds synthesized in the corresponding examples at a 1uM concentration. In Tables 5 and 6, negative values substantially indicate no inhibitory effect.
The inhibitory levels (%inhibition) represent a percentage of reduction in phosphorylation activity in each test group with respect to the phosphorylation activity of a corresponding kinase in a negative control group lacking any of the compounds synthesized in the examples.
% inhibition = [(Scintillation value of Test compound non-treatment group - Scintillation value of Test compound treatment group)/(Scintillation value of Test compound non-treatment group)] x100
As the control group, 1uM of tofacitinib citrate (available from Hangzhou Tacon Co., Ltd.) was used. The %inhibition values of the control group for JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 were 99%, 98%, 99%, and 100%, respectively.

Test Example 2: Anti-inflammation test using croton oil-induced inflammation model
(1) Animal
ICR mice (6-week old, male) were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc., and maintained under controlled lighting in a 12-hour light/dark cycle (07:00-19:00). The temperature was maintained at about 22°C, and the mice were allowed free access to feed and drinking water, but were restricted from the feed for 2 hours before administration of the test compound.
(2) Induction of croton oil-induced inflammation (croton oil-induced ear edema)
Croton oil (available from Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. # C6719) as an edema inducer was diluted to about 0.2(v/v)% with acetone (available from Sigma-Aldrich, Cat # 650501). After 30 minutes from the oral administration of a dose of the test compound per body weight of each animal, each animal of the test groups was treated with croton oil by uniformly applying 20 µℓ of the croton oil to the inside and outside of the right ear of each test animal.
(3) Experimental design
Anti-inflammatory efficacy of the compounds according to embodiments was determined using a croton oil-induced mouse animal model. The mice were randomly grouped with 10 mice per group. To determine the anti-inflammatory efficacy of test drugs (compounds), a negative control and each drug were orally administered once 30 minutes before croton oil treatment, as described above in (2). As an excipient of the drugs administered, an aqueous solution of 0.45 v/v% carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (available from Sigma Aldrich, Cat # C5678, 0.5 v/v% in deionized water) and 10 v/v% ethanol in deionized water was used. 1 mL of the excipient (per 100 g of weight) only was administered into the negative control group. For the positive control group, 1 mL of a solution of indomethacin and the excipient (100mg/10mL) was administered per 100 g of body weight (100 mg of indomethacin per 1 kg of body weight). Each test compound was prepared at a concentration of 100mg/10mL, and 1 mL of solution per 100 g of weight was administered (100mg per 1 kg of weight). Indomethacin as a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NASID) family exhibits an efficacy of reducing various inflammation, pains and fevers, and anti-inflammatory efficacy through inhibitory action on cyclooxygenase (COXs).
(4) Evaluation of inflammation (ear edema) model test
The degree of inflammation was determined by measuring the ear thicknesses of experimental animals using a digital outer diameter measuring device (Digimatic micrometer, Mitutoyo Corporation, Japan, Cat # MDC-25SB). The ear thickness measurement was performed after 4 hours from the treatment with croton oil. The thicknesses of a right ear treated with croton oil and a left ear treated with only acetone were measured, and a percentage of thickness increase in the right ear with respect to the thickness of the left ear was calculated. The results are shown in FIGS. 1 and 2.
Test Example 3: Pharmacokinetic Test
After a hydrochloride of the compound of Example 1 was orally or intravenously administered, blood was collected at intervals over 24 hours to analyze a pharmacokinetic profile. The compound of Example 49 (as a hydrochloride of the compound of Example 1) was used, and tofacitinib citrate (approved by EMA) was used as a comparative drug.
A dose of the compound was about 20 mg/kg, which was orally or intraveneously administered one time, followed by blood collection from the jugular veins of three mice at each of blood sampling intervals, i.e., 0, 0.25 (15 min), 0.5 (30 min), 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours from the aminimistration, and measuring a drug concentration. The resulting pharmacokinetic profiles are shown in Table 8.

According to the test results, since the longer the half-life period of a drug, the longer the administration interval becomes, the compound according to an embodiment was found to have a remarkably increased administration interval, compared to conventional tofacitinib, and thus improved patients' medication compliance.
