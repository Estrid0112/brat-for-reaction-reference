TECHNICAL FIELD
The disclosure relates generally to transporters based on polymyxin B and polymyxin B derivatives, in particular guanidinylated derivatives of polymyxin B. Methods of using the transporters for intracellular delivery of cargo are also provided.
BACKGROUND
Polymyxin B is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic containing five primary amines and an eight carbon fatty acid chain, used against Gram-negative bacteria (see, e.g., D. R. Storm, K. S. Rosenthal and P. E. Swanson, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 1977, 46, 723-763). Clinical use of polymyxin has diminished due to observed neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. Recently, however, with the increase in resistant gram-negative infections, the clinical use of polymyxins has been resurrected (see, e.g., M. E. Falagas and S. K. Kasiakou, Clin. Infect. Dis., 2005, 40, 1333-1341; B. Kadar, B. Kocsis, K. Nagy and D. Szabo, Curr. Med. Chem., 2013, 20, 3759-3773; D. Yahav, L. Farbman, L. Leibovici and M. Paul, Clin. Microbiol. Infect., 2012, 18, 18-29; R. L. Nation and J. Li, Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis., 2009, 22, 535-543).
Several biological barriers stand between exogenous agents and their entry to cells and tissues. These barriers hamper the administration of therapeutic agents, limiting their delivery and therapeutic utility. For example, high molecular weight and highly charged biomolecules such as proteins, liposomes, and oligonucleotides display therapeutic potential but have limited cellular uptake, limiting the delivery of these therapeutically active molecules to their intended targets. (see, e.g., R. J. Y. Ho and J. Y. Chien, J. Pharm. Sci., 2012, 101, 2668-2674). Thus, great interest exists in developing molecular transporters as tools for exploring cell entry pathways and for facilitating the delivery of impermeable agents.
SUMMARY
The present disclosure provides derivatives of polymyxin B (PMB) and guanidinylated polymyxin B (GPMB) that can effectively enter mammalian cells and can facilitate the transport and delivery of cargo, such as, e.g., large biomolecules and liposomal assemblies.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Provided herein are transporters based on the antibiotic polymyxin B. In some embodiments, transporters based on polymyxin B (PMB) and guanidinylated polymyxin B (GPMB) effectively enter mammalian cells and facilitate the delivery of cargo, such as, e.g., large biomolecules and liposomal assemblies.
In some embodiments, at nanomolar concentrations, the transporters provided herein can deliver large cargo into living cells. In some embodiments, the cargo has a molecular weight of greater than 300 kDa. Without being bound by any theory, it is believed that uptake of the transporters depends almost exclusively on cell surface heparan sulfate. Investigation of the uptake mechanism indicates these transporters are internalized through caveolae-mediated pathways and confocal microscopy has shown internalization in punctate vesicles that colocalize with the lysosomes. Thus, the transporters, e.g., polymyxin and guanidinopolymyxin derivatives, can be used for intracellular delivery of cargo, e.g., large biomolecules and liposomal assemblies, with potential as a basic research tool and novel drug delivery vehicle.

<img> id-US20180099022A1-20180412-C00006.TIF </img>
where the wavy line represents the point of attachment of the group to the rest of the molecule.
The term “guanidinylated” refers to a compound that has a guanidine moiety attached to it. For example, the term “guanidinylated polymyxin” refers to polymyxin B or a polymyxin B derivative having a guanidine moiety attached to it. For example, R1 is a guanidinium group. In some embodiments, a guanidinylated polymyxin has one, two, three, four, or five guanidinium groups as R1. In some embodiments, one, two, three, four, or five of the R1 groups are guanidinium groups. In some embodiments, every R1 group of the guanidinylated polymyxin is a guanidinium group. In some embodiments, all available positions are guanidinylated. The embodiments of the present disclosure include guanidinylated polymyxin B and polymyxin B derivatives as discussed herein. In some embodiments, these guanidinylated compounds are used as transporters for the uptake of compounds into mammalian cells.
In some embodiments, each R1 is independently selected from among an ammonium group (i.e., -NH3+) and a guanidinium group (i.e., -NH-C(═NH21-NH2).

<img> id-US20180099022A1-20180412-C00007.TIF </img>
where each R1 is independently selected from an ammonium group and a guanidinium group. In some embodiments, each R1 is an ammonium group. In some embodiments, each R1 is a guanidinium group. In some embodiments, the compound of formula (Ia) includes both ammonium groups and guanidinium groups.
While conversion of ammonium groups to guanidinium groups generally enhances cellular uptake rather dramatically, as seen with the conversion of aminoglycosides to guanidinoglycosides, the polymyxin B (PMB) and guanidinopolymyxin B (GPMB) transporters provided herein exhibit similar cellular uptake efficiencies. The cellular uptake of PMB and GPMB remains highly dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate and a fine mechanistic analysis suggests unique internalization pathways. In some embodiments, these transporters show more efficient cytosolic delivery than other well-studied molecular transporters. Additionally, the cyclic peptide, and not the hydrophobic tail, is the entry-facilitating module, which may help explain their adverse cytotoxic effects in mammals.
Certain natural macromolecules, for example the HIV-1 Tat protein, exhibit cellular uptake when added exogenously. Tat efficiently crosses cell membranes and can facilitate the uptake of conjugated or fused cargo. The basic, arginine rich region of the protein has been shown to be critical for uptake. Since these early observations, numerous guanidinium-rich molecular transporters of varying scaffolds have been described and used to deliver a variety of cargo into mammalian cells. The mechanism of cell entry, however, is not fully understood and likely involves multiple pathways and is cargo-dependent. A distinct non-oligomeric yet multivalent family of cellular carriers is the guanidine-glycosides, which are derived from the naturally occurring aminoglycosides in which the ammonium groups are converted to guanidinium groups. A variety of derivatives derived from different aminoglycosides enable uptake of large, bioactive cargo into the lysosomes of cells.
Guanidinium-rich molecular transporters of varying scaffolds have been prepared and used to deliver a variety of cargo into mammalian cells. In some embodiments, the guanidinium-rich scaffold is guanidinylated polymyxin B (GPMB). It is proposed that the positively-charged guanidinium group is able to form bidentate hydrogen bonds with negatively-charged cell surface components such as phosphates, carboxylates, and sulfates. Guanidino-glycosides, for example, show enhanced uptake compared to aminoglycosides and display unique uptake features when compared to other guanidinium-rich transporters by their activity at nanomolar concentrations and dependence on cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans for cellular entry.
Provided herein are high molecular weight biomolecules and nano-assemblies using polymyxin (PMB) and guanidinopolymyxin (GPMB) derivatives as carriers. Unlike the guanidinoglycosides that show substantially enhanced cellular uptake, when compared to their parent aminoglycoside precursors, both PMB and GPMB display highly competent uptake in mammalian cells. While the cellular uptake of PMB and GPMB remains highly dependent on cell surface heparan sulfate, a fine mechanistic analysis suggests unique internalization pathways and more efficient cytosolic delivery than other well-studied molecular transporters. Provided herein are polymyxin and its guanidinylated form that effectively enter mammalian cells. It is the cyclic peptide and not the hydrophobic tail that is the entry-facilitating module. In some embodiments, these molecules can facilitate the cellular delivery of large biomolecules and liposomal assemblies. In some embodiments, the effective entry of parent natural antibiotics into mammalian cells, coupled to earlier observations indicating their ability to interfere with eukaryotic translation, may contribute to their adverse cytotoxic effects in mammals. These observations, in addition to enriching the repertoire of cellular delivery vehicles, illustrate the wide landscape and potential utility of new ammonium and guanidinium rich transporters.
In some embodiments, the transporters provided herein, e.g., compounds of Formula (I), transport large biomolecules, such as proteins and oligonucleotides, and liposomal assemblies into cells. For illustrative purposes, Schemes 1-3 below show the synthesis of biotin derivatives of polymyxin (bPMB) and guanidinylated polymyxin (bGPMB) compounds of Formula (I). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the fatty acyl chain Dab 1 portion of the commercially available PMB can generate the polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN). PMBN can be either boc-protected or boc-protected and guanidinylated before coupling to the biotin linker. The linker can be formed by a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of an alkyne portion and an azide-containing biotinylated linker. The enzymatically cleaved Dab residue will be reintroduced as part of the linker by amide bond formation to hexynoic acid so the final product will be similar to the natural PMB scaffold containing five Dab moieties (and the same number of primary amines). The transporter can then be conjugated to the fluorescently tagged protein streptavidin, which does not enter cells on its own.
In some embodiments, PMB and its guanidinylated form GPMB are utilized to deliver cargo into mammalian cells. In some embodiments, the cargo is a protein. In some embodiments, the cargo is a toxin. In some embodiments, PMB and its guanidinylated form GPMB can be utilized in the delivery of liposomes into mammalian cells.
In some embodiments, provided are compounds of Formula (I) that are functionalized derivatives of the antibiotic polymyxin B and its guanidinylated derivative that facilitate uptake of the antibiotic into mammalian cells. In some embodiments, the compounds of Formula (I) can be used as molecular transporters. In some embodiments, at nanomolar concentrations, the compounds of Formula (I) are capable of delivering large cargo, e.g., large biomolecules, such as proteins and oligonucleotides, and liposomal assemblies, into living cells. In some embodiments, the liposomal assemblies contain cargo. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is compound 4a. In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) is compound 4b.
In some embodiments, the compound of Formula (I) can be incorporated into liposomes and enhance their intracellular uptake. In some embodiments, the natural polymyxin scaffold enhances intracellular uptake. In some embodiments, the liposomes contain cargo.

Octaarginine (bArg8)
bArg8 was synthesized using standard solid phase peptide synthesis protocols (Rink amide resin). An aminohexanoic acid (Ahx) spacer was introduced in the N-terminus and biotin-NHS (4 eq) was coupled to the peptide's N-terminus over 1 h at rt in DMF containing DIEA (8 eq). The peptide was cleaved from the resin using TFA/TIS/water (95:2.5:2.5) at rt for 3 h. The resin was filtered off and the peptide precipitated by the addition of cold ether and further standing at 4 degrees overnight. The crude was purified by HPLC using a semiprep RP-C18 column [5-60% ACN (0.1% TFA) in H2O (0.1% TFA) over 9 min].

Formation of Biotin-Streptavidin Complexes
Biotinylated transporters allow conjugation of the carriers to fluorescent proteins and the ability to test a variety of analogs in different assays (see, e.g., J. M. Hyman, E. I. Geihe, B. M. Trantow, B. Parvin and P. A. Wender, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2012, 109, 13225-13230; S. Console, C. Marty, C. Garcia-Echeverria, R. Schwendener and K. Ballmer-Hofer, J. Biol. Chem., 2003, 278, 35109-35114; G. Gasparini and S. Matile, Chemical Communications, 2015, 51, 17160-17162; J. Fu, C. Yu, L. Li and S. Q. Yao, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2015, 137, 12153-12160). Biotin compounds were incubated in a 5:1 molar ratio with streptavidin derivatives for 20 min at room temperature. Conjugates were then diluted in culture medium to the final streptavidin concentration. Streptavidin conjugated to R-phycoerythrin (PE) coupled to the cyanine dye Cy5 (ST-PE-Cy5) was used as a high molecular weight model protein (MW=300 kDa), streptavidin-Cy5 (ST-Cy5) was used for microscopy experiments, and streptavidin-saporin was used to analyze cytosolic delivery.

Cellular Uptake and Cell Surface Binding in Wild Type and Heparan Sulfate-Deficient CHO Cells
Cell Culture
Wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61). Mutant pgsA745 and pgsD677 were described previously (see, e.g., P. Pristovsek and J. Kidric, J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, 4604-4613; M. Vaara, Microbiol. Rev., 1992, 56, 395-411). All cells were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. CHO-K1, pgsA, and pgsD cells were grown in F-12 medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v, Gemini Bio-Products) and penicillin/streptomycin solution (1% v/v). The Hep3B cell line was obtained from ATCC (HB-8064) and cultured in MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
Quantifying Cellular Uptake/Binding
The polymyxin derivatives (2.5 μM in PBS) were incubated with ST-PE-Cy5 (0.5 μM in PBS) for 20 min at ambient temperature then diluted with F-12 cell culture medium to give final conjugate solutions.
Cells were plated onto 24-well plates (100 000 cells/well) and grown for 24 h to about 80% confluence. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 300 μL of the corresponding conjugate for 1 h at 37 ° C. under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were washed twice with PBS, detached with 50 μL of trypsin-EDTA for uptake studies or 100 μL Versene (EDTA) for binding studies, diluted with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, and analyzed by FACS. Cellular uptake was quantified by the mean fluorescence intensity; raw data was interpreted by using FlowJo v8.8.6.
Wild type CHO-K1 cells were incubated with the carrier-ST-PE-Cy5 conjugate for 1 h at 37° C., detached with trypsin/EDTA, and analyzed by flow cytometry (see, e.g., H. O'Dowd, B. Kim, P. Margolis, W. Wang, C. Wu, S. L. Lopez and J. Blais, Tetrahedron Lett., 2007, 48, 2003-2005). Uptake of the fluorescent conjugate occurred at concentrations as low as 2 nM and increased in a dose dependent manner (FIG. 1A). bGTob showed uptake behavior similar to bPMB and bGPMB whereas bTob exhibited a ten-fold reduction in uptake. bArg8 showed approximately three-fold higher uptake than bPMB and bGPMB. Similar uptake patterns for bPMB and bGPMB were also observed in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 and the human hepatocyte cell line HEP-3B. Cellular uptake of GPMB and PMB conjugated to ST-PE-Cy5 was measured in CHO-K1, HEK-293, and HEP-3B cells. The cells were incubated with conjugate (5 nM) at 37° C. for 1 h. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry. The background signal from untreated cells was subtracted (FIG. 2).
Cell-Titer Blue assays indicated that bPMB and bGPMB showed no cytotoxicity when incubated with either CHO-K1 or HEK-293 cell lines for 72 h at concentrations as high as 0.5 μM. CHO-K1 cells (FIG. 3A) and HEK-293 cells (FIG. 3B) were incubated with various concentrations of GPMB-biotin or PMB-biotin in complete media for 72 hours in a 96-well plate. Cell titer blue was added and incubated an additional 4 hours. Cell viability was calculated by measuring the fluorescence intensity at 560/590.
To demonstrate that the formation of a stable biotin-streptavidin complex was necessary for cellular delivery, ST-PE-Cy5 was incubated with bPMB, bGPMB, or PMB or GPMB (which do not contain the biotin moiety), then diluted to the desired final ST-PE-Cy5 concentrations. The mixtures were then added to CHO-K1 cells and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured by flow cytometry and the background signal from untreated cells was subtracted. No enhanced uptake of ST-PE-Cy5 in the absence of the biotin-linked transporter was observed (FIG. 4).
The dependence of bPMB and bGPMB on cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans for cellular entry was evaluated using two mutant CHO cell lines, pgsA-745 which does not express HS or chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS), and pgsD-677 which does not express HS but expresses 2- to 3-fold higher levels of CS/DS. bGPMB and bPMB streptavidin-PE-Cy5 conjugates conjugates (5 nM) were incubated with WT and mutant CHO cell lines for 1 h at 37° C. then lifted with EDTA/trypsin. Uptake in HS-deficient cell lines was reduced to <20% of that observed in wild-type cells (FIG. 1B).
To investigate cell-surface binding, CHO-K1 cells and pgsA-745 cells were incubated with 5 nM bGPMB and bPMB streptavidin-PE-Cy5 conjugates at 37° C. for 1 h and harvested using EDTA to prevent cleavage of cell-surface bound compounds. Cells were lifted with EDTA only (binding+uptake) or EDTA/trypsin (uptake). Binding values were determined by subtracting the MFI values obtained for cells lifted with EDTA/trypsin from those obtained for cells lifted with EDTA only. The fluorescence signal was compared to that observed when cells were lifted with EDTA/trypsin, which removes cell surface proteoglycans. For both bPMB and bGPMB, binding accounted for about 15% of the signal (FIG. 1C). Greater binding was observed in CHO-K1 cells compared to mutant pgsA-745 cells for both transporters (FIG. 1C).
Example 4
Mechanisms of Uptake
Cells were grown for 24 h in 24-well plates as described above. Cells were incubated at 4° C. for 15 min in F-12, washed with cold PBS, then incubated with the precooled conjugate solution for 30 min at 4° C. Cells were washed, detached with trypsin-EDTA, and analyzed as described above.
Cells were grown for 24 h in 24-well plates as described above, washed with PBS, and incubated with 5 mM amiloride for 10 min or 400 mM sucrose, 20 μM chlorpromazine, 200 μM genistein, or 5 μM nystatin for 30 min at 37° C. Cells were then washed with PBS and treated with the conjugate solution in F-12 for the cells pre-treated with amiloride, or the conjugate solution in the presence of the inhibitor, using the same concentration used for pre-treatment, for 1 h at 37° C. under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were washed, detached with trypsin-EDTA, and analyzed as described above.
To shed light on the internalization mechanism(s), the contribution of various endocytotic pathways was evaluated pharmacologically. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with streptavidin-PE-Cy5 bPMB or bGPMB conjugates (5 nM) at 4° C. to assess the contribution of energy-dependent processes. Further, uptake was evaluated in cells pretreated with inhibitors of macropinocytosis (amiloride), clathrin-mediated endocytosis (sucrose and chlorpromazine) or caveolae-mediated endocytosis (genistein and nystatin) (FIG. 1D). For inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with amiloride (Am, 10 min, 5 mM), sucrose (Suc, 30 min, 400 mM), chlorpromazine (CPZ, 30 min, 20 μM), genistein (Gen, 30 min, 200 μM), or nystatin (Nys, 30 min, 5 μM) at 37° C. prior to incubation with the conjugates (5 nM) for 1 h at 37° C. in the presence of inhibitor (except Am). The MFI was normalized.
The inhibitory effect on the uptake of bGTob was also evaluated for comparison. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with GTob conjugated to streptavidin-PE-Cy5 (5 nM) for 1 h at 37° C. or 4° C. For inhibition experiments, cells were pretreated with amiloride (Am, 10 min, 5 mM), sucrose (Suc, 30 min, 400 mM), chlorpromazine (CPZ, 30 min, 20 μM), genistein (Gen, 30 min, 200 μM), or nystatin (Nys, 30 min, 5 μM) at 37° C. prior to incubation with the conjugates (5 nM) for 1 h at 37° C. in the presence of inhibitor (except Am). The background signal from untreated cells was subtracted and the MFI was normalized. While low temperature practically abolished internalization of the streptavidin-PE-Cy5 bPMB or bGPMB conjugates, treatment with amiloride, sucrose or chlorpromazine did not affect the cellular uptake of bPMB or bGPMB high MW conjugates. However, in cells treated with either genistein or nystatin, cellular uptake was reduced by ˜50-60%, indicating that bPMB and bGPMB conjugates internalize through energy-dependent processes, presumably through caveolae-mediated pathways. bGTob, on the other hand, showed reduced uptake in the presence of sucrose, chlorpromazine and genistein and no change in uptake when cells were treated with amiloride or nystatin (FIG. 5), indicating a different mechanism of uptake.
Example 5
Intracellular Localization
CHO-K1 cells were grown for 24 h in 35 mm dishes equipped with a glass bottom coverslip coated with poly-D-lysine. Cells were washed with PBS, treated with 1.5 mL of transporter conjugated to ST-Cy5 (20 nM) and incubated at 37° C. for 1 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with Hoescht stain and LysoTracker. Images were processed and analyzed using Nikon Imaging Software Elements and ImageJ. Pearson's correlations were calculated for individual cells in three separate images from two different experiments and then averaged (n=30).
To learn about the intracellular localization of these transporters, wild type CHO-K1 cells were incubated with GPMB (FIG. 6A, top panel) or PMB (FIG. 6A, bottom panel) conjugated to streptavidin-Cy5 (20 nM) for 1 h at 37° C. and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Cells were further treated with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 (FIG. 6C) and the lysosomal marker LysoTracker Green DND-26 (FIG. 6B). The images show transporter accumulation in punctate vesicles. Overlaying the images from the green and far red (pseudo-colored in red) channels revealed a moderate degree of co-localization for the conjugates and LysoTracker-stained compartments, resulting in a Pearson's correlation of 0.62 for both bPMB and bGPMB. The cellular uptake of ST-Cy5 was analyzed. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with PMB or GPMB conjugated to streptavidin-PE-Cy5 at various concentrations for 1 h at 37° C. Mean fluorescence intensity was measured and the background signal from untreated cells was subtracted. FACS analyses of carrier-ST-Cy5 conjugates up to 20 nM (FIG. 7) were consistent with ST-PE-Cy5 delivery.

Cytoplasmic Delivery
The biotinylated transporters were incubated with ST-Sap in a 5:1 molar ratio for 20 min at ambient temperature then diluted with F-12 cell culture medium to give final conjugate solutions. CHO-K1 and pgsA cells were incubated with 100 μL of the corresponding conjugate for 4 days at 37° C. under an atmosphere of 5% CO2. CellTiter-Blue (20 μL) was added to the medium and incubated for an additional 4 h to measure viability.
The ability of bPMB and bGPMB to deliver cargo to the cytosol was evaluated by conjugating the transporter to streptavidin-saporin (ST-SAP) and incubating the conjugate with CHO-K1 or pgsA cells at various concentrations. CHO-K1 cells were incubated with transporter-streptavidin-saporin conjugates at 37° C. After four days, the CellTiter-Blue assay was used to assess the number of viable cells and fluorescence intensity was measured at 560/590. bPMB and bGPMB had LD50 values of 3.1 nM and 3.3 nM respectively, while bGTob had an LD50 value of 13.2 nM and bArg8 had an LD50 value of 3.1 nM (FIG. 8).
Additionally, ST-SAP without transporter or saporin without streptavidin incubated with bPMB and bGPMB were unable to induce cell death, indicating the need of forming the biotin-ST complex. ST-SAP-transporter conjugates showed no toxicity in pgsA cells. Saporin (no streptavidin) was incubated with bPMB or bGPMB for 20 min then diluted to final saporin concentrations and added to CHO-K1 cells. After four days, the number of viable cells was determined using CellTiter-Blue assay and the fluorescence intensity at was measured at 560/590 (FIG. 9A). pgsA cells were incubated with transporter-streptavidin-saporin conjugates at 37° C. After four days, the number of viable cells was determined using CellTiter-Blue and fluorescence intensity was measured at 560/590 (FIG. 9B).

Cellular Uptake of bPMB and bGPMB Modified Liposomes
A mixture (30 mg total) of DOPC, DOPE, and cholesterol (73:11:16) was dissolved in chloroform to a final volume of 1 mL and evaporated in a round flask and further dried under high vacuum overnight to form a thin lipid layer. The resulting film was hydrated for 15 min at 37° C. with 1 mL of PBS containing 100 μM Cy5. The mixture was sonicated for 30 s, subjected to six freeze/thaw cycles using a dry ice/acetone bath and a water bath at 37° C. Lastly, the suspension was extruded 17 times through a polycarbonate membrane (pore size 100 nm) at room temperature. Non-encapsulated dye was removed by gravitational gel filtration (Sephadex G-50). Lipid concentration was determined adapting the Stewart method. Liposomes were diluted to 3 mg/mL and used as is (plain liposomes) or mixed with 10 mol % PMB or GPMB for 1 h at room temperature. Unincorporated PMB or GPMB was removed via centrifuge gel filtration (Sephadex G-50) (see, e.g., D. W. Fry, J. C. White and I. D. Goldman, Anal. Biochem., 1978, 90, 809-815).
To examine the significance of the cyclic peptide as a delivery module, rather than the lipophilic tail, and the versatility of PMB and GPMB as transporters, liposomes containing the fluorescent Cy5 dye were mixed with 10 mol % PMB or GPMB. Uptake was evaluated using flow cytometry and the size and zeta potential of the liposomes were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and are shown in Table 1 below. Size, polydispersity, and zeta-potential of evaluated liposomes are shown. Plain liposomes were compared to liposomes mixed with 10 mol % GPMB or 10 mol % PMB.

CHO-K1 cells were incubated with plain and PMB or GPMB decorated liposomes at 0.30, 0.50, or 0.70 μg/mL for 1 h at 37° C. The background signal from untreated cells was subtracted and the MFI was normalized. Both carriers showed the ability to enhance delivery of cargo containing liposomes into wild-type CHO cells with similar efficacy (FIG. 10).
