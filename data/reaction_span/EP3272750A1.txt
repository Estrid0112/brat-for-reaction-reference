Technical Field
The present invention relates to a morphinan derivative having an opioid δ receptor agonistic activity.
Background Art
Opioids bind to opioid receptors to exhibit the effect thereof, and there are three kinds of subtypes of the opioid receptors, i.e., µ, δ, and κ receptors. It is known that agonists of each of the three subtypes, i.e., µ, δ, and κ, have analgesic effects.
However, although morphine, an agonist of the opioid µ receptor showing a high affinity to the receptor, has a potent analgesic effect, it also shows adverse effects such as dependence, drug abuse, tolerance, respiratory depression, constipation caused by suppression of gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting, blood pressure reductions, bradycardia, cough reflex inhibition, and sleepiness.
Although eptazocine, a selective agonist of the opioid κ receptor, has a potent analgesic effect, and shows mild dependence, tolerance, sleepiness, constipation, and respiratory depression, it causes sweating, nausea and vomiting, and thirst.
It is also known that activation of the opioid δ receptor provides analgesic, antidepressive, and anxiolytic effects. For example, it is known that enkephalin, an endogenous ligand of the opioid δ receptor, has an analgesic effect. There are also known that anxiety-like behaviors and depression-like behaviors increase in opioid δ receptor-deficient mice (Non-patent document 1), and enhancement of the enkephalin-δ receptor system is related to emotion regulation (Non-patent document 2). Further, since the antidepressive and anxiolytic-like-effects of various δ receptor agonists are antagonized by a δ receptor antagonist in various rat and mouse anxiety and depression models, usefulness of δ receptor-selective agonists as antidepressive and anxiolytic drugs have been demonstrated (Non-patent documents 3 to 7, Patent documents 1 and 2). It is expected that an agonist that selectively activates the opioid δ receptor does not show or scarcely shows adverse effects that are induced through activation of the opioid µ receptor or opioid κ receptor.
In addition, it is suggested that activation of the δ receptor shows effects for improving neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, ischaemia or cerebral stroke, urinary dysfunction, HIV infection, alcohol dependence, diabetes, and the like (Non-patent document 8). Various compounds have so far been reported as opioid δ agonists, and analgesic effects, antidepressive effects, and anxiolytic effects thereof have been verified (Patent documents 1 to 6, Non-patent document 9). It has also been reported that some opioid δ agonists such as SNC80 and BW373U86 induce convulsion (Non-patent documents 5, 6, and 10).
As antidepressants, tetracyclic antidepressants and triazolopyridine type antidepressants have been developed in addition to the classic tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and in recent years, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), and noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants (NaSSA) are frequently used. However, effectiveness of all these antidepressants is not so high as evaluated in terms of remission rate. Usefulness thereof is also limitative, because of early development of increased aggression after start of administration, risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt of youth age patients, and the like.
As anxiolytic drugs, although benzodiazepine type drugs are widely used, this type of drugs have outstanding problems, for example, difficulty in use for elderly people and patients showing a bad general state, because of adverse effects of them such as dependence, hypnotic action, muscle relaxation, sedation, and cognitive function decline at regular dose. Although indications of SSRI and SNRI developed as antidepressants are recently expanded to various anxiety disorders, they do not show immediate effects, and also show adverse effects. Although anesthetic drugs such as barbiturate also show anxiolytic effects, effective dose and fatal dose thereof are close to each other, and therefore they are drugs having risks.
Therefore, it is desired to develop an anxiolytic and an antidepressant that show effects thereof through a mechanism different from those of the presently used drugs, and show improved adverse effects and safety.

Effect of the Invention
The compounds represented by the general formula (I), tautomers or stereoisomers of the compounds, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and solvates thereof, which are the compounds provided by the present invention, exhibit potent agonistic activity for the opioid δ receptor, but do not activate or only extremely weakly activate the µ and κ receptors, and therefore they have superior antidepressive effects, anxiolytic effects, analgesic effects, therapeutic effects for Parkinson's disease, and therapeutic effects for pollakiuria and urinary incontinence based on activation of the opioid δ receptor. Since the compounds of the present invention do not activate or only extremely weakly activate the µ and κ receptors, they do not provide or extremely weakly provide adverse effects such as dependence, drug abuse, tolerance, respiratory depression, constipation caused by suppression of gastrointestinal motility, nausea and vomiting, blood pressure reductions, bradycardia, cough reflex inhibition, sleepiness, sweating, and thirst. As far as the inventors of the present invention examined, the compounds of the present invention do not act on or extremely weakly act on other receptors, channels, and enzymes. Therefore, it is expected that the compounds of the present invention do not show at all or extremely weakly show adverse effects such as convulsion, muscle relaxation, sedation, and cognitive function decline.
Since high blood concentration and enhanced migration into the brain of the compounds of the present invention are achieved by oral administration or administration by injection (for example, subcutaneous injection), they can be used by oral administration or administration by injection.
Since the compounds of the present invention are hardly metabolized in the microsomes derived from hepatocytes, they are advantageous from the viewpoint of drug metabolism. They impose little risk of adverse effects caused by metabolic products, either.
The compounds of the present invention do not show at all any inhibitory activity against Kv11.1 (or hERG, human ether-a-go-go related gene), which is the potassium ion channel responsible to the repolarization of myocardial action potential, or show such an inhibitory activity at an ignorable level, and therefore they are safe drugs in respect of risk of sudden death caused by prolongation of the QT interval.
The compounds of the present invention are highly effective and safe medicaments.
The compounds of the present invention can simultaneously eliminate all of depression, anxiety, and pain as a single medicament.

Opioid receptor function test
The functional activities of the compounds provided by the present invention on the µ, δ, and κ opioid receptors were investigated.
Method:
The test was performed by using Lance Ultra cAMP Kit (PerkinElmer) according to a method predetermined for the kit. In the evaluation of the agonistic activity, CHO cells expressing each of the human opioid receptors (δ, µ, and κ, accession numbers and catalog numbers are mentioned below) and 10 µM of each test compound were reacted for 30 minutes in an assay buffer (1 x HBSS, 1 M HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mM IBMX (isobutylmethylxanthine), 7.5% BSA) in the presence of forskolin. Subsequently, the cAMP detection reagent included in the kit was added, and 1 hour afterward, time-resolved fluorescence measurement was performed by using the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer). The test compounds and the control drugs (8: SNC80, µ: DAMGO, κ: U-69593) were evaluated in a concentration range of 10-12 to 10-5 M, a dose-response curve of each test compound was obtained from the fluorescence values at 665 nm, and EC50 value and the Emax value were calculated. The Emax value was calculated as a ratio of the maximum reaction of the test compound to the maximum reaction of each control drug, which is taken as 100%.

Mouse elevated plus maze test
(Test method)
For the test, 5 to 6 weeks old C57BL/6N male mice were used. On a plus maze apparatus consisting of a wall-less running route (open arm, width 6 cm, length 30 cm) and a running route with a wall (closed arm, width 6 cm, length 30 cm, height of wall 15 cm), and having a height of 40 cm, a mouse was put so as to be directed to the running route with a wall, and allowed to spontaneously enter into the plus maze. Each test substance was dissolved in saline or 0.005 N HCl in saline, and subcutaneously administered on the back 30 minutes before the start of the test. At the time of the start of the test, video recording with a video camera was started, the time at which the mouse entered into the plus maze is considered to be the start of the test, and exploratory behavior was recorded for 5 minutes. On the basis of the video image, staying time in the running routes were determined, and wall-less running route staying time ratio (%) was calculated.
(Test results)
As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, from this experiment, it was found that subcutaneous administrations of the compound 1 (the compound described in Example 1) and the compound 7 (the compound described in Example 7) at a dose of 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively, significantly increased the wall-less running route staying time ratio and thus it was confirmed that they exhibit anxiolytic-like effects. The compound 3 (the compound described in Example 3), the compound 9 (the compound described in Example 9), and the compound 10 (the compound described in Example 10) also showed a tendency of increasing the wall-less running route staying time ratio (Figs. 3 to 5).
Example 42
Rat elevated plus maze test
Anxiolytic effects of the compounds provided by the present invention were investigated by the rat elevated plus maze test.
(Test method)
For the test, 7 to 9 weeks old Wistar male rats were used. On a plus maze apparatus consisting of a wall-less running route (width 10 cm, length 50 cm) and a running route with a wall (width 10 cm, length 50 cm, height of wall 30 cm), and having a height of 50 cm, a rat was put so as to be directed to the running route with a wall, and allowed to spontaneously enter into the plus maze, and exploratory behavior was observed for 5 minutes. Each test substance was dissolved in a 4.5% aqueous solution of cyclodextrin, and orally administered 2 hours before the start of the test. The test data were automatically analyzed by using video image action analysis software (Smart3.0, PanLab S.L., PanLab), and wall-less running route staying time ratio (%) was calculated.
(Test results)
As shown in Fig. 6, from this experiment, it was found that oral administration of 3 mg/kg of each of the compound 7 (the compound described in Example 7), the compound 3 (the compound described in Example 3), and the compound 10 (the compound described in Example 10) significantly increased the wall-less running route staying time ratio, and thus it was confirmed that they exhibit anxiolytic-like effects.

hERG (human ether-a-go-go-related gene) potassium channel inhibition test
(Test method)
The test was performed with Port-a-Patch automatic patch clump apparatus (Nanion Technologies) using hERG channel-stably expressing CHO cells (purchased from Channelopathy Foundation). The membrane potential of the cells was maintained at -80 mV, then there were applied a depolarization pulse at +20 mV for 1.5 seconds, and a following test pulse at -50 mV for 1.5 seconds at a frequency of 1 time per 10 seconds, and the hERG current was confirmed as a tail current induced by the test pulse. The test compound was dissolved in an extracellular fluid (137 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM D(+)-glucose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and the solution was refluxed at room temperature for 5 minutes. The inhibition ratio was obtained from the ratio of the tail current value observed after the compound was applied based on the tail current value observed before the compound was applied, which was taken as 100%. For the test, we used cells that showed a peak tail current value not smaller than 300 pA, tail current run-down smaller than 10% of the initial current value, and leak current smaller than 200 pA.
(Test results)
The test results are shown in Table 7.
In the table, the compounds 1, 3, 7, 9, and 10 are the compounds described in Examples 1, 3, 7, 9, and 10, respectively.
As clearly seen from the results shown in Table 7, all the test compounds showed only weak inhibitory effects.
On the other hand, it was revealed that the compounds disclosed inWO2013/35833 (Patent document 4) include those having potent hERG inhibitory effects.

Hyperemotional reaction inhibition test using olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) rat
(Test method)
According to the method of Saitoh et al. (Saitoh A, Yamada M, Yamada M, Takahashi K, Yamaguchi K, Murasawa H, Nakatani A, Tatsumi Y, Hirose N, and Kamei J: Antidepressant-like effects of the delta-opioid receptor agonist SNC80 ((+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-[(2S,5R)-2,5-dimethyl-4-(2-propenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-(3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide) in an olfactory bulbectomized rat model, Brain Res., 2008, 1208:160-169), OBX rats were prepared by extracting the rat olfactory bulbs, and then breeding the rats in an isolated circumstance. Hyperemotional reaction was evaluated on the day 14 after the surgical operation and before the division into groups, and 2 hours after the administration on the days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 14 of the administration period according to the hyperemotional reaction evaluation criteria prepared by Gomita et al. (Gomita et al., Behavioral pharmacological and electroencephalographical studies of 7-chloro-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-1,5-benzodiazepine-2,4-(3H,5H:)-dione (Clobazam), Folia Pharmacologica Japonica, 82, 267 (1983)). The drug was subcutaneously administered once a day continuously over 14 days. As a positive control drug, fluoxetine, which is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), was used. As the solvent, a 1% cyclodextrin (CD) was used.
(Test results)
Administration of 0.1 mg/kg of the test substance (the compound described in Example 7 mentioned above) significantly reduced the hyperemotional reactions of the OBX rats from the day 4 of the administration period compared with the solvent administration group, and restored the condition even to a level comparable to that of the rats of the sham surgery group on the day 7 of the administration period. Administration of 1 mg/kg of the test substance significantly reduced the hyperemotional reactions of the OBX rats from the day 1 of the administration period compared with the solvent administration group, and restored the condition even to a level comparable to that of the rats of the sham surgery group on the day 4 of the administration period. These effects were maintained until the day 14. On the other hand, administration of fluoxetine at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced the hyperemotional reactions of the OBX rats on the day 14 of the administration period compared with the solvent administration group.
From the above investigation, it was suggested that the test substance may possibly show antidepressant-like effects even with single administration, unlike SSRI. It was also suggested that tolerance may not be induced for the antidepressant-like action of the test substance.

Reserpine-induced Parkinson's disease model mouse
(Test method)
ICR male mice (5 weeks old, Japan SLC) were obtained, and used after an acclimation period (5 to 12 days).
PD model was prepared with reference to the report of Hille et al. (Exp. Neurol., 2001, 172:189). It was prepared by intraperitoneally administering reserpine (5 mg/kg) 18 to 24 hours before the start of the test. The test was performed by subcutaneously administering a test compound to each mouse on the day of the test, immediately putting the mouse into a cage for monitoring locomotor activity, and measuring the migration distance over 60 minutes.
(Test results)
Since administration of the test substance (the compound described in Example 7 mentioned above) at 10 mg/kg significantly increased exploratory behavior, and also, a tendency of increase of standing up behavior was found, although it was not significant (P = 0.16), Parkinson's disease-curing effect of the test substance was suggested.
Example 46
Evaluation using rat cerebral infarction-induced overactive bladder model
(Test method)
A transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model was prepared by using 8 weeks old SD male rats under isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. On the next day, the cervix was slightly cut open again under the isoflurane inhalation anesthesia, and a catheter for administration was fixed in the jugular vein, and led to the back. A cystometry operation was also performed, and the other end of a cannula inserted into the bladder was led to the back, and connected to a cannula swivel.
On the day 4 after the cerebral ischemia operation, cystometry was performed under no anesthesia and with no restraint. Intravesical pressure was measured for the stable period, then a medium was intravenously administered, and the value of the pressure was measured over about 30 minutes as a value before test substance administration. Then, the test substance was cumulatively and intravenously administered from the lowest dose at intervals of about 30 minutes, and the value was measured for about 30 minutes after each administration. For the rats determined to show pollakiuria (urination interval was 10 minutes or shorter) in the measurement before the administration, static intravesical pressure, pressure at the time of urination, urination interval, and single urination amount were measured at each time point.
(Test results)
The measurement results are shown in Table 8.
As clearly seen from the results shown in Table 8, the test substance (the compound described in Example 7 mentioned above) did not affect the static intravesical pressure and pressure at the time of urination at all the doses. On the other hand, the urination interval and single urination amount showed a dose-dependently increasing tendency, and therefore pollakiuria-improving action of the test substance was suggested.

Metabolic stability test
(Test method)
Human hepatic microsomes and a test substance were reacted for a certain period of time (0 to 60 minutes). The test substance, which was not metabolized in the reaction sample, was measured, and remaining ratio was calculated. The test substance-remaining ratio at the time when the reaction time is 0 hour is taken as 100%. The remaining ratio after incubation was plotted against time as a log-linear plot to obtain a regression line (y = 100e-kt, k = inclination of straight line: clearance rate constant), and metabolic clearance CLint (mL/min/kg) was calculated by using the following equation. CLint*=k−min×52.5 mg MS protein/g liver×26 g liver/kg/MS protein (mg MSprotein/mL) *: Davies, B. and Morris T., Physiological parameters in laboratory animals and humans, Pharm.
