TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to a novel diamine compound and an organic electroluminescent element using the same.
BACKGROUND
Recently, organic electroluminescent elements (OLED) have drawn attention due to their properties of self-emitting, low driving voltage, high efficiency, high luminance, light weight, thinness, and broad color gamut. Development of novel organic materials has gained more attention, in order to satisfy the applications of organic electroluminescent elements.
Most amine compounds, which have been mainly used in optical conductors in xerography, have a very high hole mobility of about 10−3 cm/Vs, such that they can be used as hole transport materials, host materials or fluorescent materials in organic electroluminescent elements.
The use of conventional blue fluorescent materials, such as simple small organic molecules, for example, derivatives of anthracene, carbazole, and coumarin, in organic electroluminescent elements has been known broadly. However, problems, such as photochromic impurity, poor luminous efficiency, and short operational life are commonly faced by the conventional fluorescent materials used in organic electroluminescent elements.
Therefore, there is continuous need for novel luminescent materials, particularly fluorescent materials emitting blue light.
SUMMARY

EXAMPLE 1
Manufacture of an Organic Luminescent Element Emitting Blue Light
A substrate was washed with a solvent and ozone under UV light for degreasing, prior to loading the substrate in an evaporation system for use. Thereafter, the substrate was transferred in a vacuum deposition chamber, and all of the layers were deposited on the top of the substrate. The layers shown in FIG. 2 were deposited sequentially at a vacuum of about 10−6 Torr using a heated evaporation boat as following:a) an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer;b) a hole injection layer with a thickness of 20 nm, HAT-CN;c) a hole transport layer with a thickness of 60 nm, HT;d) a light emitting layer with a thickness of 30 nm, containing 3 wt % of Compound A2 as a guest emitter and BH1 as a host emitter (BH1 is a product name of E-ray Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd.);e) an electron transport layer with a thickness of 25 nm, containing ET and doped lithium quinolinate (Liq);f) an electron injection layer with a thickness of 1 nm, lithium fluoride (LiF); andg) a cathode with a thickness of 150 nm, containing aluminum (Al).
The structure of the element of Example 1 can be represented as: ITO/HAT-CN (20 nm)/HT (60 nm)/BH1: 3 wt % of Compound A2 (30 nm)/50 wt % of ET: 50 wt % of Liq (25 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (150 nm).
After above layers were deposited, the element was transferred from the deposition chamber to a drying oven and then encapsulated with an UV-curable epoxy resin and a glass cover-plate containing a moisture absorbent. The organic electroluminescent element has a light emitting area of 9 mm2.
The electroluminescent properties of the organic electroluminescent element thus manufactured was determined at room temperature using a constant current source (KEITHLEY 2400 Source Meter, made by Keithley Instruments, Inc., Cleveland, Ohio) and a photometer (PHOTO RESEARCH SpectraScan PR 650, made by Photo Research, Inc., Chatsworth, Calif.).
The measurements were performed by driving the constant current according to light color at room temperature and different initial luminance. The light color was represented by coordinates set forth by the International Commission on Illumination.
