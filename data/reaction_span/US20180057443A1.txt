DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Methods for mechanochemically synthesizing compositions comprising bridged bicyclic-based compounds such as iptycene-based compounds are generally provided. In some cases, two or more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may be mechanochemically reacted such that the product comprises the bridged bicyclic-based compound. In some embodiments, the product (e.g., the bridged bicyclic compound) may comprise two or more [2.2.2] bicyclic cores. In certain embodiments, the mechanochemical reactions described herein may produce higher order bridged bicyclic-based compounds such as poly-iptycenes (e.g., an extended iptycene). In certain embodiments, the bridged bicyclic based compound comprises a molecular cage. The compounds and methods described herein may be useful in various applications including, for example, chemical sensing, absorption of toxic compounds (e.g., toluene, benzene), and/or filtration.
Advantageously, the methods described herein may be iterative such that compositions may be grown in sequence. In some embodiments, the product of the mechanochemical reactions described herein may be isolated and/or purified with a simple washing and/or precipitation step (e.g., without the need for a separate chromatographic separation step).
In some embodiments, the method comprises mechanochemically reacting two or more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compositions to form a product. In certain embodiments, the mechanochemical reaction comprises a bridged bicyclic-based compound (e.g., a bridged bicyclic-based compound comprising two or more [2.2.2] bicyclic cores). Mechanochemically reacting two or more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compositions comprises, in some embodiments, chemically reacting (e.g., via Diels-Alder reaction) a first polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composition and a second polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon composition in the presence of a mechanical force. In some embodiments, the mechanical force may be generated by, for example, mechanical milling (e.g., ball milling).
Advantageously, the use of mechanical milling in combination with the chemical reaction may reduce the reaction time, lower the reaction temperature, increase product yield, and/or reduce and/or eliminate the need for reactive catalysts as compared to the use of chemical reactions alone. In some embodiments, the methods described herein form relatively high number average molecular weight (e.g., greater than 1000 Da) compounds such as high order polyiptycenes (i.e. extended iptycenes).
In some embodiments, the method comprises mechanochemically reacting two or more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compositions in the presence of an additive to form the bridged bicyclic-based compound.

In some embodiments, at least one of the two or more [2.2.2] bicyclic cores is an iptycene core. For example, some embodiments provide compositions including an iptycene-based compound comprising two or more iptycene cores. In certain embodiments, the composition comprises and one or more optionally substituted heterocyclyl or optionally substituted heteroaryl moieties rigidly bonded to at least one iptycene-based core. In some cases, a group may be rigidly bonded to a core such that the group does not easily rotate about a bond axis, e.g., a bond that binds the group to the core. In one embodiment, the group rotates no more than about 180°, no more than about 120°, no more than about 60°, no more than about 30°, or less, about a bond that binds the group to the core. In some cases, a group may be rigidly bound to the core via two covalent bonds. For example, a group may be fused to the core via covalent bonds to two adjacent atoms of the core.
In some cases, the heterocyclyl or heteroaryl moiety may be rigidly bonded to at least one iptycene core and/or may define at least a portion of at least one iptycene core. For example, one or more iptycene cores may include one or more phenyl rings that may be extended or functionalized so as to form a heterocyclyl or heteroaryl moiety (e.g., a carbazole group) which includes one or more phenyl rings of each iptycene core.
In some embodiments, the iptycene-based compound includes a triptycene core. In some embodiments, the iptycene-based compound includes a pentiptycene core. It should be understood that the compound may include other, extended iptycene cores which have, for example, additional numbers of branches, arene planes, and/or extended bridgehead structures. For example, the central phenyl ring of a pentiptycene core may have an extended structure such as a central anthracene ring system. The synthesis of iptycenes and like molecules is described in, for example, Hart, “Iptycenes, Cuppendophanes and Cappedophanes,” Pure and Applied Chemistry, 65(1):27-34 (1993); and Shahlia et al., “Synthesis of Supertriptycene and Two Related Iptycenes,” Journal of Organic Chemistry, 56:6905-6912 (1991), the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, the iptycene core may be synthesized via a Diels-Alder reaction between an anthracene species and a benzyne species.
In some embodiments, the bridged bicyclic-based compound has a structure as in:
<img> id-US20180057443A1-20180301-C00005.TIF </img>
wherein each R can be the same or different and are hydrogen, halo, hydroxyl, amino, alkyl (e.g., CmH2m+1 where m is an integer and is at least 1), heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, or a carbonyl group, any of which is optionally substituted, or can be joined together to form an optionally substituted ring.

In some such embodiments, the bridged bicyclic-based compound is an oligoiptycene (e.g., a poly-iptycene having between 2-10 bicyclic cores).
In some embodiments, m is an integer and is at least 1. For example, in some embodiments, m is an integer in the range of from 1 to 20 (e.g., from 1 to 10, from 2 to 12, from 5 to 15, or from 10 to 20). Other ranges are also possible.
In some embodiments, the bridged bicyclic compound is a higher order polyiptcyene (e.g., an extended iptycene). In some such embodiments, the polyiptcyene may have a structure as in:
<img> id-US20180057443A1-20180301-C00006.TIF </img>
wherein each R can be the same or different and are hydrogen, halo, hydroxyl, amino, alkyl (e.g., CmH2m+1 where m is an integer and is at least 1), heteroalkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, or a carbonyl group, any of which is optionally substituted, or can be joined together to form an optionally substituted ring, and n is an integer and is at least 1.

The fixed distance may be determined by measuring the distance between the atom of the first group closest to the atom of the second group, at their closest proximity taking into account variation in proximity that may occur with any movement/orientation of the first and second groups relative to each other (e.g. rotation, vibration, and other movement normal and expected at room temperature). The distance between two atoms means as would be measured by those of ordinary skill in the art, generally involving the space taken by an atom being the extent of its electron cloud, as measured, for example, by the scattering of X-rays, or by measuring the density of a liquid.

EXAMPLES
The following examples are intended to illustrate certain embodiments of the present invention, but do not exemplify the full scope of the invention.
An iterative reaction sequence was used to prepare extended iptycenes, wherein a Diels-Alder reactions and a subsequent aromatization afforded higher order iptycenes. Mechanochemical activation was used and suitable additives that efficiently promoted the reactions in solid state were identified. An efficient double Diels-Alder reaction allowed rapid access to functionalized iptycenes with molecular weights over 2000 Daltons.
Similar to the original synthesis of triptycene, a Diels-Alder reaction was used to create the [2.2.2] bicyclic ring system. To achieve large, soluble and structurally well-defined iptycenes, a strategy for incorporation of functional groups with aromatization after each Diels-Alder reaction was employed. Iterative cycling of this process provided rapid access to functionalized extended iptycenes. These functional groups could be used to modify the resultant properties such as, for example, solubility. 1,4-Anthraquinone was used as a building block for this scheme, and its reaction with anthracene produced an enolizable 1,4-diketone that regenerated an anthracene derivative for the subsequent Diel-Alder reactions (FIG. 1B).
Thermally activated Diels-Alder reactions often require long reaction time, which makes a long synthetic route generally impractical. Additionally at higher temperature retro-Diels-Alder reactions can be expected, which can also limit yields. Although strong Lewis acids, such as aluminum chloride (AlCl3) may promote Diels-Alder reactions, these catalysts are generally not amenable when the structures contain sensitive functional groups. Secondly, anthracene-1,4-diol (2) produced by the enolization of 1 undergoes rapid air oxidation to form anthracene-1,4-dione (3) (FIG. 2, a). As a result, a synthesis with a coupled functionalization-aromatization step as illustrated in FIG. 1 was used. Alternative routes, avoiding this oxidation issue include silicon protection and then a deprotective sulfonylation sequence, which suffers from a limited yield (FIG. 2, b).
Various Lewis acids were screened with the aim to lower the LOMO energy of anthraquinone via coordination of the carbonyl groups with Lewis acid. It was quickly found that anhydrous ZnCl2 was a suitable additive for the Diels-Alder reaction. A 5:1:1 ratio of ZnCl2:anthracene:1,4-anthraquinone, gave full conversion of the reaction under vibration frequency of 30 Hz at room temperature in 4.5 h. Notably, column chromatography was not required to purify the product. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and washed with 3N HCl to remove ZnCl2. After concentration, the pure product was isolated in 85% yield by precipitation from methanol (FIG. 3, a).
The conditions for the aromatization/functionalization step under ball-milling conditions using lauric anhydride as an acylating reagent and potassium carbonate as the base was then developed. It is noteworthy that the use of acid chlorides afforded generally lower yields as a result of reactions with the base. However, under these conditions oxidation is generally problematic and anthraquinone 3 (FIG. 2) was a major byproduct. The use of the N,N-dimethylpyridine (DMAP) as a base and zinc metal as an additive significantly increased the product yield. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the residue oxygen in the ball-milling vial could be consumed by the formation of zinc oxide. Furthermore, the electron rich metal surface may reduce 3, if formed, back to 2 for in-situ acylation. With the addition of zinc powder, the undesired oxidative pathway was suppressed. The crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane and filtered through a short pad of silica gel. After concentration, the pure product 4a was isolated in 92% yield by precipitation from methanol (FIG. 3, a). Benzoic anhydride, triphenylsilyl chloride, and tosyl chloride were also suitable electrophiles under the current condition, thereby giving access to a series of anthracene derivatives appended with various functional groups 4b-4d (FIG. 4).
To achieve extended iptycenes by using the iterative reaction sequence (FIG. 1), the Diels-Alder reaction between 4a-d and 1,4-anthraquinone was attempted. It was found that anthracene derivative 4a with an alkyl side chain gave a low yield of Diels-Alder product in presence of ZnCl2, and no Diels-Alder product was observed with 4b, 4c, and 4d, which may be as a result of steric hindrance introduced by the bulky substituents. Steric effects can generally reduce diffusion rates, which can present significant difficulties in solid state reactions. It is also possible that competitive interaction of the ZnCl2 with the ester can reduce the activation of 1,4-anthraquinone. To increase the mobility of the reactant in solid state and also enhance the activation of the dienophile, a Brønsted acid additive was employed. It is noteworthy that the symbiotic combination of Lewis acid and Brønsted acid may provide a higher acidity than that of each induvial component to create unique catalytic properties.
After a series of screening experiments, the addition of perfluorononanoic acid (C8F17COOH) allowed the desired transformation to proceed with high efficiency (FIG. 5, a). Repeating the designed iterative reaction sequence successfully produced the extended iptycene in good yield (FIG. 5, b). Without wishing to be bound by theory, as a result of the incorporated alkyl groups, the iptycenes synthesized through this method were highly soluble in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and tetrahydrofuran.
In order to accelerate the process to prepare larger iptycenes, the feasibility of a double Diels-Alder reaction by using triptycene diquinone as a bifunctionalized dienenophile was explored. By increasing the amount of ZnCl2 and the additive C8F17COOH, the desired double Diels-Alder product was obtained in satisfactory yield (FIG. 6), demonstrating the high efficiency of mechanochemical reaction. Interestingly, although multiple stereoisomers can be generated, only one isomer was obtained in this reaction (FIG. 6). With the double Diels-Alder product 10 in hand, an iptycene-based molecular cage (defined by the cavity highlighted in blue in (FIG. 7) appended by various groups can be easily constructed through a four-fold esterification (FIG. 7).
The absorption properties of 10-13 for selected molecules were tested by using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and the results are summarized in FIG. 8. These molecules displayed good uptake upon exposure low concentrations (500 ppm) of organic vapors. Despite the fact that hydrogen boding and dipole interactions are strengthened in solid state structures, 10, 12, and 13 showed clear selectivity for the absorption of aromatic molecules over ethanol and acetonitrile. This latter effect may also be considered to be in part a result of the hydrophobic nature of these materials. Interestingly, the gas absorption selectivity could be tuned by incorporation of different side groups. For instance, 11 with a high arene composition showed a better uptake of all four kinds of gas vapor as compared to 10, whereas 12 containing adamantyl groups displayed significantly enhanced selectivity toward benzene and toluene. Such materials may be useful as filters or preconcentrators to selectively remove or detect organic vapors.
Synthesis of Porous Materials for Absorption of Organic Molecules
Polymeric materials often have large surface area because the connections between monomers decrease the amount of adaptable conformations such that the polymers align in a random way, thereby introducing void in solid state. In this regard, polyiptycene may be a useful candidate as gas absorption materials. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the noncompliant three-dimensional rigid structure may not only provide a relatively high surface area, but also increases the solubility of the polymer by preventing the self-aggregation. Furthermore, polyiptycene has a high arene composition and is generally capable of creating molecular cavitand by its concave backbone.
To achieve an efficient preparation of polyiptycene, a Diels-Alder polymerization under solvent-free condition was developed. The monomers were synthesized and may be modified with various functional groups through alkylation or esterification (FIG. 9).
Monomers with longer alkyl group were generally less crystalline and tended to have a low melting point, which may be important to obtain a high molecular weight (MW) polymer before solidification occurs under solvent-free condition. It is noteworthy that the polymerization was less efficient in solution and only oligomer was obtained when the reaction was carried out in 1,2-dichlorobenzene or diphenyl ether. The molecular weight of the polymer was partially controlled by reaction time, with longer reaction affording larger polymers. The polymerization of monomer 1 produced polymer (Polymer A) with MW between 7800 and 12200 Da. In contrast, polymer (Polymer B) with MW higher than 20000 Da was obtained by using monomer 2, which may be due to the electron-withdrawing property of the carbonyl group (FIG. 10). FIG. 11 shows the absorption abilities of iptycene-based materials.
FIG. 12 shows the comparison of the 1H NMR of the monomer (FIG. 10, 1) and ladder-type polymer (FIG. 10, Polymer A). FIG. 13 shows the comparison of the 13C NMR of the monomer (FIG. 10, 1) and ladder-type polymer (FIG. 10, Polymer A). FIG. 14 shows the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) trace of the ladder polymer.

Procedure for Mechanochemical Promoted Double Diels-Alder Reaction Between 4a and 9.
To a ZrO2 vial (35 mL volume) was added 9 (0.040 g, 0.126 mmol), 4a (237 mg, 2.5 equiv, 0.316 mmol), ZnCl2 (0.172 mg, 1.26 mmol, 10 equiv) and perfluorononanoic acid (235 mg, 0.505 mmol, 4.0 equiv) followed by one ZrO2 milling ball (10 mm diameter). The tightly sealed vial was subjected to milling for 4.5 h with a frequency of 30 Hz. After washing out the milling vial using CH2Cl2 (20 mL), the resulting CH2Cl2 solution was filtered through a short pad of silica gel and washed with CH2Cl2. The solvent was evaporated to gave the crude product, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography by using a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as the eluent to give 10 as an off-white solid, which was washed with cold methanol to give pure product (177 mg, 0.097 mmol, yield: 77%).

FIG. 15 shows representative QCM measurement result of the gas absorption property of absorptive materials.
While several embodiments of the present invention have been described and illustrated herein, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily envision a variety of other means and/or structures for performing the functions and/or obtaining the results and/or one or more of the advantages described herein, and each of such variations and/or modifications is deemed to be within the scope of the present invention. More generally, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that all parameters, dimensions, materials, and configurations described herein are meant to be exemplary and that the actual parameters, dimensions, materials, and/or configurations will depend upon the specific application or applications for which the teachings of the present invention is/are used. Those skilled in the art will recognize, or be able to ascertain using no more than routine experimentation, many equivalents to the specific embodiments of the invention described herein. It is, therefore, to be understood that the foregoing embodiments are presented by way of example only and that, within the scope of the appended claims and equivalents thereto, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described and claimed. The present invention is directed to each individual feature, system, article, material, kit, and/or method described herein. In addition, any combination of two or more such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods, if such features, systems, articles, materials, kits, and/or methods are not mutually inconsistent, is included within the scope of the present invention.
The indefinite articles “a” and “an,” as used herein in the specification and in the claims, unless clearly indicated to the contrary, should be understood to mean “at least one.”
The phrase “and/or,” as used herein in the specification and in the claims, should be understood to mean “either or both” of the elements so conjoined, i.e., elements that are conjunctively present in some cases and disjunctively present in other cases. Other elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified by the “and/or” clause, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified unless clearly indicated to the contrary. Thus, as a non-limiting example, a reference to “A and/or B,” when used in conjunction with open-ended language such as “comprising” can refer, in one embodiment, to A without B (optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to B without A (optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to both A and B (optionally including other elements); etc.
As used herein in the specification and in the claims, “or” should be understood to have the same meaning as “and/or” as defined above. For example, when separating items in a list, “or” or “and/or” shall be interpreted as being inclusive, i.e., the inclusion of at least one, but also including more than one, of a number or list of elements, and, optionally, additional unlisted items. Only terms clearly indicated to the contrary, such as “only one of” or “exactly one of,” or, when used in the claims, “consisting of,” will refer to the inclusion of exactly one element of a number or list of elements. In general, the term “or” as used herein shall only be interpreted as indicating exclusive alternatives (i.e. “one or the other but not both”) when preceded by terms of exclusivity, such as “either,” “one of,” “only one of,” or “exactly one of.” “Consisting essentially of,” when used in the claims, shall have its ordinary meaning as used in the field of patent law.
As used herein in the specification and in the claims, the phrase “at least one,” in reference to a list of one or more elements, should be understood to mean at least one element selected from any one or more of the elements in the list of elements, but not necessarily including at least one of each and every element specifically listed within the list of elements and not excluding any combinations of elements in the list of elements. This definition also allows that elements may optionally be present other than the elements specifically identified within the list of elements to which the phrase “at least one” refers, whether related or unrelated to those elements specifically identified. Thus, as a non-limiting example, “at least one of A and B” (or, equivalently, “at least one of A or B,” or, equivalently “at least one of A and/or B”) can refer, in one embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, with no B present (and optionally including elements other than B); in another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, B, with no A present (and optionally including elements other than A); in yet another embodiment, to at least one, optionally including more than one, A, and at least one, optionally including more than one, B (and optionally including other elements); etc.
In the claims, as well as in the specification above, all transitional phrases such as “comprising,” “including,” “carrying,” “having,” “containing,” “involving,” “holding,” and the like are to be understood to be open-ended, i.e., to mean including but not limited to. Only the transitional phrases “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of” shall be closed or semi-closed transitional phrases, respectively, as set forth in the United States Patent Office Manual of Patent Examining Procedures, Section 2111.03.
Any terms as used herein related to shape and/or geometric relationship of or between, for example, one or more articles, structures, and/or subcomponents thereof and/or combinations thereof and/or any other tangible or intangible elements not listed above amenable to characterization by such terms, unless otherwise defined or indicated, shall be understood to not require absolute conformance to a mathematical definition of such term, but, rather, shall be understood to indicate conformance to the mathematical definition of such term to the extent possible for the subject matter so characterized as would be understood by one skilled in the art most closely related to such subject matter. Examples of such terms related to shape and/or geometric relationship include, but are not limited to terms descriptive of: shape-such as, round, square, circular/circle, rectangular/rectangle, triangular/triangle, cylindrical/cylinder, elliptical/ellipse, (n)polygonal/(n)polygon, etc.; surface and/or bulk material properties and/or spatial/temporal resolution and/or distribution-such as, smooth, reflective, transparent, clear, opaque, rigid, impermeable, uniform(ly), inert, non-wettable, insoluble, steady, invariant, constant, homogeneous, etc.; as well as many others that would be apparent to those skilled in the relevant arts. As one example, a fabricated article that would described herein as being “square” would not require such article to have faces or sides that are perfectly planar or linear and that intersect at angles of exactly 90 degrees (indeed, such an article can only exist as a mathematical abstraction), but rather, the shape of such article should be interpreted as approximating a “square,” as defined mathematically, to an extent typically achievable and achieved for the recited fabrication technique as would be understood by those skilled in the art or as specifically described.
