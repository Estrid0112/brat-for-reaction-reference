BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention
The present disclosure relates to a novel organic compound and an organic light-emitting diode including the same. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a novel organic compound that can guarantee the device properties of high efficiency, long lifespan, and low-voltage driving when used in an organic light-emitting diode, and an organic light-emitting diode including the same.
2. Description of the Prior Art
Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), based on self-luminescence, enjoy the advantage of having a wide viewing angle and being able to be made thinner and lighter than liquid crystal displays (LCDs). In addition, an OLED display exhibits a very fast response time. Accordingly, OLEDs find applications in the illumination field as well as the full-color display field.
In general, the term “organic light-emitting phenomenon” refers to a phenomenon in which electrical energy is converted to light energy by means of an organic material. An OLED using the organic light-emitting phenomenon has a structure usually comprising an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer interposed therebetween.
In this regard, the organic material layer may be, for the most part, of a multilayer structure consisting of different materials, for example, a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. In the organic light-emitting diode having such a structure, when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes, a hole injected from the anode migrates to the organic layer while an electron is released from the cathode and moves toward the organic layer. In the luminescent zone, the hole and the electron recombine to produce an exciton. When the exciton returns to the ground state from the excited state, the molecule of the organic layer emits light. Such an organic light-emitting diode is known to have characteristics such as self-luminescence, high luminance, high efficiency, low driving voltage, a wide viewing angle, high contrast, and high-speed response.
Materials used as organic layers in OLEDs may be divided into luminescent materials and charge transport materials, for example, a hole injection material, a hole transport material, an electron injection material, and an electron transport material and, as needed, further into an electron-blocking material or a hole-blocking material.
With regard to related arts pertaining to hole transport layers, reference may be made to Korean Patent No. 10-1074193 (issued Oct. 14, 2011), which describes an organic light-emitting diode using a carbazole structure fused with at least one benzene ring in a hole transport layer, and Korean Patent No. 10-1455156 (issued Oct. 27, 2014), which describes an organic light-emitting diode in which the HOMO energy level of an auxiliary light-emitting layer is set between those of a hole transport layer and a light-emitting layer.
In spite of enormous effort for fabricating organic light-emitting diodes having more effective luminous properties, there is still continued need to develop novel organic light-emitting materials suitable for use in hole injection layers and hole transport layers of organic light-emitting diodes that can operate at lower voltage with higher light emission efficiency and longer lifespan, compared to those developed based on conventional technology.

wherein O is oxygen, and A is selected from among a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl of 1 to 30 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl of 5 to 50 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkenyl of 2 to 30 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted alkynyl of 2 to 20 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl of 3 to 30 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkenyl of 5 to 30 carbon atoms, and a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl of 2 to 50 carbon atoms bearing O, N, or S as a heteroatom.
An electron injection layer (EIL) that functions to facilitate electron injection from the cathode, thus improving the power efficiency of the diode, may be further deposited on the electron transport layer. So long as it is conventionally used in the art, any material can be available for the electron injection layer without particular limitations. Examples include LiF, NaCl, CsF, Li2O, and BaO.
Deposition conditions for the electron injection layer may vary, depending on compounds used, but may be generally selected from condition scopes that are almost the same as for the formation of hole injection layers.
The electron injection layer may range in thickness from about 1 Å to about 100 Å, and particularly from about 3 Å to about 90 Å. Given the thickness range for the electron injection layer, the diode can exhibit satisfactory electron injection properties without actually elevating a driving voltage.
Here, the cathode may be made of lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al-Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg-In), or magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag). For a top-emitting OLED, a transparent cathode made of ITO or IZO may be employed.
Further, one or more layers selected from among a hole injecting layer, a hole transport layer, a functional layer capable of both hole injection and hole transport, a light-emitting layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer may be deposited using a deposition process or a solution process.
Here, the deposition process is a process by which a material is vaporized and deposited in a vacuum or at a low pressure to form a layer, and the solution process is a method in which a material is dissolved in a solvent and applied for the formation of a thin film by means of inkjet printing, roll-to-roll coating, screen printing, spray coating, dip coating, spin coating, etc.
Also, the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure may be applied to a device selected from among flat display devices, flexible display devices, monochrome or grayscale flat illumination devices, and monochrome or grayscale flexible illumination devices.
Below, the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure is explained with reference to FIG. 1.
FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of the structure of an organic light-emitting diode according to some embodiments of the present disclosure. The organic light-emitting diode includes an anode 20, a hole transport layer 40, an organic light-emitting layer 50, an electron transport layer 60, and a cathode 80, and optionally a hole injection layer 30 or an electron injection layer 70. In addition, one or two intermediate layers may be further formed in the organic light-emitting diode. A hole barrier layer or an electron barrier layer may be also further established.
Reference is made to FIG. 1 with regard to the organic light-emitting diode of the present disclosure and the fabrication thereof. First, a substrate 10 is coated with an anode electrode material to form an anode 20. So long as it is used in a typical organic EL device, any substrate may be used as the substrate 10. Preferable is an organic substrate or transparent plastic substrate that exhibits excellent transparency, surface smoothness, ease of handling, and waterproofness. As the anode electrode material, indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), tin oxide (SnO2), or zinc oxide (ZnO), which are transparent and superior in terms of conductivity, may be used.
A hole injection layer material is applied on the anode electrode 20 by thermal deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating to form a hole injection layer 30. Subsequently, using thermal deposition in a vacuum or spin coating, a hole transport layer material is applied to the hole injection layer 30 to form a hole transport layer 40.
Then, an organic light-emitting layer 50 is deposited on the hole transport layer 40, optionally followed by the formation of a hole barrier layer (not shown) on the organic light-emitting layer 50 by deposition in a vacuum or by spin coating. When holes traverse the organic light-emitting layer and are introduced into the cathode, the efficiency and lifespan of the diode are deteriorated. Formed of a material with a low HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) level, the hole barrier layer serves to prevent the introduction of holes into the cathode. Any material that has a higher ionization potential than the light-emitting compound and which is also able to carry electrons may be used for the hole barrier layer without limitation. Representative among hole barrier materials are BAlq, BCP, and TPBI.
Using a vacuum deposition method or a spin-coating method, an electron transport layer 60 may be deposited on the hole barrier layer and may then be overlaid with an electron injection layer 70. A cathode metal is deposited on the electron injection layer 70 by thermal deposition in a vacuum to form a cathode 80, thus obtaining an organic EL diode. Here, the cathode may be made of lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), aluminum-lithium (Al-Li), calcium (Ca), magnesium-indium (Mg-In), or magnesium-silver (Mg-Ag). For a top-emitting OLED, a transparent cathode made of ITO or IZO may be employed.

Examples 1 to 17: Fabrication of Organic Light-Emitting Diode
An ITO glass substrate was patterned to have a translucent area of 2 mm×2 mm and cleansed. The ITO glass was mounted in a vacuum chamber that was then set to have a base pressure of 1×10−6 torr. On the ITO glass substrate, HATCN (50 Å) was deposited, followed by one of the compounds prepared according to the present disclosure, as listed in Table 1, below, for a hole transport layer (650 Å). Then, a light-emitting layer 200 Å thick was formed by doping with 5% of a blue host (BH)+blue dopant (BD). Subsequently, deposition was made with compound ET:Liq=1:1 (300 Å) for an electron transport layer, Liq (10 Å) for an electron injection layer, and Al (1,000 Å). The light-emitting diodes thus obtained were measured at 0.4 mA for luminescence properties. Structures of [HATCN], [BH], [BD], [ET], and [Liq] are as follows:
Comparative Example 1

The ITO glass substrate was mounted in a vacuum chamber that was then set to have a base pressure of 1×10−6 torr. On the ITO glass substrate, HATCN (50 Å) was deposited, followed by NPD (900 Å). Then, a light-emitting layer 300 Å thick was formed by doping the host material CBP and a green phosphorescent dopant (GD, 7%). Subsequently, deposition was made with compound ET:Liq=1:1 (300 Å), Liq (10 Å), and Al (1,000 Å) in that order.

The ITO glass substrate was mounted in a vacuum chamber that was then set to have a base pressure of 1×10−6 torr. On the ITO glass substrate, HATCN (50 Å) was deposited, followed by NPD (550 Å). Then, a hole auxiliary layer was formed on the hole transport layer by depositing the Comparative Compound 1 (350 Å), and a light-emitting layer 300 Å thick was formed by doping the host material CBP and a green phosphorescent dopant (GD, 7%). Subsequently, deposition was made with compound ET:Liq=1:1 (300 Å), Liq (10 Å), and Al (1,000 Å) in that order.
