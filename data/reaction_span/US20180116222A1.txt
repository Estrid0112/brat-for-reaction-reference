The present invention relates to novel fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives of the formula (I), to their use as acaricides and/or insecticides for controlling animal pests, particularly arthropods and especially insects and arachnids, and to processes and intermediates for their preparation.
Fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives having insecticidal properties have already been described in the literature, for example in WO 2010/125985, WO 2012/074135, WO 2012/086848, WO 2013/018928, WO 2013/191113, WO 2014/142292, WO 2014/148451, WO 2015/000715, EP 15191440.5, EP 15197267.6 and EP 16152384.0.
However, the active compounds already known according to the documents cited above have some disadvantages on application, whether because they exhibit only a narrow range of application or because they do not have satisfactory insecticidal or acaricidal activity.
Novel fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives have now been found, and these have advantages over the compounds already known, examples of which are better biological or environmental properties, a wider range of application methods, better insecticidal or acaricidal activity, and also good compatibility with crop plants. The fused bicyclic heterocycle derivatives can be used in combination with further agents for improving efficacy, especially against insects that are difficult to control.
The present invention therefore provides novel compounds of the formula (I)

Methods and Uses
The invention also relates to methods for controlling animal pests, in which compounds of the formula (I) are allowed to act on animal pests and/or their habitat. The control of the animal pests is preferably carried out in agriculture and forestry, and in material protection. Preferably excluded from this are methods for the surgical or therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and diagnostic methods carried out on the human or animal body.
The invention further relates to the use of the compounds of the formula (I) as pesticides, especially crop protection agents.
In the context of the present application, the term “pesticide” also always comprises the term “crop protection agent”.
The compounds of the formula (I), given good plant tolerance, favourable homeotherm toxicity and good environmental compatibility, are suitable for protecting plants and plant organs against biotic and abiotic stress factors, for increasing harvest yields, for improving the quality of the harvested material and for controlling animal pests, especially insects, arachnids, helminths, nematodes and molluscs, which are encountered in agriculture, in horticulture, in animal husbandry, in aquatic cultures, in forests, in gardens and leisure facilities, in the protection of stored products and of materials, and in the hygiene sector.
In the context of the present patent application, the term “hygiene” is understood as meaning the entirety of all measures, processes and procedures whose aim it is to prevent disorders-in particular infective diseases-and to serve to keep humans, animals and/or the environment healthy and/or to maintain cleanliness. According to the invention, this includes in particular measures for cleaning, disinfecting and sterilizing, for example, textiles or solid surfaces, mainly of glass, wood, concrete, porcelain, ceramic, plastic or else of metal(s), and keeping them clean of hygiene pests and/or their faeces. Excluded according to the invention are in this respect again processes for the surgical or therapeutic treatment of the human or animal body and diagnostic processes undertaken on the human or animal body.
The term “hygiene sector” thus includes all areas, technical fields and commercial utilizations in which such hygiene measures, processes and procedures are of importance, for example hygiene in kitchens, bakeries, airports, baths, swimming pools, shopping centres, hotels, hospitals, stables, etc.
Accordingly, the term “hygiene pest” is understood as meaning one or more animal pests whose presence in the hygiene sector is problematic, in particular for health reasons. Accordingly, the main aim is to minimize or prevent hygiene pests or contact therewith in the hygiene sector. This can be effected, in particular, by using a pesticide, where the agent can be employed both prophylactically and only in the case of infestation to control the pest. It is also possible to use agents which act by avoiding or reducing contact with the pest. Hygiene pests are, for example, the organisms mentioned below.
Thus, the term “hygiene protection” includes all actions which serve to maintain and/or improve such hygiene measures, processes and procedures.
The compounds of the formula (I) can preferably be used as pesticides. They are active against normally sensitive and resistant species and also against all or some stages of development. The abovementioned pests include:

The compounds of the formula (I) can optionally, at certain concentrations or application rates, also be used as herbicides, safeners, growth regulators or agents to improve plant properties, as microbicides or gametocides, for example as fungicides, antimycotics, bactericides, virucides (including agents against viroids) or as agents against MLO (mycoplasma-like organisms) and RLO (rickettsia-like organisms). If appropriate, they can also be used as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of other active compounds.
Formulations
The present invention further relates to formulations and use forms prepared therefrom as pesticides, for example drench, drip and spray liquors, comprising at least one compound of the formula (I). Optionally, the use forms comprise further pesticides and/or adjuvants which improve action, such as penetrants, e.g. vegetable oils, for example rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, mineral oils, for example paraffin oils, alkyl esters of vegetable fatty acids, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, or alkanol alkoxylates and/or spreaders, for example alkylsiloxanes and/or salts, for example organic or inorganic ammonium or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate and/or retention promoters, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate or hydroxypropylguar polymers and/or humectants, for example glycerol and/or fertilizers, for example ammonium-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilizers.
Customary formulations are, for example, water-soluble liquids (SL), emulsion concentrates (EC), emulsions in water (EW), suspension concentrates (SC, SE, FS, OD), water-dispersible granules (WG), granules (GR) and capsule concentrates (CS); these and further possible formulation types are described, for example, by Crop Life International and in Pesticide Specifications, Manual on development and use of FAO and WHO specifications for pesticides, FAO Plant Production and Protection Papers-173, prepared by the FAO/WHO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Specifications, 2004, ISBN: 9251048576. The formulations, in addition to one or more compounds of the formula (I), optionally comprise further agrochemically active compounds.
Preference is given to formulations or use forms comprising auxiliaries, for example extenders, solvents, spontaneity promoters, carriers, emulsifiers, dispersants, frost protection agents, biocides, thickeners and/or further auxiliaries, for example adjuvants. An adjuvant in this context is a component which enhances the biological effect of the formulation, without the component itself having any biological effect. Examples of adjuvants are agents which promote retention, spreading, attachment to the leaf surface or penetration.
These formulations are prepared in a known way, for example by mixing the compounds of the formula (I) with auxiliaries such as, for example, extenders, solvents and/or solid carriers and/or other auxiliaries such as, for example, surfactants. The formulations are produced either in suitable facilities or else before or during application.
The auxiliaries used may be substances suitable for imparting special properties, such as certain physical, technical and/or biological properties, to the formulation of the compounds of the formula (I), or to the use forms prepared from these formulations (for example ready-to-use pesticides such as spray liquors or seed dressing products).
Suitable extenders are, for example, water, polar and nonpolar organic chemical liquids, for example from the classes of the aromatic and non-aromatic hydrocarbons (such as paraffins, alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, chlorobenzenes), the alcohols and polyols (which, if appropriate, may also be substituted, etherified and/or esterified), the ketones (such as acetone, cyclohexanone), esters (including fats and oils) and (poly)ethers, the simple and substituted amines, amides, lactams (such as N-alkylpyrrolidones) and lactones, the sulphones and sulphoxides (such as dimethyl sulphoxide).
If the extender utilized is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols such as butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.
In principle, it is possible to use all suitable solvents. Examples of suitable solvents are aromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzene, chloroethylene or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane, paraffins, mineral oil fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol or glycol and their ethers and esters, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.
In principle, it is possible to use all suitable carriers. Useful carriers especially include: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic materials such as finely divided silica, alumina and natural or synthetic silicates, resins, waxes and/or solid fertilizers. It is likewise possible to use mixtures of such carriers. Useful carriers for granules include: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite, and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic flours, and also granules of organic material such as sawdust, paper, coconut shells, corn cobs and tobacco stalks.
It is also possible to use liquefied gaseous extenders or solvents. Especially suitable are those extenders or carriers which are gaseous at standard temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellants such as halogenated hydrocarbons, and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Examples of emulsifiers and/or foam formers, dispersants or wetting agents having ionic or nonionic properties or mixtures of these surface-active substances are salts of polyacrylic acid, salts of lignosulphonic acid, salts of phenolsulphonic acid or naphthalenesulphonic acid, polycondensates of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols or with fatty acids or with fatty amines, with substituted phenols (preferably alkylphenols or arylphenols), salts of sulphosuccinic esters, taurine derivatives (preferably alkyl taurates), phosphoric esters of polyethoxylated alcohols or phenols, fatty acid esters of polyols, and derivatives of the compounds containing sulphates, sulphonates and phosphates, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates, protein hydrolysates, lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose. The presence of a surfactant is advantageous if one of the compounds of the formula (I) and/or one of the inert carriers is insoluble in water and when the application takes place in water.
Further auxiliaries which may be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom are dyes such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyes such as alizarin dyes, azo dyes and metal phthalocyanine dyes, and nutrients and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.
Additional components which may be present are stabilizers, such as cold stabilizers, preservatives, antioxidants, light stabilizers, or other agents which improve chemical and/or physical stability. Foam generators or antifoams may also be present.
In addition, the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom may also comprise, as additional auxiliaries, stickers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, or else natural phospholipids such as cephalins and lecithins and synthetic phospholipids. Further auxiliaries may be mineral and vegetable oils.
It is possible if appropriate for still further auxiliaries to be present in the formulations and the use forms derived therefrom. Examples of such additives are fragrances, protective colloids, binders, adhesives, thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrants, retention promoters, stabilizers, sequestrants, complexing agents, humectants, spreaders. In general, the compounds of the formula (I) can be combined with any solid or liquid additive commonly used for formulation purposes.
Useful retention promoters include all those substances which reduce dynamic surface tension, for example dioctyl sulphosuccinate, or increase viscoelasticity, for example hydroxypropylguar polymers.
Suitable penetrants in the present context are all those substances which are usually used for improving the penetration of agrochemical active compounds into plants. Penetrants are defined in this context by their ability to penetrate from the (generally aqueous) application liquor and/or from the spray coating into the cuticle of the plant and hence increase the mobility of the active compounds in the cuticle. The method described in the literature (Baur et al., 1997, Pesticide Science 51, 131-152) can be used for determining this property. Examples include alcohol alkoxylates such as coconut fatty ethoxylate (10) or isotridecyl ethoxylate (12), fatty acid esters, for example rapeseed oil methyl ester or soya oil methyl ester, fatty amine alkoxylates, for example tallowamine ethoxylate (15), or ammonium and/or phosphonium salts, for example ammonium sulphate or diammonium hydrogenphosphate.
The formulations preferably comprise between 0.00000001% and 98% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), more preferably between 0.01% and 95% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), most preferably between 0.5% and 90% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), based on the weight of the formulation.
The content of the compound of the formula (I) in the use forms prepared from the formulations (in particular pesticides) may vary within wide ranges. The concentration of the compound of the formula (I) in the use forms may typically be between 0.00000001% and 95% by weight of the compound of the formula (I), preferably between 0.00001% and 1% by weight, based on the weight of the use form. Application is accomplished in a customary manner appropriate for the use forms.
Mixtures
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be used in a mixture with one or more suitable fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, molluscicides, nematicides, insecticides, microbiological agents, beneficial organisms, herbicides, fertilizers, bird repellents, phytotonics, sterilants, safeners, semiochemicals and/or plant growth regulators, in order thus, for example, to broaden the spectrum of action, prolong the period of action, enhance the rate of action, prevent repellency or prevent evolution of resistance. In addition, active compound combinations of this kind can improve plant growth and/or tolerance to abiotic factors, for example high or low temperatures, to drought or to elevated water content or soil salinity. It is also possible to improve flowering and fruiting performance, optimize germination capacity and root development, facilitate harvesting and improve yields, influence maturation, improve the quality and/or the nutritional value of the harvested products, prolong storage life and/or improve the processability of the harvested products.
In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) may be present in a mixture with other active compounds or semiochemicals such as attractants and/or bird repellents and/or plant activators and/or growth regulators and/or fertilizers. Likewise, the compounds of the formula (I) can be used in mixtures with agents to improve plant properties, for example growth, yield and quality of the harvested material.
In a particular embodiment according to the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) are present in formulations or in the use forms prepared from these formulations in a mixture with further compounds, preferably those as described below.
If one of the compounds mentioned below can occur in different tautomeric forms, these forms are also included even if not explicitly mentioned in each case.

Plants and Plant Parts
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are understood here to mean all plants and populations of plants, such as desirable and undesirable wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants), for example cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya bean, potato, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other vegetable species, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape, and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant cultivars which are protectable or non-protectable by plant breeders' rights. Plant parts shall be understood to mean all parts and organs of the plants above and below ground, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples given being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, slips and seeds.
Treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the compounds of the formula (I) is carried out directly or by allowing the compounds to act on their surroundings, environment or storage space by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, evaporation, fogging, scattering, painting on, injection and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, also by applying one or more coats.
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and parts thereof in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering methods, if appropriate in combination with conventional methods (genetically modified organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term “parts” or “parts of plants” or “plant parts” has been explained above. Particular preference is given in accordance with the invention to treating plants of the respective commercially customary plant cultivars or those that are in use. Plant cultivars are understood to mean plants having new properties (“traits”) and which have been grown by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They may be cultivars, varieties, biotypes or genotypes.
Transgenic Plants, Seed Treatment and Integration Events
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated in accordance with the invention include all plants which, through the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparts particular advantageous useful properties (“traits”) to these plants.
Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to levels of water or soil salinity, enhanced flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated ripening, higher harvest yields, higher quality and/or higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage life and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are increased resistance of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as insects, arachnids, nematodes, mites, slugs and snails owing, for example, to toxins formed in the plants, in particular those produced in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CryIA(a), CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryIIA, CryIIIA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CryIF and also combinations thereof), and also increased resistance of the plants against phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses caused, for example, by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosates or phosphinothricin (for example the “PAT” gene). The genes which impart the desired properties (“traits”) in question may also be present in combinations with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of transgenic plants include the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice, triticale, barley, rye, oats), maize, soya beans, potatoes, sugar beet, sugar cane, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetable, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), particular emphasis being given to maize, soya beans, wheat, rice, potatoes, cotton, sugar cane, tobacco and oilseed rape. Properties (“traits”) which are particularly emphasized are the increased resistance of the plants to insects, arachnids, nematodes and slugs and snails.
Crop Protection-Types of Treatment
The plants and plant parts are treated with the compounds of the formula (I) directly or by action on their surroundings, habitat or storage space using customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, atomizing, irrigating, evaporating, dusting, fogging, broadcasting, foaming, painting, spreading-on, injecting, watering (drenching), drip irrigating and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seed, additionally by dry seed treatment, liquid seed treatment, slurry treatment, by incrusting, by coating with one or more coats, etc. It is furthermore possible to apply the compounds of the formula (I) by the ultra-low volume method or to inject the application form or the compound of the formula (I) itself into the soil.
A preferred direct treatment of the plants is foliar application, i.e. compounds of the formula (I) are applied to the foliage, where treatment frequency and the application rate should be adjusted according to the level of infestation with the pest in question.
In the case of systemically active compounds, the compounds of the formula (I) also access the plants via the root system. The plants are then treated by the action of the compounds of the formula (I) on the habitat of the plant. This can be accomplished, for example, by drenching, or by mixing into the soil or the nutrient solution, meaning that the locus of the plant (e.g. soil or hydroponic systems) is impregnated with a liquid form of the compounds of the formula (I), or by soil application, meaning that the compounds of the formula (I) are introduced in solid form (e.g. in the form of granules) into the locus of the plants. In the case of paddy rice crops, this can also be accomplished by metering the compound of the formula (I) in a solid application form (for example as granules) into a flooded paddy field.
Seed Treatment
The control of animal pests by the treatment of the seed of plants has long been known and is the subject of constant improvements. However, the treatment of seed entails a series of problems which cannot always be solved in a satisfactory manner. Thus, it is desirable to develop methods for protecting the seed and the germinating plant which dispense with, or at least reduce considerably, the additional application of pesticides during storage, after sowing or after emergence of the plants. It is additionally desirable to optimize the amount of active compound used so as to provide optimum protection for the seed and the germinating plant from attack by animal pests, but without damage to the plant itself by the active compound used. In particular, methods for the treatment of seed should also take account of the intrinsic insecticidal or nematicidal properties of pest-resistant or -tolerant transgenic plants in order to achieve optimal protection of the seed and the germinating plant with a minimum expenditure of pesticides.
The present invention therefore in particular also relates to a method for the protection of seed and germinating plants from attack by pests, by treating the seed with one of the compounds of the formula (I). The method according to the invention for protecting seed and germinating plants against attack by pests further comprises a method in which the seed is treated simultaneously in one operation or sequentially with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. It further also comprises a method where the seed is treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component.
The invention likewise relates to the use of the compounds of the formula (I) for the treatment of seed for protecting the seed and the resulting plant from animal pests.
The invention further relates to seed which has been treated with a compound of the formula (I) for protection from animal pests. The invention also relates to seed which has been treated simultaneously with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. The invention further relates to seed which has been treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component. In the case of seed which has been treated at different times with a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component, the individual substances may be present on the seed in different layers. In this case, the layers comprising a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component may optionally be separated by an intermediate layer. The invention also relates to seed in which a compound of the formula (I) and a mixing component have been applied as part of a coating or as a further layer or further layers in addition to a coating.
The invention further relates to seed which, after the treatment with a compound of the formula (I), is subjected to a film-coating process to prevent dust abrasion on the seed.
One of the advantages encountered with a systemically acting compound of the formula (I) is the fact that, by treating the seed, not only the seed itself but also the plants resulting therefrom are, after emergence, protected against animal pests. In this way, the immediate treatment of the crop at the time of sowing or shortly thereafter can be dispensed with.
A further advantage is that the treatment of the seed with a compound of the formula (I) can enhance germination and emergence of the treated seed.
It is likewise considered to be advantageous that compounds of the formula (I) can especially also be used for transgenic seed.
Furthermore, compounds of the formula (I) can be employed in combination with compositions of signalling technology, leading to better colonization by symbionts such as, for example, rhizobia, mycorrhizae and/or endophytic bacteria or fungi, and/or to optimized nitrogen fixation.
The compounds of the formula (I) are suitable for protection of seed of any plant variety which is used in agriculture, in the greenhouse, in forests or in horticulture. More particularly, this includes seed of cereals (for example wheat, barley, rye, millet and oats), maize, cotton, soya beans, rice, potatoes, sunflowers, coffee, tobacco, canola, oilseed rape, beet (for example sugar beet and fodder beet), peanuts, vegetables (for example tomatoes, cucumbers, beans, cruciferous vegetables, onions and lettuce), fruit plants, lawns and ornamental plants. Of particular significance is the treatment of the seed of cereals (such as wheat, barley, rye and oats), maize, soya beans, cotton, canola, oilseed rape and rice.
As already mentioned above, the treatment of transgenic seed with a compound of the formula (I) is also of particular importance. This involves the seed of plants which generally contain at least one heterologous gene which controls the expression of a polypeptide having insecticidal and/or nematicidal properties in particular. The heterologous genes in transgenic seed may originate in this case from microorganisms such as Bacillus, Rhizobium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, Trichoderma, Clavibacter, Glomus or Gliocladium. The present invention is particularly suitable for the treatment of transgenic seed containing at least one heterologous gene originating from Bacillus sp. The heterologous gene is more preferably derived from Bacillus thuringiensis.
In the context of the present invention, the compound of the formula (I) is applied to the seed. The seed is preferably treated in a state in which it is sufficiently stable for no damage to occur in the course of treatment. In general, the seed can be treated at any time between harvest and sowing. It is customary to use seed which has been separated from the plant and freed from cobs, shells, stalks, coats, hairs or the flesh of the fruits. For example, it is possible to use seed which has been harvested, cleaned and dried down to a moisture content which allows storage. Alternatively, it is also possible to use seed which, after drying, has been treated with, for example, water and then dried again, for example priming. In the case of rice seed, it is also possible to use seed which has been pre-swollen in water up to a certain stage (pigeon breast stage) for example, which leads to improved germination and more uniform emergence.
When treating the seed, care must generally be taken that the amount of the compound of the formula (I) applied to the seed and/or the amount of further additives is chosen in such a way that the germination of the seed is not adversely affected, or that the resulting plant is not damaged. This has to be ensured particularly in the case of active compounds which can exhibit phytotoxic effects at certain application rates.
In general, the compounds of the formula (I) are applied to the seed in the form of a suitable formulation. Suitable formulations and processes for seed treatment are known to the person skilled in the art.
The compounds of the formula (I) can be converted to the customary seed-dressing formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, slurries or other coating compositions for seed, and also ULV formulations.
These formulations are prepared in a known manner, by mixing compounds of the formula (I) with customary additives such as, for example, customary extenders and also solvents or diluents, dyes, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, antifoams, preservatives, secondary thickeners, adhesives, gibberellins and also water.
Dyes which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all dyes which are customary for such purposes. It is possible to use either pigments, which are sparingly soluble in water, or dyes, which are soluble in water. Examples include the dyes known by the names Rhodamine B, C.I. Pigment Red 112 and C.I. Solvent Red 1.
Useful wetting agents which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which promote wetting and which are customary for the formulation of agrochemically active compounds. Alkyl naphthalenesulphonates, such as diisopropyl or diisobutyl naphthalenesulphonates, can be used with preference.
Suitable dispersants and/or emulsifiers which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all nonionic, anionic and cationic dispersants customary for the formulation of agrochemically active compounds. Nonionic or anionic dispersants or mixtures of nonionic or anionic dispersants/can be used with preference. Suitable nonionic dispersants include in particular ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block polymers, alkylphenol polyglycol ethers and tristyrylphenol polyglycol ethers, and the phosphated or sulphated derivatives thereof. Suitable anionic dispersants are especially lignosulphonates, polyacrylic acid salts and arylsulphonate-formaldehyde condensates.
Antifoams which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all foam-inhibiting substances customary for the formulation of agrochemically active compounds. Silicone antifoams and magnesium stearate can be used with preference.
Preservatives which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances usable for such purposes in agrochemical compositions. Examples include dichlorophene and benzyl alcohol hemiformal.
Secondary thickeners which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all substances which can be used for such purposes in agrochemical compositions.
Preferred examples include cellulose derivatives, acrylic acid derivatives, xanthan, modified clays and finely divided silica.
Useful stickers which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are all customary binders usable in seed-dressing products. Preferred examples include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol and tylose.
Gibberellins which may be present in the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention are preferably the gibberellins A1, A3 (=gibberellic acid), A4 and A7; particular preference is given to using gibberellic acid. The gibberellins are known (cf. R. Wegler “Chemie der Pflanzenschutz-und Schädlingsbekämpfungsmittel”, vol. 2, Springer Verlag, 1970, pp. 401-412).
The seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be used to treat a wide variety of different kinds of seed, either directly or after prior dilution with water. For instance, the concentrates or the preparations obtainable therefrom by dilution with water can be used to dress the seed of cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, and triticale, and also the seed of maize, rice, oilseed rape, peas, beans, cotton, sunflowers, soya beans and beets, or else a wide variety of different vegetable seed. The seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or the dilute use forms thereof, can also be used to dress seed of transgenic plants.
For the treatment of seed with the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention, or use forms prepared therefrom, all mixing units usable customarily for the seed dressing are useful. Specifically, the procedure in seed dressing is to place the seed into a mixer in batchwise or continuous operation, to add the particular desired amount of seed-dressing formulations, either as such or after prior dilution with water, and to mix until the formulation is distributed homogeneously on the seed. If appropriate, this is followed by a drying operation.
The application rate of the seed-dressing formulations usable in accordance with the invention can be varied within a relatively wide range. It is guided by the particular content of the compounds of the formula (I) in the formulations and by the seed. The application rates of the compound of the formula (I) are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 15 g per kilogram of seed.
Animal Health
In the animal health field, i.e. the field of veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula (I) are active against animal parasites, in particular ectoparasites or endoparasites. The term “endoparasites” includes especially helminths and protozoa, such as coccidia. Ectoparasites are typically and preferably arthropods, especially insects and acarids.
In the field of veterinary medicine, the compounds of the formula (I) having favourable homeotherm toxicity are suitable for controlling parasites which occur in animal breeding and animal husbandry in livestock, breeding animals, zoo animals, laboratory animals, experimental animals and domestic animals. They are active against all or specific stages of development of the parasites.

The pathogens can be transmitted either mechanically (for example trachoma by non-stinging flies) to a host or after injection (for example malaria parasites by mosquitoes) into a host.
Examples of vectors and the diseases or pathogens they transmit are:
1) mosquitoesAnopheles: malaria, filariosis;Culex: Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, other viral diseases, transmission of worms;Aedes: yellow fever, dengue fever, filariasis, other viral diseases;Simulidae: transmission of worms, in particular Onchocerca volvulus; 2) lice: skin infections, epidemic typhus;3) fleas: plague, endemic typhus;4) flies: sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis); cholera, other bacterial diseases;5) mites: acariosis, epidemic typhus, rickettsialpox, tularaemia, Saint Louis encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, borreliosis;6) ticks: borellioses such as Borrelia duttoni, tick-borne encephalitis, Q fever (Coxiella burnetii), babesioses (Babesia canis canis).
Examples of vectors in the context of the present invention are insects, such as aphids, flies, leafhoppers or thrips, which can transmit plant viruses to plants. Other vectors capable of transmitting plant viruses are spider mites, lice, beetles and nematodes.
Further examples of vectors in the context of the present invention are insects and arachnids such as mosquitoes, especially of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, for example A. gambiae, A. arabiensis, A. funestus, A. dirus (malaria) and Culex, lice, fleas, flies, mites and ticks, which can transmit pathogens to animals and/or humans.

LC-MS determination in the neutral range is effected at pH 7.8 with 0.001 molar aqueous ammonium hydrogencarbonate solution and acetonitrile as eluents; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 95% acetonitrile. Called log P (neutral) in the table.
Calibration is carried out using unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon atoms) with known log P values (log P values determined on the basis of the retention times by linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).
The NMR data of selected examples are listed either in conventional form (δ values, multiplet splitting, number of hydrogen atoms) or as NMR peak lists.
In each case, the solvent in which the NMR spectrum was recorded is stated.
NMR Peak List Method
The 1H NMR data of selected examples are stated in the form of 1H NMR peak lists. For each signal peak, first the δ value in ppm and then the signal intensity in round brackets are listed. The pairs of δ value-signal intensity numbers for different signal peaks are listed with separation from one another by semicolons.
The peak list for one example therefore has the form of:
δ1 (intensity1); δ2 (intensity2); . . . ; δi (intensityi); . . . ; δn (intensityn)
The intensity of sharp signals correlates with the height of the signals in a printed example of an NMR spectrum in cm and shows the true ratios of the signal intensities. In the case of broad signals, several peaks or the middle of the signal and the relative intensity thereof may be shown in comparison to the most intense signal in the spectrum.
Calibration of the chemical shift of 1H NMR spectra is accomplished using tetramethylsilane and/or the chemical shift of the solvent, particularly in the case of spectra which are measured in DMSO. Therefore, the tetramethylsilane peak may but need not occur in NMR peak lists.
The lists of the 1H NMR peaks are similar to the conventional 1H-NMR printouts and thus usually contain all peaks listed in a conventional NMR interpretation.
In addition, like conventional 1H NMR printouts, they may show solvent signals, signals of stereoisomers of the target compounds which likewise form part of the subject-matter of the invention, and/or peaks of impurities.
In the reporting of compound signals within the delta range of solvents and/or water, our lists of 1H NMR peaks show the standard solvent peaks, for example peaks of DMSO in DMSO-D6 and the peak of water, which usually have a high intensity on average.
The peaks of stereoisomers of the target compounds and/or peaks of impurities usually have a lower intensity on average than the peaks of the target compounds (for example with a purity of >90%).
Such stereoisomers and/or impurities may be typical of the particular preparation process. Their peaks can thus help in this case to identify reproduction of our preparation process with reference to “by-product fingerprints”.
An expert calculating the peaks of the target compounds by known methods (MestreC, ACD simulation, but also with empirically evaluated expected values) can, if required, isolate the peaks of the target compounds, optionally using additional intensity filters. This isolation would be similar to the peak picking in question in conventional 1H NMR interpretation.
Further details of 1H NMR peak lists can be found in the Research Disclosure Database Number 564025

Ctenocephalides felis-In Vitro Contact Tests with Adult Cat Fleas
For the coating of the test tubes, 9 mg of active compound are first dissolved in 1 ml of acetone p.a. and then diluted to the desired concentration with acetone p.a. 250 μl of the solution are distributed homogeneously on the inner walls and the base of a 25 ml test tube by turning and rocking on an orbital shaker (rocking rotation at 30 rpm for 2 h). With 900 ppm active compound solution and internal surface 44.7 cm2, given homogeneous distribution, an area-based dose of 5 μg/cm2 is achieved.
After the solvent has evaporated off, the tubes are populated with 5-10 adult cat fleas (Ctenocephalides felis), sealed with a perforated plastic lid and incubated in a horizontal position at room temperature and ambient humidity. After 48 h, efficacy is determined. To this end, the test tubes are stood upright and the fleas are knocked to the base of the tube. Fleas which remain motionless at the base or move in an uncoordinated manner are considered to be dead or moribund.
A substance shows good efficacy against Ctenocephalides felis if at least 80% efficacy was achieved in this test at an application rate of 5 μg/cm2. 100% efficacy means that all the fleas were dead or moribund. 0% efficacy means that no fleas were harmed.
