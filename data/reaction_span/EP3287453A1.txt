TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to an imidazole compound, specifically relates to a compound represented by formula (I), a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or tautomer thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE PRESENT INVENTION
Ischemic cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke) is due to the temporary or permanent reduction of blood supply to an arterial area caused by embolism or bleeding, its pathological process involves complicated time and spatial cascade reaction, and the mechanism is related to Ca2+ overload, free radical damage and other factors. Ozagrel Sodium shows a specific inhibitory action on thromboxane-A synthase, resulting in pharmacological effects such as anti-platelet aggregation and dilation of blood vessels. In addition, Ozagrel exhibits the ability to reduce the generation of free radicals through the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and to remove directly free radicals leading to improved tolerance of brain tissue to hypoxia conditions. It was widely used in the treatment of ischemic cerebrovascular diseases including acute cerebral infarction, and achieved significant effect.
Ozagrel was developed as a novel anti-platelet drug by Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in the Japan. In 1989, it was introduced to the market (CataclotÂ®) for the first specific thromboxane synthase A2 (TXA2) inhibitor. It inhibits the conversion of prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) derived from platelet into thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and thereby promotes the generation of prostaglandin PGI2, which was synthesized from PGH2 in endothelial cell. By way of improving the balance between TXA2 and PGI2, the drug achieves the therapeutic effect of ischemic cerebrovascular disease.
The structure of Ozagrel is as follows:<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>

The phrase "pharmaceutically acceptable" is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is meant to include a salt of a compound of the present invention which is prepared by a relatively nontoxic acid or base with the compound of the present invention having particular substituents. When the compound of the present invention contains a relatively acidic functional group, a base addition salt can be obtained by contacting a neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of a desired base, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, organic amine, or magnesium, or similar salts. When the compound of the present invention contains a relatively basic functional group, an acid addition salt can be obtained by contacting a neutral form of such compounds with a sufficient amount of a desired acid, either neat or in a suitable inert solvent. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include salts of inorganic acids including hydrochloric, hydrobromic, nitric, carbonic, hydrocarbonic, phosphoric, hydrophosphoric, dihydrophosphoric, sulfuric, hydrosulfuric, hydriodic, or phosphorous acids and the like; as well as salts of organic acids including acetic, propionic, isobutyric, maleic, malonic, benzoic, succinic, suberic, fumaric, lactic, mandelic, phthalic, benzenesulfonic, p-tolylsulfonic, citric, tartaric, methanesulfonic acid, or the like; and also salts of amino acids (such as arginate and the like), and salts of organic acids like glucuronic acid and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", Journal of Pharmaceutical Science 66: 1-19 (1977)). Certain specific compounds of the present invention contain both basic and acidic functionalities that allow the compounds to be converted into either base or acid addition salts.
The neutral form of the compound is preferably regenerated by contacting the salt with a base or acid and then isolating the parent compounds in the conventional manner. The parent form of the compound differs from the various salt forms thereof in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents.
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to derivatives of the compound of the present invention wherein the parent compound is modified by making a salt with an acid or base. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, inorganic or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non- toxic inorganic or organic acids. Such conventional non-toxic salts include, but are not limited to, those derived from inorganic and organic acids selected from 2-acetoxybenzoic, 2-hydroxyethane sulfonic, acetic, ascorbic, benzene sulfonic, benzoic, bicarbonic, carbonic, citric, edetic, ethane disulfonic, ethane sulfonic, fumaric, glucoheptonic, gluconic, glutamic, glycolic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodide, hydroxyl acids, hydroxynaphthoic, isethionate, lactic, lactobionic, lauryl sulfonic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methane sulfonic, nitric acid, oxalic acid, pamoic pamoic acid, pantothenic, phenylacetic, phosphoric, polygalacturonic, propionic, salicyclic, stearic, folinate, succinic, sulfamic, sulfanilic, sulfuric acid, tannic, tartaric, and p-toluene sulfonic acid.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile or the like are preferred.
In addition to salt forms, the present invention also provides compounds which are in a prodrug form. Prodrugs of the compounds described herein readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compounds of the present invention. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound of the present invention by chemical or biochemical methods in an in vivo environment.
Certain compounds of the present invention can exist in unsolvated forms or solvated forms, including hydrated forms. In general, the solvated forms are equivalent to unsolvated forms and all are encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
Certain compounds of the present invention may possess asymmetric carbon atoms (optical centers) or double bonds. The racemates, diastereomers, geometric isomers and individual isomers are all encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are taken from Maehr, J. Chem. Ed. 1985, 62: 114-120. Solid wedge and broken wedge are used to denote the absolute configuration of a stereocenter unless otherwise noted. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are included.
Compounds of the present invention can exist in particular geometric or stereoisomeric forms. The invention contemplates all such compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (-)- and (+)-enantiomers, (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, diastereomers, (D)-isomers, (L)-isomers, the racemic mixtures thereof, and other mixtures thereof, such as enantiomerically or diastereomerically enriched mixtures, and all these mixtures as falling within the scope of the invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms can be present in a substituent such as an alkyl group. All such isomers, as well as mixtures thereof, are intended to be included in this invention.
Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers and D and L isomers can be prepared by chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or other conventional techniques. If, a particular enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, it can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis, or by derivatization with a chiral auxiliary, where the resultant diastereomeric mixture is separated and the auxiliary group is cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomers. Alternatively, where the molecule contains a basic functional group (such as an amino group) or an acidic functional group (such as a carboxyl group), diastereomeric salts can be formed with an appropriate optically active acid or base, followed by resolution of the diastereomers by general means known in the art, and subsequent recovery of the pure enantiomers. In addition, separation of enantiomers and diastereomers is frequently accomplished by chromatography employing chiral, stationary phases, optionally in combination with chemical derivatization (e.g., formation of carbamates from amines).
The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of the atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention, regardless of radioactivity or not, are intended to be encompassed within the scope of the present invention.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any formulation or carrier medium that is capable of delivery of an effective amount of an active agent of the present invention, and does not interfere with the biological activity of the active agent, without toxic side effects in a host or patient. Representative carriers include water, oils, both vegetable and mineral, cream bases, lotion bases, ointment bases and the like. These bases include suspending agents, thickeners, penetration enhancers, and the like. Their formulation is well known to those in the art of cosmetics and topical pharmaceuticals. Additional information concerning carriers can be found in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005), which is incorporated herein by reference.
The term "excipients" conventionally means carriers, diluents and/or vehicles needed in formulating effective pharmaceutical compositions.
For drugs or pharmacologically active agents, the terms "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to a nontoxic but sufficient amount of the drug or agent to provide the desired effect. In the oral dosage forms of the present disclosure, an "effective amount" of an active angent of the composition refers to the amount of the activeagent required to provide the desired effect when used in combination with the other active agent of the composition. The amount that is "effective" will vary from subject to subject, depending on the age and general condition of a recipient, and also a particular active agent, and an appropriate effective amount in an individual case may be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art using routine experimentation.
The terms "active ingredient," "therapeutic agent," "active aubstance," or "active agent" mean a chemical entity which can be effective in treating a targeted disorder, disease or condition.
The term "substituted", means that any one or more hydrogens on a designated atom is replaced with a substituent including deuterium and a variant of hydrogen, provided that the designated atom's valency is normal, and that the substituted compound is stable. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., =O), it means that 2 hydrogen atoms are replaced. Oxo substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. The term "optionally substituted" means that the designated atom can be substituted or unsubstituted, and unless otherwise stated, the species and number of the substituents may be arbitrary provided that they can be achieved in chemistry.
When any variable (e.g., R) occurs more than once in the constituent or structure of a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent. Thus, for example, if a group is substituted with 0-2 R(s), then said group may optionally be substituted with up to two R groups and R at each occurrence has independently options. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
When a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom via which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom therein. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
Substituents for the alkyl and heteroalkyl radicals (including the groups commonly named as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl and heterocycloalkenyl) are generically referred to as "alkyl group substituents" and they can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: -R', -OR', =O, =NR', =N-OR', -NR'R", -SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R''', OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -CONR'R", - OC(O)NR'R", -NR"C(O)R', NR' C(O)NR"R''', -NR"C(O)2R', -NR'''''-C(NR'R"R''')=NR'''', NR'''' C(NR'R")=NR''', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R", NR"SO2R', -CN, -NO2, -N3, -CH(Ph)2, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to (2m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such radical. Preferably each of R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' is independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl(e.g., an aryl substituted with 1 to 3 of halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. When a compound of the present invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R" are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R" is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one person skilled in the art will understand that the term "alkyl" is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF3 and -CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH3, -C(O)CF3, -C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like). Similar to the substituents described for the alkyl radical, substituents for the aryl and heteroaryl groups are generically referred to as "aryl group substituents." The substituents are selected from, for example: -R', -OR', -NR'R", - SR', -halogen, -SiR'R"R''', OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -CONR'R", -OC(O)NR'R", - NR"C(O)R', NR' C(O)NR"R''', -NR"C(O)2R', -NR'''''-C(NR'R"R''')=NR'''', NR'''' C(NR'R")=NR''', -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R", NR"SO2R', -CN, -NO2, -N3, -CH(Ph)2, fluoro(C1-C4)alkoxy, and fluoro(C1-C4)alkyl, in a number ranging from zero to the total number of open valences on the aromatic ring system; and wherein each of R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' is preferably and independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. When a compound of the present invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R", R''', R'''' and R''''' groups when more than one of these groups is present.
The two substituents on adjacent atoms of an aryl or heteroaryl ring may be optionally substituted by substituents of the general formula -TC(O)-(CRR')q-U-, wherein each of T and U is independently selected from -NR -, -O-, CRR'- and a single bond, and q is an integer from 0 to 3. Alternatively, the two substituents on adjacent atoms of an aryl or heteroaryl ring may be optionally substituted by substituents of the general formula -A (CH2) rB-, wherein each of A and B is independently selected from -CRR'-, -O-, -NR-, -S-, -S(O)-, S(O)2-, -S(O)2NR'-or a single bond, r is an integer from 1 to 4. Optionally, a single bond on the resulting new ring may be replaced by a double bond. Alternatively, the two substituents on adjacent atoms of an aryl or heteroaryl ring may be optionally substituted by substituents of the general formula -A (CH2) rB-, wherein, each of s and d is independently selected from an integer from 0 to 3, and X is -O-, -NR', -S-, -S(O)-, - S(O)2-or -S(O)2NR'-. Each substituent R, R', R" or R''' is independently selected from hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6) alkyl.
The terms "halo" or "halogen" by themselves or as part of another substituent, mean, unless otherwise stated, a fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine atom. Additionally, terms such as "haloalkyl," are meant to include monohaloalkyl and polyhaloalkyl. For example, the term "halo(C1-C4)alkyl" is mean to include, but not be limited to, trifluoromethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl, 3-bromopropyl, and the like.
Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, and pentachloroethyl. "Alkoxy" represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. C1-6 alkoxy, is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkoxy groups. Examples of alkoxy include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, i-propoxy, n-butoxy, s-butoxy, t-butoxy, n-pentoxy, and s-pentoxy. "Cycloalkyl" is intended to include saturated ring groups, such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, or cyclopentyl. 3-7 cycloalkyl is intended to include C3, C4, C5, C6, and C7 cycloalkyl groups. "Alkenyl" is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either linear or branched configuration and one or more carbon-carbon double bonds that may occur in any stable site along the chain, such as ethenyl and propenyl.
The term "halo" or "halogen" as used herein refers to fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo.
As used herein, the term "hetero", "heteroatom" or "heteroatomic radical" (namely radical containing heteroatom), unless otherwise stated, include atoms other than carbon (C) and hydrogen (H), also include the radicals containing these aforesaid heteroatoms. Examples include oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) sulfur (S), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al) and boron (B) etc., also include optionally substituted -C(=O)N(H)-, -N(H)-, -C(=NH)-, -S(=O)2 N(H)-, or -S(=O) N(H)-.
"Ring or cyclo" means a substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, a substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or a substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. The so-called ring includes fused ring. The number of atoms in a ring is typically defined as the number of members of the ring. For example, a "5- to 7-membered ring" means there are 5 to 7 atoms in the encircling arrangement. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally includes one to three heteroatoms. Thus, the term "5- to 7-membered ring" includes, for example phenyl, pyridinyl and piperidinyl. The term "5- to 7-membered heterocycloalkyl ring", on the other hand, include pyridinyl and piperidinyl, but not phenyl. The term "ring" further includes a ring system comprising at least one ring, wherein each "ring" is independently defined as above.
The term "heterocycle" or "heterocyclo-" is intended to mean a stable monocyclic, or a bicyclic, or a heterobicyclic, which may be saturated, partially unsaturated or unsaturated (aromatic), and include carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 of ring heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S in which any of the above-defined heterocyclic rings may be fused to a benzene ring to form a bicyclic group. The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i. e., NO and S (O) p). The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents, already defined herein). The heterocyclic ring may be attached to its side group at any heteroatom or carbon atom that results in a stable structure. The heterocyclic rings described herein may be substituted on carbon or on a nitrogen atom if the resultant compound is stable. A nitrogen in the heterocycle may optionally be quaternized. In a preferred embodiment, when the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle exceeds 1, then these heteroatoms are not adjacent to one another. In another preferred embodiment the total number of S and O atoms in the heterocycle is not more than 1. As used herein, the term "aromatic heterocyclic group" or "heteroaryl" is intended to mean a stable 5-, 6-, or 7-membered monocyclic or bicyclic or 7-, 8-, 9-, or 10-membered bicyclic heterocyclic aromatic ring which includes carbon atoms and 1, 2, 3, or 4 of heterotams independently selected from the group consisting of N, O and S. The nitrogen atom may be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e., N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituents already defined herein). The nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized (i.e., NO and S (O) p). It is to be noted that total number of S and O atoms in the aromatic heterocycle is not more than 1. Bridged rings are also included in the definition of heterocycle. A bridged ring occurs when one or more atoms (i.e., C, O, N, or S) link two non-adjacent carbon or nitrogen atoms.

Study Example 1: Study for the release of TXB2 in the in-vitro coagulation process of rats' whole blood.
Principle:
In the in-vitro coagulation process, thromboxane A2 (TXA2) pathway was activated, resulting in the formation of large amounts of TXA2, which were rapidly metabolized to its stable form thromboxane B2 (TXB2).
The key enzyme of this pathway was thromboxane synthase. The generation of TXA2 could be inhibited by blocking this enzyme with specific inhibitors (tested compounds), and the level of TXB2 was thus decreased.
The activity of tested compound was measured with the IC50 of inhibiting the formation of TBX2.
Animals:
Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd.
Reagents:
0.9% normal saline, 100 M NaOH solution (vehicle), 100 uM thromboxane synthetase inhibitor solution, isoflurane
Procedure and Method:
1. Tested compound was dissolved by normal saline and prepared to required concentration by gradient dilution. 167 uL of prepared solution was added to centrifuge tube.2. Whole blood was collected from the heart of male SD rat after isoflurane anesthesia, added to centrifuge tube (0.5 mL), shaken up and incubated under 37Â°C water bath for 30 mins until complete coagulation.3. Centrifuge tube was taken out and centrifuged for 5 mins (6000g, 4Â°C) to get serum.4. Assay the content of TXB2 by LC-MS/MS-AG (API 4000).
Data and Analysis:
By comparison with the vehicle group, TXB2 contents of each sample were normalized to Control% by the formule:<img> id-imgb0144.tif </img>Control%=TBX2 level in test tubeâTBX2 level in negative tube/TBX2 level in control tubeÃ100Note: Test tube: solution of tested compound with series concentrationNegative tube: solution of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor at high concentration (100 uM)Control tube: vehicle
Using GraphPad Prism (concentration as X-axis and Control% as Y-axis) to fit the data and calculate IC50.
The result was shown in table 1:
