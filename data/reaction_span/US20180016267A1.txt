BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to compounds, which act both as muscarinic receptor antagonists and beta2 adrenergic receptor agonists. The present invention also relates to processes for the preparation of such a compound, compositions which contain such a compound, therapeutic uses of such a compound, and combinations of such a compound with other pharmaceutical active ingredients.
Discussion of the Background
Pulmonary disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are commonly treated with bronchodilators. A well-known class of bronchodilators consists of beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as salbutamol, fenoterol, formoterol and salmeterol. These compounds are generally administered by inhalation.
Another well-known class of bronchodilators consists of muscarinic receptor antagonists (anticholinergic compounds), such as ipratropium and tiotropium. These compounds are also typically administered by inhalation.
Inhaled formulations of both beta-2 agonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists are valuable agents in the treatment of asthma and COPD, with both classes of agents providing symptomatic relief due to their ability to relax constricted airways. Observations that the bronchodilator effects of the two classes of agents were additive, prompted studies with combinations of the two agents. In 1975, it was shown that beneficial effects could be achieved by combining two ingredients such as fenoterol and ipratropium bromide in a single aerosol. This prompted the development of fixed dose combinations of ipratropium bromide firstly with fenoterol (Berodual, introduced in 1980), and then with salbutamol (Combivent, introduced in 1994).
More recently the availability of both long-acting muscarinic antagonists and long-acting beta-2 agonists prompted to the development of combinations of these agents. For example, WO 00/69468, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses medicament compositions containing a muscarinic receptor antagonist, such as tiotropium bromide, and beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as formoterol fumarate or salmeterol, and WO 2005/115467, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, discloses a combination which comprises a beta-2 agonist and an antagonist of M3 muscarinic receptors which is a salt of 3(R)-(2-hydroxy-2,2-dithien-2-ylacetoxy)-1-(3-phenoxypropyl)-1-azoniabicyclo[2.2.2]octane.
An alternative approach to the development of fixed dose combinations is the identification of molecules that combine both activities of muscarinic antagonism and beta-2 agonism. In fact compounds possessing both beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity are highly desirable since such bifunctional compounds would provide bronchodilation through two independent mechanisms of action while having a single molecule pharmacokinetics.
Such kind of compounds was described in some patent applications, such as WO 2004/074246, WO 2004/074812, WO 2005/051946, WO 2006/023457, WO 2006/023460, WO 2010/123766, WO 2011/048409 WO 2012/168349, WO 2012/168359, WO2014/086924, WO 2014/086927 and co-pending patent application PCT/EP2016/052812, all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
It has now been found that some particular phenyl hydroxyacetic ester derivatives, besides possessing both beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity, possess elevated affinity for the M3 muscarinic receptors and long lasting bronchodilating activity.
However, there remains a need for compounds which act both as muscarinic receptor antagonists and beta2 adrenergic receptor agonists.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide novel compounds which act both as muscarinic receptor antagonists and beta2 adrenergic receptor agonists.
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel processes for the preparation of such a compound.
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel compositions which contain such a compound.
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel therapeutic uses of such a compound.
It is another object of the present invention to provide novel combinations of such a compound with other pharmaceutical active ingredients.
These and other objects, which will become apparent during the following detailed description, have been achieved by the inventors' discovery that some particular phenyl hydroxyacetic ester derivatives, besides possessing both beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonist and muscarinic receptor antagonist activity, possess elevated affinity for the M3 muscarinic receptors and long lasting bronchodilating activity.
Thus, the present invention provides compounds of general formula I which, act both as muscarinic receptor antagonists and beta2 adrenergic receptor agonists, processes for the preparation of such a compound, compositions which contain such a compound, therapeutic uses of such a compound, and combinations of such a compound with other pharmaceutical active ingredients among which are, for instance, those currently used in the treatment of respiratory disorders, e.g. corticosteroids, P38 MAP kinase inhibitors, IKK2, HNE inhibitors, PDE4 inhibitors, leukotriene modulators, NSAIDs and mucus regulators.

The compounds of the present invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures or by using other information readily available to those of ordinary skill in the art. Although a particular embodiment of the present invention may be shown or described herein, those skilled in the art will recognize that all embodiments or aspects of the invention can be prepared using the methods described herein or by using other known methods, reagents and starting materials. When typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless stated otherwise. While the optimum reaction conditions may vary depending on the particular reactants or solvent used, such conditions can be readily determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.
Compounds of general formula I may be prepared according to the following synthetic Scheme.
General Procedure for the Preparation of Compounds of Formula I
Compounds of formula I are compounds in which Y is a divalent group -A1-B-A2-C-(CH2)n-.
The synthesis of compounds of formula I may require the protection of potential reactive functionalities in addition to those methods herewith described. Examples of compatible protecting groups (PG) and their particular methods of protection and deprotection are described in “Protecting groups in organic Synthesis” by T. W. Green and P. Wutz (Wiley-Interscience publication, 1999), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.
Compounds I can be prepared for example according to general Scheme 1B by reaction of a compound of general formula XVII with a compound of formula XXIV. This reductive amination reaction can be performed following several different protocols described in the literature. For example, it can be performed in solvents such as methanol, ethanol, tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dichloromethane (DCM) using a reducing agent such as NaBH4, NaCNBH3 or NaB(AcO)3H. t could be useful to pre-form the imine before adding the reducing agent. The reaction proceeds smoothly at room temperature (RT) over 1 to 12 hours. The reaction can be done on XXIV wherein the protecting group PG is still present or already removed during its synthesis. In the first case, the reductive amination must be followed by an additional step for the removal of PG. Reaction conditions depend on the nature of PG.
The intermediate XVII can be easily prepared by reaction of a compound XVIII with a compound of formula VII under the well-known Suzuki cross-coupling reaction conditions. LG1 is a leaving group such as iodine, bromine, chlorine or triflate that reacts with a boronic acid or ester in the presence of a metal catalyst such as Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(dppf)Cl2 or other Pd catalysts. The presence and the nature of organic phosphines is crucial to promote the reaction that occurs in solvents such as DMF, 1,4-dioxane or ACN at a temperature ranging from 80 to 120° C. The reaction completes in 1 to 12 hours. Compound XVIII represents a compound wherein A1 is alkylene substituted with oxo, leading to an aldehyde or ketone, protected as acetal or cyclic acetal.
In few cases the reaction can be performed reacting compound VII and a compound XVIII wherein the group D is functionalized with a group like LG1. In this case, the cross-coupling reaction occurs in the presence of hypodiboric acid and a reactive catalytic system such as X-Phos-Pd-G2 and X-Phos. Both reaction described allow the formation of the C-C bond between generic group D and G.
A following step for the deprotection of the acetal on A1 gives the compound of formula XVII.
A compound of formula VII can be used for the synthesis of a compound of formula XX by mean of a reaction with a compound of formula XIX under the same cross-coupling reaction conditions described above that, followed by the hydrolysis of the ester, lead to the compound of formula XX. Compound of formula XX can be reacted with a compound of formula XXI, wherein A2 is absent and B is heterocycloalkyl-ene divalent group containing at least one nitrogen atom, under the known condensation conditions for the preparation of amides. The reaction occurs smoothly in an aprotic polar solvent such as DCM, THF or DMF at room or higher temperature in the presence of a condensing agent such as EDC, DCC, HATU. Alternatively the acid XX can be converted into the corresponding chloride (e.g. with COCl2 in DMC) or imidazolide (with CDI in DCM or DMF) and then treated with XXI. A similar reaction can also be performed with a compound of formula XXI wherein the terminal -A1-B-A2 is functionalized with a pending amino group of formula -NH-R7.
The presence of OH and NH moiety, for example in a compound of formula XXI, can affect the formation of the compound I as these functional groups can compete in the reaction of amide formation. For this reason, it is worth considering performing such described reaction, for the conversion of XX into I, using intermediate XXI in which the OH and NH are protected with suitable protecting group (PG). For the purpose silyl ethers for the OH and carbamates for the NH are well known protecting groups, whose selection should not be limited to them as it often depends on the complexity of the molecule and the presence of other functional groups in Y that can be not compatible with the reaction conditions required for introduction or removal of protecting groups. A similar consideration applies to the carbostiryl moiety that contains a phenolic OH. In this case, its reactivity can suggests protection to avoid any competitive reaction and formation of by-products. Benzyl is a suitable protecting group. The specific sequence of reaction for the preparation of I might be different from case to case, those skilled in the art will readily recognize the more appropriate sequence considering the structure of linker Y.
In another embodiment, the compound of the invention can be prepared reacting a compound of general formula XV with a compound of formula XI under the same reaction condition used for the amide formation described above, followed by deprotection of PG if required.
Compounds of formula XV can also be reacted under same reaction condition with a compound of formula X to generate a compound of formula XXVIII. This boronic acid, or alternatively an analogue boronic ester, like for example pinacolate, can be then reacted with a compound of formula VII to provide, in an alternative way, a compound of formula I under the same reaction condition described above for the Suzuki coupling of compound of formula XVIII with a compound of formula VII.
Reactions described above start from a compound of formula XVI that can be prepared in different ways. For example, it can be synthesized reacting a compound of formula XXIV with a compound of formula XXV under reductive amination conditions described for the reaction of compound XVII with a compound XXIV, followed by the hydrolysis of the ester. The latter well-known reaction can accomplished by using alkaline hydroxides in polar solvent, such as MeOH, EtOH or THF mixed with water in a suitable ratio. The reaction occurs at RT, but higher temperature can speed the reaction up that can complete in a time ranging from 30 minutes to overnight. Alternatively, compound of formula XV can be prepared reacting a compound of formula XXII, wherein LG is a leaving group such as chlorine or bromine, with a compound of formula XXVI under nucleophilic substitution (SN) condition. The reaction occurs in a polar solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile or DMF at a temperature ranging from 50 to 120° C. and can be accelerated by the presence of potassium iodide. The same reaction can be used to react a compound of formula XXII with a compound of formula XXVII wherein LG1 is a group such as iodine, bromine or triflate. The latter could be instable under the nucleophilic substitution reaction condition and for this reason the reaction can be performed using the phenol precursor of triflate that, after SN, can be easily obtained treating the phenol with trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride or other triflating agent such as 2-[N,N-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amino]-5-chloropyridine, in polar solvent such as DCM or THF at low temperature in the presence of a base such as, but not limited to, DMAP or TEA. Compound XXX obtained can be then converted into compound XVI by mean of carbonatation. This reaction can be accomplished treating first compound XXX with an alkyl lithium in a polar solvent such as, but not limited to THF, at low temperature (typically −78° C.) and then with dry gaseous carbon dioxide. The same conversion can be accomplished using a palladium catalyzed reaction and phenyl formate. The most widely used catalytic system is formed by Palladium diacetate, an organic phosphine, such as but not limited to 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene, and an organic base such as triethylamine. The reaction occurs in an aprotic solvent such as toluene or trifluoro-toluene at a temperature ranging from 80 to 120° C. and completes over a period of time ranging from 4 to 24 hours.
Compound of formula XXIV can be obtained by simple reduction of the azide XXIII. The reaction can be accomplished by mean of a catalytic hydrogenation in the presence Palladium catalyst. The reaction occurs, in polar solvent such as methanol or ethanol, under hydrogen atmosphere or under hydrogen transfer condition, using for example 1,4-cyclohexadiene or 1-methyl1,4-cyclohexadiene as source of hydrogen. The reaction proceeds at room temperature. In case it is performed under hydrogen transfer conditions higher temperature can be required. Alternatively, the conversion can be accomplished under Staudinger reaction conditions that does not cleave the benzyl group. The azide XXIII can be easily prepared from XXII by the well-known nucleophilic substitution of alkyl bromide with alkaline azide. The reaction proceeds at a temperature ranging from 50 to 80° C. and in a polar solvent such as DMF of NMP and can be accelerated by the presence of alkaline iodide.
In another embodiment the compounds of the invention can be prepared according to General Scheme 1A reacting a compound of formula XI with a compound of formula XV under the amide formation reaction condition described above for the reaction of a compound of formula XX with a compound of formula XXI.
The compounds of formula XI can be easily obtained from a compound of formula XIV that is first hydrolyzed to convert the ester into the corresponding carboxylic acid and then reacted with a compound of formula R-O-L-R2. The structure of group R determines the reaction conditions. In case R is hydrogen, the reaction is the well-known condensation used for the preparation of esters. The reaction occurs smoothly in an aprotic polar solvent such as DCM, THF or DMF at room or higher temperature in the presence of a condensing agent such as EDC, DCC, HATU. Alternatively the acid XI can be converted into the corresponding chloride (e.g. with COCl2 in DMC) or imidazolide (with CDI in DCM or DMF) and then treated with alcohol of formula HO-L-R2. In case R is Tosyl or Mesyl the conversion of the carboxylic acid into XI is an alkylation of carboxylic acid and can be achieved in many different ways. For example, the group TosO in a compound of formula TosO-L-R2 can be easily displaced reacting the two compounds in a polar solvent such as, but not limited to, ACN or DMF, for one or more hours at room or higher temperature in the presence of a base such as sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate.
In a slightly different approach, the same set of reactions can be used to convert a compound of formula XIV into compound of formula I. In this approach, compound of formula XIV is first reacted with a compound of formula XV to give compound XVI, then hydrolyzed and then reacted with a compound of formula R-O-L-R2 as described above.
Compound of formula XI can be prepared reacting a compound of general formula VII with a compound of formula X under cross coupling reaction condition described for the reaction of compound VII with a compound XVIII. The same reaction can be used to prepare compounds of formula XIV reacting a compound of formula IX with a compound of formula X.
The compounds of formula VII can also be converted into a compound of formula XII by reaction with bispinacolate diboron in the presence of a palladium catalyst such as Pd(ddpf)2Cl2 and potassium acetate in polar solvent such as DMSO at 80-100° C. Compound XII can be then converted into a compound of formula XI, as described above, by mean of a cross coupling reaction. In few cases, it could be also possible react a compound VII with a compound XIII as described for the reaction of compound VII with compound XVIII wherein the group D is functionalized with a group like LG1 reactive under cross coupling reaction condition.
The compound of formula VII can be easily obtained from a compound of formula IX following the same approach used for the preparation of compound XI from compound XIV.
Compound of formula IX can be obtained using the addition of Grignard reagent (or other metal derivatives) to keto-containing compounds such as VIII or II. The selection of one of the two possible reactions depends on the availability of suitable Grignard's reagent or a precursor for its generation. The conversion of VIII to IX can be performed in a solvent such as Et2O or THF at a temperature below 0° C. The reaction is normally smooth and completes over a period ranging from one to overnight standing at room temperature. The same reaction conditions can be used for the reaction of II with LG1-G-MgBr to give IX, or with III to give IV. Compounds of formula IV can be obtained reacting compound V with Ph-MgBr under same conditions for Grignard addition.
Compounds of formula VII, wherein LG1 is triflate can be obtained from a compound of formula IV. The deprotection step includes the hydrogenation for the removal of the benzyl group protecting the phenol and then hydrolysis of the ester to give compound of formula VI. The obtained carboxylic acid VI can be first reacted with R-O-L-R2, under ester formation reaction condition and then treated with a triflating agent, as described above for the preparation of compound of formula XXVII.
Compounds IV, VII and IX are all suitable intermediates for the preparation of single stereoisomers of compound of formula I. For example, the racemic mixtures or mixtures in any proportion of isomers of anyone of these three intermediates can be separated by mean of chiral chromatographic separation. In case, for example, R2 is enantiomerically pure J1, J2 or J5, a compound VII is a mixture of diastereoisomers that can be separated by mean of a normal chromatographic separation.
The absolute configuration of the stereogenic center present in VII is conserved unmodified within the synthetic pathway applied for the conversion of VII or IX into the final compound I.
Compounds of formula I wherein L is -(CH2)s-, s is 0 and R2 is J1, J2 or J5 contain three stereogenic centers, as indicated below (wherein e.g. J=J2) with the symbol *. Therefore the structure of formula I is characterized by different stereoisomers.
Each diastereoisomer can be obtained theoretically by chromatographic separation of the mixture obtained by reacting racemic mixtures of the required intermediates. It is clear that this approach it is not convenient and that it can be used only for the separation of mixtures containing few diastereoisomers.
In a more convenient approach, the synthesis of each single stereoisomer can be accomplished using, in the reactions described above, only enantiomerically pure intermediates.
The enantiomerically pure alcohol required for the preparation of compounds I wherein R2 is J1, J2, J5 or J6 are commercially available.
The preparation of single enantiomerically pure compounds XXII wherein LG is bromine are described in WO 2005/092861, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Biological Characterization
Example 17-M3 Receptor Radioligand Binding Assay
Human M3 receptor membranes (15 ug/well) from Perkin Elmer were incubated with 0.52 nM Scopolamine Methyl Chloride, [N-methyl-3H] with or without test compounds, or a saturating concentration of Atropine (5 μM) for the determination of non-specific binding. The assay was carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in a volume of 250 ul. The assay buffer used was 50 mM Tris-HCl, 154 mM NaCl (pH 7.4). The final assay concentration of DMSO was 0.5% (v/v). The plates were sealed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker (slow speed). Membranes were harvested onto 96-well unifilter GF/C filter plates pre-treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine (v/v), using a filter manifold, washed four times with 200 ul of assay buffer. The plates were dried before addition of 50 μl of microscint-0, sealed then read in a Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter. IC50 values are determined from competition curves using a non-linear curve fitting program. Ki values were calculated from IC50 values by the Cheng and Prusoff equation.
The M3 Ki values of the compounds according to the invention are less than 50 nM, most of them even less than 10 nM. The preferred compounds according to the invention have Ki value less than 4 nM or even less than 3 nM; for the enantiomeric mixture and/or at least for one of the enantiomeric pure form (S or R) on the stereogenic center (2).
Example 18-β2 Adrenoceptor Radioligand Binding Assay
Human β2 adrenoceptor membranes (7.5 ug/well) from Perkin Elmer were incubated with 0.3 nM 125-I Cyanopindolol with or without test compounds, or a saturating concentration of s-propranolol (2 μM) for the determination of non-specific binding. The assay was carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in a volume of 200 ul. The assay buffer used was 25 mM HEPES, 0.5% BSA (w/v), 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% ascorbic acid (v/v), (pH 7.4). The final assay concentration of DMSO was 0.5% (v/v). The plates were sealed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker (slow speed). Membranes were harvested onto 96-well unifilter GF/C filter plates pre-treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine (v/v), using a filter manifold, washed six times with 200 ul of wash buffer containing 10 mM HEPES and 500 mM NaCl. The plates were dried before addition of 50 μl of microscint-0, sealed then read in a Trilux Microbeta scintillation counter. IC50 values are determined from competition curves using a non-linear curve fitting program. Ki values were calculated from IC50 values by the Cheng and Prusoff equation.
The β2 Ki values of the compounds according to the invention are less than 50 nM, most of them even less than 10 nM.
