CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of the Invention
The present invention relates to an organic compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to an organic compound capable of reducing a driving voltage of an organic light emitting diode by an excellent charge transporting property, and the organic light emitting diode and the organic light emitting display device including the organic compound.
Discussion of the Related Art
As recent requirements of a flat panel display device having a small occupied area have increased, an organic light emitting display (OLED) device including an organic light emitting diode have been developed. The OLED device may be referred to as an organic electroluminescent device (OELD).
The organic light emitting diode emits light by injecting electrons from a cathode as an electron injection electrode and holes from an anode as a hole injection electrode into an emitting material layer (EML), combining the electrons with the holes, generating an exciton, and transforming the exciton from an excited state to a ground state. A flexible substrate, for example, a plastic substrate, can be used as a base substrate where elements are formed. The OLED device can be operated at a voltage (e.g., 10V or below) lower than a voltage required to operate other display devices. Moreover, the OLED device has an excellent color purity.
An organic emitting layer of the OLED device may have a single-layered structure of an emitting material layer (EML). Alternatively, to improve an emitting efficiency, the organic emitting layer may have a multi-layered structure. For example, the organic emitting layer may include a hole injection layer (HIL), a hole transporting layer (HTL), the EML, an electron transporting layer (ETL) and an electron injection layer (EIL).
To further improve the property or characteristic of the organic light emitting diode, a white emitting diode including at least two stacks is introduced. It may be referred to as a tandem structure organic light emitting diode. The tandem structure organic light emitting diode includes a charge generation layer (CGL) between adjacent stacks.
The organic materials used for the organic light emitting diode may be classified into an emitting material and a charge transporting material. In addition, the charge transporting material may be classified into a hole injection material, a hole transporting material, an electron transporting material and an electron injection material. Since high driving voltage and high current density in the organic light emitting diode may provide strong stress on the organic materials, there are bad effect on the stability and the lifetime.
The research for increasing the efficiency of the organic light emitting diode and reducing the power consumption of the organic light emitting diode by controlling an energy level of the charge transporting layer and/or the charge injection layer has been carried out. For example, Korean Patent Publication No. 2015-0026463 discloses the lifetime of the organic light emitting diode may be improved by using a charge transporting material having a vinyl end-group to decrease thermal degradation and prevent a pixel contraction.
However, a charge transporting material being capable of improving the current density, the lifetime and the emitting efficiency and decreasing the driving voltage and the stress to the organic light emitting diode is still required.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Accordingly, an embodiment of the present invention is directed to an organic compound, an organic light emitting diode and an organic light emitting display (OLED) device including the same that substantially obviates one or more of the problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.
An object of the present invention is to provide an organic compound having an excellent hole transporting property and a charge generation property.
Another object of the present invention is to provide an organic light emitting diode and an OLED device having advantages in the driving voltage and the lifetime.

Since the organic compound of the present invention has an excellent hole transporting property, when the organic compound is included in the organic layer of an organic light emitting diode, the hole transporting efficiency in the organic light emitting diode is improved such that there is an advantage in the driving voltage. In addition, since the balance of the hole and the electron in the organic light emitting diode is improved, the emitting efficiency is increased. Moreover, since the stress on the organic materials by high driving voltage is decreased, the life time and the emitting efficiency are improved.

FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view of an organic light emitting diode according to a first embodiment of the present invention.
As shown in FIG. 1, the organic light emitting diode 100 includes a first electrode 110, a second electrode 120, an emitting part 130 between the first and second electrodes 110 and 120.

A fluorescent dopant material, such as 4,4'-bis(9-ethyl-3-carbazovinylene)-1,1'-biphenyl (BCzVBi) or diphenyl-[4-(2-[1,1;4,1]terphenyl-4-yl-vinyl)-phenyl]-amine (BD-1) may be used.
The EML 170 in a green pixel may include a carbazole derivative compound as a phosphorescent host and a metal complex, e.g., dp2Ir(acac) or op2Ir(acac), as a phosphorescent dopant.

The ETL 180 is positioned between the EML 170 and the second electrode 120, and the EIL 190 is positioned between the ETL 180 and the second electrode 120. The ETL 180 may be formed of a derivative compound of oxadiazole, triazole, phenanthroline, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, benzimidazole or triazine. For example, the ETL 180 may be formed of an electron transporting material selected from the group consisting of tris-(8-hydroxyquinoline aluminum (Alq3), 2-biphenyl-4-yl-5-(4-t-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD), spiro-PBD, Liq, 2-[4-(9,10-Di-2-naphthalenyl-2-anthracenyl)phenyl]-1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol, 3-(biphenyl-4-yl)-5-(4-tertbutylphenyl)-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (Bphen), tris(phenylquinoxaline (TPQ) and 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimiazole-2-yl)benzene (TPBI), but it is not limited thereto.
Alternatively, the ETL 180 may include the above electron transporting material and a metal, e.g., alkali metal or alkali earth metal, as a dopant. In this instance, the dopant may have a weight % of about 1 to 20 with respect to the electron transporting material, but it is not limited thereto. For example, the dopant may be one of Li, Na, K, Cs, Mg, Sr, Ba and Ra, but it is not limited thereto. The ETL 180 may have a single-layered structure or a multi-layered structure.
The EIL 190 may include an alkali halide compound, e.g., LiF, CsF, NaF or BaF2, or an organo-metallic compound, e.g., lithium quinolate (Liq), lithium benzoate or sodium stearate, but it is not limited thereto.
The hole auxiliary layer 140 and the EBL 166 are positioned between the first electrode 110 and the EML 170. The hole auxiliary layer 140 may include the HIL 150 between the first electrode 110 and the EML 170 and the HTL 160 between the HIL 150 and the EML 170.
The interface property between the first electrode 110 of an inorganic material and the HTL 160 of an organic material is improved by the HIL 150. For example, the HIL 150 may be formed of a hole injection material such as 4,4',4″-tris(3-methylphenylphenylamino)triphenylamine (MTDATA), copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), Tris(4-carbazoyl-9-yl-phenyl)amine (TCTA), N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(1-naphthyl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4 ″-diamine (NPB or NPD), 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylenehexacarbonitrile (HATCN), 1,3,5-tris[4-(diphenylamino)phenyl]benzene (TDAPB), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT/PSS), 2,3,5, 6-tetrafluoro-7,7, 8, 8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4TCNQ) or N-(biphenyl-4-yl)-9,9-dimethyl-N-(4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine.
Alternatively, the organic compound of the present invention may be doped into the hole injection material to form the HIL 150. In this instance, the organic compound of the present invention may have a weight % of about 0.1 to 50, but it is not limited thereto.
The HIL 150 may have a double-layered structure. In this instance, a lower layer (first HIL) of the HIL 150, which is closer to the first electrode 110 than the an upper layer (second HIL) of the HIL 150, may include the hole injection material without the organic compound of the present invention, and the upper layer of the HIL 150, which is positioned between the lower layer and the HTL 160, may include the hole injection material with the organic compound of the present invention.
The HTL 160 is positioned between the HIL 150 and the EML 170 to be adjacent to the EML 170. The HTL 160 may include only the organic compound of the present invention or may include the organic compound and a hole transporting dopant. For example, the hole transporting dopant may be one of N,N'-diphenyl-N,N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4,4'-diamine (TPD), NPD and 4,4'-bis(N-carbazolyl)-1,1'-biphenyl (CBP). The hole transporting dopant may have a weight % of about 0.1 to 50, but it is not limited thereto.
When the hole is migrated toward the second electrode 120 or the electron is migrated toward the first electrode 110 beyond the EML 170, the lifetime and the emitting efficiency of the organic light emitting diode may be decreased. To prevent this problem, the organic light emitting diode in an embodiment of the present invention may include an exciton blocking layer at an upper side or a lower side of the EML 170.
For example, the EBL 166 is formed between the hole auxiliary layer 140 and the EML 170 to block the migration of the electron. The EBL 166 may include the organic compound in an embodiment of the present invention.
Although not shown, a hole blocking layer may be formed between the EML 170 and the ETL 180 to block the migration of the hole. For example, the hole blocking layer may include a material of the ETL 180, such as a derivative of oxadiazole, triazole, phenanthroline, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, benzimidazole or triazine. The hole blocking layer may include a material having a relatively low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), such as 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP) or bis(2-methyl-8-quinolinolato)(4-phenylphenolato)aluminum (III) (BAlq).
The organic light emitting diode 100 according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes the first electrode 110 and the second electrode 120, the emitting part 130 including the EML 170, the hole auxiliary layer 140, optionally the EBL 166, and at least one of the hole auxiliary layer 140 and the EBL 166 includes the organic compound of the present invention.
Since the organic compound of the present invention has an excellent hole transporting property, the organic compound singly or in combination with a dopant is used for the hole auxiliary layer 140 and/or the EBL 166 such that the driving voltage and the power consumption of the organic light emitting diode 100 is reduced and the lifetime and the emitting efficiency of the organic light emitting diode 100 is improved.

As shown in FIG. 2, the organic light emitting diode 200 includes a first electrode 210, a second electrode 220, an emitting part 230 between the first electrode 210 and the second electrode 220. The emitting part 230 includes a hole auxiliary layer 240, an EBL 266, an EML 270, an ETL 280 and an EIL 290. The hole auxiliary layer 240 and the EBL 266 are positioned between the first electrode 210 and the EML 270, and the ETL 280 and the EIL 290 are positioned between the EML 270 and the second electrode 220. The hole auxiliary layer 240 includes an HIL 250 and an HTL 260 including a first HTL 262 and a second HTL 264.
As mentioned above, the first electrode 210 as an anode includes a high work function conductive material, and the second electrode 220 as a cathode includes a low work function conductive material. The EML 270 may include a host and a dopant. The ETL 280 may include a derivative compound of oxadiazole, triazole, phenanthroline, benzoxazole, benzothiazole, benzimidazole or triazine. The ETL 280 may further include alkali metal or alkali earth metal as a dopant. The EIL 290 between the ETL 280 and the second electrode 220 may include an alkali halide compound, e.g., LiF, CsF, NaF or BaF2, or an organo-metallic compound, e.g., lithium quinolate (Liq), lithium benzoate or sodium stearate.
The interface property between the first electrode 210 of an inorganic material and the HTL 260 of an organic material is improved by the HIL 250. For example, the HIL 250 may be formed of a hole injection material such as MTDATA, CuPc, TCTA, NPB (NPD), HATCN, TDAPB, PEDOT/PSS, F4TCNQ or N-(biphenyl-4-yl)-9,9-dimethyl-N-(4-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)phenyl)-9H-fluoren-2-amine. Alternatively, the organic compound of the present invention may be doped into the hole injection material to form the HIL 250.

The driving TFT Td includes a semiconductor layer 940, a gate electrode 944, a source electrode 956 and a drain electrode 958. The driving TFT Td in FIG. 9 has a coplanar structure.
A first substrate 901 and a second substrate 902 facing the first substrate 901 are attached to form a display panel. Each of the first substrate 901 and the second substrate 902 may be a glass substrate, a thin flexible substrate or a polymer plastic substrate. The first substrate 901, on which the driving TFT Td and the organic light emitting diode E are formed, may be referred to as an array substrate. The organic light emitting diode E is encapsuled by the second substrate 902 which may be referred to as an encapsulation substrate. For example, the first substrate 901 and the second substrate 902 may be attached to each other by an adhesive layer 980.
The semiconductor layer 940 is formed on the first substrate 901. The semiconductor layer 940 may be formed of an oxide semiconductor material. When the semiconductor layer 940 includes the oxide semiconductor material, a light-shielding pattern (not shown) may be formed under the semiconductor layer 940. The light to the semiconductor layer 940 is shielded or blocked by the light-shielding pattern such that thermal degradation of the semiconductor layer 940 can be prevented. On the other hand, when the semiconductor layer 940 includes polycrystalline silicon, impurities may be doped into both sides of the semiconductor layer 940.
A gate insulating layer 942 is formed on the semiconductor layer 940 and over an entire surface of the first substrate 901. The gate insulating layer 942 may be formed of an inorganic insulating material such as silicon oxide or silicon nitride.

In FIG. 9, the first semiconductor contact hole 952 and the second semiconductor 954 are formed through the gate insulating layer 942 as well as the interlayer insulating layer 950. Alternatively, when the gate insulating layer 942 has the same shape as the gate electrode 944, the first semiconductor contact hole 952 and the second semiconductor contact hole 954 may be formed in the interlayer insulating layer 950 except the gate insulating layer 942.
The source electrode 956 and the drain electrode 958, which are formed of a conductive material, e.g., metal, are formed on the interlayer insulating layer 950. In addition, a data line (not shown) extending along a second direction, a power line (not shown) and a second capacitor electrode (not shown) may be formed on the interlayer insulating layer 950. The data line crosses the gate line to define a pixel region, and the power line is spaced apart from and parallel to the data line. The second capacitor electrode is connected to the drain electrode 958 and overlaps the first capacitor electrode to form a storage capacitor with the interlayer insulating layer 950.
The source electrode 956 and the drain electrode 958 are spaced apart from each other with respect to the gate electrode 944 and respectively contact both sides of the semiconductor layer 940 through the first and second semiconductor contact holes 952 and 954.
In the driving TFT Td, the gate electrode 944, the source electrode 956 and the drain electrode 958 are positioned over the semiconductor layer 940. Namely, the driving TFT Td has a coplanar structure.
Alternatively, in the driving TFT Td, the gate electrode may be positioned under the semiconductor layer, and the source and drain electrodes may be positioned over the semiconductor layer such that the driving TFT Td may have an inverted staggered structure. In this instance, the semiconductor layer may include amorphous silicon.
A switching TFT (not shown) is formed on the first substrate 901. The switching TFT may have substantially the same structure as the driving TFT Td. The gate electrode 944 is connected to a drain electrode of the switching TFT, and the source electrode 956 is connected to the power line. A gate electrode and a source electrode of the switching TFT are connected to the gate line and the data line, respectively.
A planarization layer 960, which provides a flat top surface and includes a drain contact hole 962 exposing the drain electrode 958 of the driving TFT Td, is formed to cover the driving TFT Td. The drain contact hole 962 may be spaced apart from the second semiconductor contact hole 954 in a plane.
The organic light emitting diode E is disposed on the planarization layer 960 and includes a first electrode 910, an organic emitting layer 920 and a second electrode 930. The first electrode 910 is connected to the drain electrode 958 of the driving TFT Td, and the organic emitting layer 920 and the second electrode 930 are sequentially stacked on the first electrode 910. A bank 972 as a pixel definition layer is formed to cover an edge of the first electrode 910.
As mentioned above, the first electrode 910 as an anode includes a high work function conductive material, and the second electrode 930 as a cathode includes a low work function conductive material.
The second substrate 902 is attached to the first substrate 901 using the adhesive layer 980. Although not shown, a barrier layer for preventing the moisture and/or oxygen penetration into the organic light emitting diode E may be formed between the second substrate 902 and the organic light emitting diode E to cover the organic light emitting diode E.
As explained through FIGS. 1 to 8, the organic emitting layer 920 may include an HIL, an HTL, an EBL and a CGL with an EML, and at least of the HIL, the HTL, the EBL and the CGL includes the organic compound of the present invention. When the organic light emitting diode E has the tandem structure as those in FIGS. 5 to 8 as a white OLED, a color filter (not shown) may be formed under or over the organic light emitting diode E to provide a full-color image.
As mentioned above, the organic compound of the present invention has excellent hole transporting property. Accordingly, the organic compound of the present invention is used for the hole auxiliary layer (e.g., the HIL and/or the HTL) and the EBL. In this instance, the hole injection material or the hole transporting material may be doped into the organic compound such that the hole transporting property is further improved. In addition, in the tandem structure organic light emitting diode emitting the white light, the organic compound singly or in combination with the dopant is used for the P-CGL to provide the charge into adjacent emitting part. As a result, the driving voltage and the power consumption of the organic light emitting diode is reduced and the lifetime and the emitting efficiency of the organic light emitting diode is improved.
