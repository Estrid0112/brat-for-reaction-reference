TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to novel tetrahydropyridine derivatives that are useful for the treatment of bacterial infection, especially Gram-negative infections. The present disclosure also relates to methods of using such compounds in the treatment of bacterial infections in mammals, to use thereof for the preparation of medicaments for treating bacterial infections, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.
BACKGROUND ART
Infection by Gram-negative bacteria such as Extended Spectrum β-lactamase producing (ESBL) Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii is a major health problem, especially in the case of hospital-acquired infections. In addition, there is an increasing level of resistance to current antibiotic therapies, which severely limits treatment options.
Gram-negative bacteria are unique in that their outer membrane contains lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is crucial for maintaining membrane integrity, and is essential for bacterial viability (Rev. Biochem 76: 295-329, 2007). The major lipid component of LPS is Lipid A and inhibition of Lipid A biosynthesis is lethal to bacteria. Lipid A synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the bacterial inner membrane via a pathway that consists of nine different enzymes. These enzymes are highly conserved in most Gram-negative bacteria. LpxC is the enzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in the Lipid A biosynthetic pathway, the removal of the N-acetyl group of UDP-3-O-(R-3-hydroxymyristoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine. LpxC is a Zn2+ dependent enzyme that has no mammalian homologue, making it a good target for the development of novel antibiotics.

The compounds of formula I according to the present disclosure or the stereoisomers, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, may therefore be used for the prevention or treatment of bacterial infection selected from nosocomial pneumonia, urinary tract infections, systemic infections (such as bacteraemia and sepsis), skin and soft tissue infections, surgical infections, intraabdominal infections, lung infections (including those in patients with cystic fibrosis), endocarditis, diabetic foot infection, osteomyelitis, and central nervous system infections.
The compounds of formula I according to the present disclosure or the stereoisomers display intrinsic antibacterial properties and have the ability to improve permeability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria to other antibacterial agents. Their use in combination with another antibacterial agent might offer some further advantages such as lowered side-effects of drugs due to lower doses used or shorter time of treatment, more rapid cure of infection shortening hospital stays, increasing spectrum of pathogens controlled, and decreasing incidence of development of resistance to antibiotics. The antibacterial agent for use in combination with a compound of formula I according to the present disclosure will be selected from the group consisting a penicillin antibiotic (such as ampicillin, piperacillin, penicillin G, amoxicillin, or tetracillin), a cephalosporin antibiotic (such as ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, cefotaxime), a carbapenem antibiotic (such as imipenem, or meropenem), a monobactam antibiotic (such as aztreonam), a fluoroquinolone antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin or levofloxacin), a macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin or azithromycin), an aminoglycoside antibiotic (such as amikacin, gentamycin or tobramycin), a glycopeptide antibiotic (such as vancomycin or teicoplanin), a tetracycline antibiotics (such as tetracycline), and linezolid, clindamycin, telavancin, daptomycin, novobiocin, rifampicin and polymyxin.
In order to exhibit this antibacterial activity, the compounds need to be administered in a therapeutically effective amount. A “therapeutically effective amount” is meant to describe a sufficient quantity of the compound to treat the infection, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any such medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the attending physician, within the scope of sound medical judgment, will decide the total daily dosage of the compound. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorders; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts. As a general guideline however, the total daily dose will typically range from about 0.1 mg/kg/day to about 5,000 mg/kg/day in single or in divided doses. Typically, dosages for humans will range from about 10 mg to about 3,000 mg per day, in a single or multiple doses.
Any route typically used to treat infectious illness, including oral, parenteral, topical, rectal, transmucosal, and intestinal, can be used to administer the compounds. Parenteral administrations include injections to generate a systemic effect or injections directly into the afflicted area. Examples of parenteral administrations are subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intradermal, intrathecal, and intraocular, intranasal, intraventricular injections or infusions techniques. Topical administrations include the treatment of areas readily accessible by local application, such as, for example, eyes, ears including external and middle ear infections, vaginal, open wound, skin including the surface skin and the underneath dermal structures, or other lower intestinal tract. Transmucosal administration includes nasal aerosol or inhalation applications.
