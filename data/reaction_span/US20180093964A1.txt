BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The immune system has evolved to recognize and neutralize different types of threats in order to maintain the homeostasis of the host, and it is generally broken down into two arms: adaptive and innate. The adaptive immune system is specialized to recognize as foreign those antigens not naturally expressed in the host and to mount an anti-antigen response through the coordinated actions of many leukocyte subsets. The hallmark of adaptive immune responses is their ability to provide “memory” or long-lasting immunity against the encountered antigen. While this specific and long-lasting effect is critical to host health and survival, the adaptive immune response requires time to generate a full-blown response.
The innate immune system compensates for this time delay and is specialized to act quickly against different insults or danger signals. It provides the first line of defense against bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infectious threats, but it also responds strongly to certain danger signals associated with cellular or tissue damage. The innate immune system has no antigen specificity but does respond to a variety of effector mechanisms. Opsonization, phagocytosis, activation of the complement system, and production of soluble bioactive molecules such as cytokines or chemokines are all mechanisms by Which the innate immune system mediates its response. By responding to these damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAWN) described above, the innate immune system is able to provide broad protection against a wide range of threats to the host.
Free cytosolic DNA and RNA are among these PAMPs and DAMPs. It has recently been demonstrated that the main sensor for cytosolic DNA is cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase). Upon recognition of cytosolic DNA, cGAS catalyzes the generation of the cyclic-dinucleotide 2'3'-cGAMP, an atypical second messenger that strongly binds to the ER-transmembrane adaptor protein STING. A conformational change is undergone by cGAMP-bound STING, which translocates to a perinuclear compartment and induces the activation of critical transcription factors IRF-3 and NF-κB. This leads to a strong induction of type I interferons and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α and IFN-γ.
The importance of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines on various cells of the immune system has been very well established. In particular, these molecules strongly potentiate T-cell activation by enhancing the ability of dendritic cells and macrophages to uptake, process, present and cross-present antigens to T-cells. The T-cell stimulatory capacity of these antigen-presenting cells is augmented by the up-regulation of critical co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80 or CD86. Finally, type I interferons can rapidly engage their cognate receptors and trigger the activation of interferon-responsive genes that can significantly contribute to adaptive immune cell activation.
From a therapeutic perspective, type I interferons are shown to have antiviral activities by directly inhibiting human hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication, and by stimulating immune responses to virally infected cells. Compounds that can induce type I interferon production are used in vaccines, where they act as adjuvants, enhancing specific immune responses to antigens and minimizing side effects by reducing dosage and broadening the immune response.
In addition, interferons, and compounds that can induce interferon production, have potential use in the treatment of human cancers. Such molecules are potentially useful as anti-cancer agents with multiple pathways of activity. Interferons can inhibit human tumor cell proliferation directly and may be synergistic with various approved chemotherapeutic agents. Type I interferons can significantly enhance anti-tumor immune responses by inducing activation of both the adaptive and innate immune cells. Finally, tumor invasiveness may be inhibited by interferons by modulating enzyme expression related to tissue remodeling.
In view of the potential of type I interferons and type I interferon-inducing compounds as anti-viral and anti-cancer agents, there remains a need for new agents that can induce potent type I interferon production. With the growing body of data demonstrating that the cGAS-STING cytosolic DNA sensory pathway has a significant capacity to induce type I interferons, the development of STING activating agents is rapidly taking an important place in today's anti-tumor therapy landscape.

In the compounds of general formula (Ia), the compounds of general formula (Ia'), the compounds of general formula (Ib), the compounds of general formula (Ib'), the compounds of general formula (I), the compounds of general formula (I'), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the foregoing, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present disclosure is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of general formula (Ia), the compounds of general formula (Ia'), the compounds of general formula (Ib), the compounds of general formula (Ib'), the compounds of general formula (I), the compounds of general formula (I'), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the foregoing. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H), deuterium (2H), and tritium (3H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched the compounds of general formula (Ia), the compounds of general formula (Ia'), the compounds of general formula (Ib), the compounds of general formula (Ib'), the compounds of general formula (I), the compounds of general formula (I'), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the foregoing, can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates.
In particular embodiments of the compounds of general formula (Ia), the compounds of general formula (Ia'), the compounds of general formula (Ib), the compounds of general formula (Ib'), the compounds of general formula (I), the compounds of general formula (I'), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the foregoing, the compounds are isotopically enriched with deuterium.

As shown in the general structural formulas and the structures of specific compounds as provided herein, a straight line at a chiral center includes both (R) and (S) stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Also, unless otherwise specified (e.g., 100% purified compound), reference to a particular stereochemistry at a position provides a compound having the indicated stereochemistry but does not exclude the presence of stereoisomers having different stereochemistry at the indicated position.
Recitation or depiction of a specific compound in the claims (i.e., a species) without a specific stereoconfiguration designation, or with such a designation for less than all chiral centers, is intended to encompass, for such undesignated chiral centers, the racemate, racemic mixtures, each individual enantiomer, a diastereoisomeric mixture and each individual diastereomer of the compound where such forms are possible due to the presence of one or more asymmetric centers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of general formula (Ia), a compound of general formula (Ia'), a compound of general formula (Ib), a compound of general formula (Ib'), a compound of general formula (I), a compound of general formula (I'), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates, which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Alternatively, absolute stereochemistry may be determined by Vibrational Circular Dichroism (VCD) spectroscopy analysis. The present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (including hydrates), and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, and mixtures thereof.
The invention includes all possible enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of two or more stereoisomers, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. Thus, enantiomers are a subject of the invention in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and as dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. In the case of a cis/trans isomerism, the invention includes both the cis form and the trans form, as well as mixtures of these forms in all ratios. The preparation of individual stereoisomers can be carried out, if desired, by separation of a mixture by customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, by the use of stereochemically uniform starting materials for the synthesis or by stereoselective synthesis. Optionally a derivatization can be carried out before a separation of stereoisomers. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at an intermediate step during the synthesis of a compound of general formula (Ia), a compound of general formula (Ia'), a compound of general formula (Ib), a compound of general formula (Ib'), a compound of general formula (I), a compound of general formula (I'), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, or it can be done on a final racemic product. Absolute stereochemistry may be determined by X-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates that are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing a stereogenic center of known configuration. Unless a particular isomer, salt, solvate (including hydrates) or solvated salt of such racemate, enantiomer, or diastereomer is indicated, the present invention includes all such isomers, as well as salts, solvates (including hydrates), and solvated salts of such racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers, and mixtures thereof.
The term “compound” refers to the compound and, in certain embodiments, to the extent they are stable, any hydrate or solvate thereof. A hydrate is the compound complexed with water, and a solvate is the compound complexed with a solvent, which may be an organic solvent or an inorganic solvent.
A “stable” compound is a compound that can be prepared and isolated and whose structure and properties remain or can be caused to remain essentially unchanged for a period of time sufficient to allow use of the compound for the purposes described herein (e.g., therapeutic administration to a subject). The compounds of the present invention are limited to stable compounds embraced by general formula (Ia), general formula (Ia'), general formula (Ib), general formula (Ib'), general formula (I), and general formula (I'), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.
Salts
As indicated above, the compounds of the present invention can be employed in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Those skilled in the art will recognize those instances in which the compounds of the invention may form salts. Examples of such compounds are described herein by reference to possible salts. Such reference is for illustration only. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used with compounds for treating patients. Non-pharmaceutical salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of intermediate compounds.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt (including an inner salt such as a zwitterion) that possesses effectiveness similar to the parent compound and that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable (e.g., is neither toxic nor otherwise deleterious to the recipient thereof). Thus, an embodiment of the invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention. The term “salt(s)”, as employed herein, denotes any of the following: acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic bases. Salts of compounds of the invention may be formed by methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art, for example, by reacting a compound of the invention with an amount of acid or base, such as an equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the salt precipitates or in aqueous medium followed by lyophilization.
Exemplary acid addition salts include acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisulfates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsulfonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates (“mesylates”), naphthalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propionates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocyanates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates) and the like. Suitable salts include acid addition salts that may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of a compound with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, or benzoic acid. Additionally, acids that are generally considered suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically useful salts from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for example, by P. Stahl et al, Camille G. (eds.), Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts. Properties, Selection and Use. (2002) Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; P. Gould, International J. of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press, New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Administration, Washington, D.C. on their website). These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.
Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic amines) such as dicyclohexylamine, t-butyl amine, choline, and salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like. Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quarternized with agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g., methyl, ethyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g., dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides (e.g., decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), aralkyl halides (e.g., benzyl and phenethyl bromides), and others. Compounds carrying an acidic moiety can be mixed with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts to provide, for example, alkali metal salts (e.g., sodium or potassium salts), alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., calcium or magnesium salts), and salts formed with suitable organic ligands such as quaternary ammonium salts. Also, in the case of an acid (-COOH) or alcohol group being present, pharmaceutically acceptable esters can be employed to modify the solubility or hydrolysis characteristics of the compound.
All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the invention and all acid and base salts are considered equivalent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for purposes of the invention.
In addition, when a compound of the invention contains both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to an aliphatic primary, secondary, tertiary or cyclic amine, an aromatic or heteroaryl amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not limited to tetrazole or carboxylic acid, zwitterions (“inner salts”) may be formed and are included within the terms “salt(s)” as used herein. It is understood that certain compounds of the invention may exist in zwitterionic form, having both anionic and cationic centers within the same compound and a net neutral charge. Such zwitterions are included within the invention.

Method 1
Benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acids b, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are typically prepared from ortho-halo benzaldehydes. The sequence starts with treatment with an alpha-thio acetic acid ester under basic conditions. The ester in the resulting compound was cleaved to the carboxylic acid under basic conditions to provide the desired substituted benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acid 1C.

Method 2
Another method for the preparation of benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acids, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is detailed in Scheme 2. The sequence starts with a benzo[b]thiophene substituted at the 2-position with an appropriate 1,3-dicarbonyl group, such as a beta-keto ester. It was reacted with an alpha-halo ester under basic conditions to afford substitution at the 2 position of the alkyl chain. Then, both esters were hydrolyzed using either acidic or basic conditions; upon further exposure to basic conditions, the carboxylic acid corresponding to the ester in the starting material underwent decarboxylation to give the desired benzo[b]thiophene keto acid 2C.

Method 3
Another method for the preparation of benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acids, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is detailed in Scheme 3. The sequence starts with a benzo[b]thiophene without substitution at the 2 position. It was treated with tert-butyllithium followed by a cyclic acid anhydride to give the desired 4-keto carboxylic acid product 3B.

Method 4
Another method for the preparation of benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acids, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is detailed in Scheme 4. The sequence starts with a benzo[b]thiophene substituted with a carboxylic acid at the 2 position. It was treated with oxalyl chloride/dichloromethane. The resulting acid chloride was reacted with an alkyl zinc reagent, typically containing an ester, using a transition metal such as copper or palladium to mediate the coupling. Then, the ester was cleaved under basic or acidic conditions to provide the desired benzo[b]thiophene gamma-keto acid 4D.

Method 5
Another method for the preparation of benzo[b]thiophene 2-carboxylic acids, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, is detailed in Scheme 5. The sequence starts with a benzo[b]thiophene substituted at the 2 position with a gamma-keto ester and with a halide or triflate on the benzo[b]thiophene. It was treated with a boronic ester, acid, or trifluoroborate salt and a palladium catalyst under aqueous basic conditions. Then the ester in the resulting compound was cleaved to the carboxylic acid under basic conditions to provide the desired substituted benzo[b]thiophene 5C.

Activity: STING Biochemical [3H]cGAMP Competition Assay
The individual compounds described in the Examples herein are defined as STING agonists by (i) binding to the STING protein as evidenced by a reduction in binding of tritiated cGAMP ligand to the STING protein by at least 20% at 20 uM (concentration of compound being tested) in a STING Biochemical [3H]cGAMP Competition Assay and (ii) demonstrating interferon production with a 6% or greater induction of IFN-β secretion at 30 uM in the THP1 cell assay (where induction caused by cGAMP at 30 uM was set at 100%).
The ability of compounds to bind STING is quantified by the ability to compete with tritiated cGAMP ligand for human STING receptor membrane using a radioactive filter-binding assay. The binding assay employs STING receptor obtained from Hi-Five cell membranes overexpressing full-length HAQ STING prepared in-house and tritiated cGAMP ligand also purified in-house.
The following experimental procedures detail the preparation of specific examples of the instant disclosure. The compounds of the examples are drawn in their neutral forms in the procedures and tables below. In some cases, the compounds were isolated as salts depending on the method used for their final purification and/or intrinsic molecular properties. The examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the instant disclosure in any way.

Biological Evaluation
The individual compounds described in the Examples herein are defined as STING agonists by (i) binding to the STING protein as evidenced by a reduction in binding of tritiated cGAMP ligand to the STING protein by at least 20% at 20 uM (concentration of compound being tested) in a STING Biochemical [3H]cGAMP Competition Assay and (ii) demonstrating interferon production with a 6% or greater induction of IFN-β secretion at 30 uM in the THP1 cell assay (where induction caused by cGAMP at 30 uM was set at 100%).
[3H]-cGAMP Synthesis
2.3 mL of buffer solution containing 80 mM TrisCl, 200 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM NaCl followed by 0.32 mL of a 10 mM aq solution of GTP was added to a plastic 50 mL AMICON tube. A solution of [3H]ATP (21Ci/mmol, 45 mCi) in 0.5 mL H2O was then added followed by 1 mL of a 1 mg/mL solution of DNA (Herring testes activator DNA, Sigma, #D6898) and 53 uL of a 47 mM solution of cGAS enzyme. Additional H2O was added to bring the total volume to 10 mL.
The reaction was stirred for 2 h at 37° C. and then added directly to an Amicon Ultra-15 10K centrifuge tube and spun for 1 h at 4,000 g. The collected solution was then purified on a semi-prep Mono Q column using the following mobile phases:A: 0.05M TrisCl pH 8.5 adjusted with 1M NaOHB: 0.05M TrisCl, 0.5M NaCl pH 8.5 adjusted with 1M NaOH
Gradient: 100% A for 5 min followed by a linear gradient to 50:50 (A:B) over 25 min, 3 mL/min, 254 nm.
The collected product fractions were pooled and adjusted to a total volume of 30 mL with buffer A. A total yield of 15.5 mCi of [3H]cGAMP was isolated at a radiochemical purity of 98.0% at a specific activity of 21.5Ci/mmol.
cGAS Enzyme
A recombinant DNA vector was chemically synthesized to express the truncated human cGAS enzyme (residues 161-522). To aid in expression and purification, the amino terminus contains a hexahistidine tag, SUMO tag and TEV cleavage site. The recombinant enzyme was overexpressed in ROSETTA™ 2 (DE3) Single Competent Cells (Novagen). Affinity purification was carried out using HIS-Select HF Nickel Affinity Gel (Sigma) followed by size exclusion chromatography using a Hi-Load 26/60 SUPERDEX200 prep grade column (GE Healthcare). Fractions were pooled, concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80° C. until needed.
Example 55: 3H-cGAMP Filtration Binding Assay (HAQ STING)
The ability of compounds to bind STING is quantified by their ability to compete with tritiated cGAMP ligand for human STING receptor membrane using a radioactive filter-binding assay. The binding assay employs STING receptor obtained from Trichoplusia ni cell membranes (T. ni; Expression Systems, cat #94-002F, www.expressionsystems.com) overexpressing full-length HAQ STING and tritiated cGAMP ligand.
The basic HAQ STING filtration assay protocol is as follows:
The compounds were serially titrated by the Hamilton STARPlus CORE in a 96-well plate (Greiner, #651201) using a 1:3 ten-point dose response format. After compound preparation, a 2.2 ug/ml working concentration of STING membrane (SEQ. ID. No. 1) was prepared by diluting concentrated membrane into assay buffer (lx PBS; Invitrogen # SH30028.02) and douncing 7× using a manual tissue homogenizer (Wheaton, #357546). 148 uL of prepared membrane was then manually added to each well of a 96-well deep-well polypropylene plate (Fisher Scientific, #12-566-121). Following membrane addition, 2 uL of either titrated test compound, DMSO control (Sigma #276855), or cold cGAMP control was added to the appropriate wells using a BIOMEK FX. Compound and membrane then preincubated for 60 min at RT to allow compound binding to equilibrate. Following equilibration, 8 nM of [3H] c-GAMP ligand was prepared by diluting into assay buffer, and 50 uL of this working stock was then manually added to each well of the assay plate. Plates were then incubated at RT for 60 min, and the contents of each assay plate were then filtered through a 96-well GF/B filter plate (PerkinElmer, #6005250) using a TOMTEC MACH III Cell Harvester equipped with 20 mM HEPES buffer (Fisher Scientific, # BP299500). The filter plates were then dried at 55° C. for 30 min using a pressurized oven before 30 uL of ULTIMA GOLD F scintillate was added to each well. Tritium levels for each reaction well were then measured using a PerkinElmer TopCount plate reader.
After normalization to controls, the percent activity for each compound concentration was calculated by measuring the amount of remaining radioactivity. The plot of percent activity versus the log of compound concentration was fit with a 4-parameter dose response equation to calculate EC50 values.

Full-Length STING (HAQ) Virus Generation
STING virus was generated using an insect cell baculovirus system. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells (Kempbio, Inc.) were diluted to 5e5 cells/ml in Sf-900II SFM media (LifeTechnologies #10902088) without antibiotics. The cell suspension was added to each well of a treated 6-well plate (2 mL per well, 1e6 cells total), and the cells were allowed to adhere for at least 30 min. Meanwhile, a 1 mL co-transfection mix was assembled by combining 500 ng of HAQ STING [STING(1-379)R71H,G230A,H232R,R293Q-GG-AviTag-GS-HRV3C-HIS8/pBAC1] DNA (Genewiz custom synthesis) with 1 mL Sf-900II SFM media containing 10 μL Cellfectin® II Reagent (Invitrogen #10362100) and 100 ng viral backbone BestBac 2.0, v-cath/chiA Deleted Linearized Baculovirus DNA (Expression Systems #91-002). The transfection mixtures were allowed to incubate for 30 min. After incubation, media was gently removed from the adhered cells in the 6-well plate, the 1 mL transfection mixtures were added (1 mL per well), and the plate was placed in a humidified incubator at 27° C. The following day, 1 mL Sf-900II SFM media (no antibiotics) was added to each well of the 6-well plate. After media addition, the cells were allowed to incubate with DNA (SEQ. ID. No. 2) at 27° C. for 5-7 days to generate the P0 viral stock. To generate P1 viral stocks, 0.5 mL of P0 viral supernatant was added to 50 mL uninfected Sf21 cells (seeded the day prior to infection at a density of 5×105 cells/mL to allow for one overnight doubling) in Sf-900II SFM media containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin (Invitrogen #15710072). The infected cells were then incubated at 27° C. for 3 days while shaking at 110 rpm (ATR Biotech Multitron Infors HT #AJ118). On day 3, P1 cultures were counted using a ViCell XR (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences #383556) to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 85-95%). Cultures were harvested in 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The P1 viral supernatants were poured off into clean 50 ml centrifuge tubes, and the remaining P1 cell pellets were used to generate Baculovirus Infected Insect Cells (BIICs). Cryopreservation media containing Sf-900II SFM media with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 10% DMSO (Sigma #D2650), and 5 μg/ml gentamicin was prepared and sterilized through 0.22 μM filter immediately prior to use. P1 cell pellets were resuspended to a density of 2e7 cells/ml and aliquoted into cryovials (1 mL per vial). Cryovials were placed in MR. FROSTY™ cell freezers O/N at −80° C. and transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage the following day. To generate P2 viral stock, 0.5 mL of the P1 viral supernatant was added to 50 mL uninfected Sf21 cells (seeded the day prior to infection at a density of 5×105 cells/mL to allow for one overnight doubling) in Sf-900II SFM media containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin. These cells were incubated at 27° C. for 3 days while shaking at 110 rpm before harvesting P2 stock with centrifugation at 2000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The P2 viral supernatants were poured off and discarded, while the P2 cell pellets were used to generate P2 BIICs following the same protocol described above. The baculovirus generation protocol has been validated to consistently produce P1/P2 BIICs with titers of 2e9 pfu/mL (2e7 cells/mL×100 pfu/cell).
Full-Length STING (HAQ) Expression
To generate STING membranes, P1/P2 BIICs were amplified overnight by adding thawed BIICs to Sf21 cells seeded at a density of 1.0×106 cells/mL. The volume of BIIC used to infect the culture was calculated using an assumed BIIC titer of 2e9 pfu/ml to achieve an MOI of 10 in the overnight amplification. After culturing overnight, the cells were counted on a ViCell XR to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 80-90%). The volume of infected Sf21 cells from the overnight amplification used to infect the large-scale expression of Trichoplusia ni (T. ni; Expression Systems, cat #94-002F, www.expressionsystems.com) seeded at a density of 1.0×106 in cell media (ESF921 SFM containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin) at MOI=2.0 was calculated based on (100 pfu/infected Sf21 cell). The cells were allowed to express for 48 h at 27° C. before harvesting the cell pellet, by centrifugation at 3,400×g for 10 min at 4° C. T. ni cells were counted on a ViCell XR to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 80-90%) prior to harvest.

Lysis buffer [25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, (Benzonase 1:5000, Complete Protease Inhibitor tab/50 mL)] was added to the pellet of cells expressing full-length STING (HAQ) prepared above at 5 mL Lysis buffer per g of cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended and dounced twenty times using a Wheaton Dounce Homogenizer to disrupt the cell membrane. Homogenized lysate was then passed through the EMULSIFLEX-C5 microfluidizer at a pressure close to 5000 PSI. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 36,000 rpm (100,000×g) in a 45Ti rotor ultra-high speed centrifuge for 45 min, 4° C. The supernatant was removed. The pellet then was resuspended in wash buffer [(25 mM HEPES pH7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 1M NaCl (Complete Protease Inhibitor tab/50 mL)] at a volume of 50 mL pellet/centrifuge tube. The pellet/wash buffer mixture was then homogenized, using a glass homogenizer on ice (20 strokes), followed by centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 45 min at 4° C. The supernatant was removed. The wash step was repeated once more. The resulting membrane was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors (1 tablet/50 mL). The protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay, Cat#500-0006), and protein enrichment was determined by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by Western blot. The resuspended membranes were stored at −80° C.

Example 56: 3H-cGAMP Filtration Binding Assay (WT STING)
The ability of compounds to bind STING is quantified by their ability to compete with tritiated cGAMP ligand for human STING receptor membrane using a radioactive filter-binding assay. The binding assay employs STING receptor obtained from Trichoplusia ni cell membranes (T. ni; Expression Systems, cat #94-002F, www.expressionsystems.com) overexpressing full-length WT STING and tritiated cGAMP ligand.
The basic WT STING filtration assay protocol is as follows:
16 nM of [3H] c-GAMP ligand was prepared by diluting into assay buffer, and 50 uL of this working stock was manually added to each well of the assay plate. After ligand addition, 2 uL of either titrated test compound, DMSO control (Sigma #276855), or cold cGAMP control was added to the appropriate wells using a BIOMEK FX. The serially titrated compound was prepared on a Hamilton STARPlus CORE in a 96-well plate (Greiner, #651201) using a 1:3 ten-point dose response format. Following compound addition, a 2.2 ug/ml working concentration of STING membrane (SEQ. ID. No. 3) was prepared by diluting concentrated membrane into assay buffer (lx PBS; Invitrogen # SH30028.02) and douncing 7× using a manual tissue homogenizer (Wheaton, #357546). 148 uL of this prepared membrane was then manually added to each well of a 96-well deep-well polypropylene plate (Fisher Scientific, #12-566-121). Compound, ligand, and membrane then incubated for 60 min at RT before the contents of each assay plate were filtered through a 96-well GF/B filter plate (PerkinElmer, #6005250) using a TOMTEC MACH III Cell Harvester equipped with 20 mM HEPES buffer (Fisher Scientific, # BP299500). The filter plates were then dried at 55° C. for 30 min using a pressurized VWR oven before 30 uL of ULTIMA GOLD F scintillate was added to each well. Tritium levels for each reaction well were then measured using a PerkinElmer TopCount plate reader.
After normalization to controls, the percent activity for each compound concentration was calculated by measuring the amount of remaining radioactivity. The plot of percent activity versus the log of compound concentration was fit with a 4-parameter dose response equation to calculate EC50 values.
The final reaction conditions were:

Full-Length STING (WT) Virus Generation
STING virus was generated using an insect cell baculovirus system. Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21 cells (Kempbio, Inc.) were diluted to 5e5 cells/ml in Sf-900II SFM media (LifeTechnologies #10902088) without antibiotics. The cell suspension was added to each well of a treated 6-well plate (2 mL per well, 1e6 cells total), and the cells were allowed to adhere for at least 30 min. Meanwhile, a 1 mL co-transfection mix was assembled by combining 500 ng of WT STING[STING(1-379)H232R-gg-AviTag-gs-HRV3C-HIS8/pBAC1] (Genewiz custom synthesis) with 1 mL Sf-900II SFM media containing 10 μL CELLFECTIN® II Reagent (Invitrogen #10362100) and 100 ng viral backbone BestBac 2.0, v-cath/chiA Deleted Linearized Baculovirus DNA (Expression Systems #91-002). The transfection mixtures were allowed to incubate for 30 min. After incubation, media was gently removed from the adhered cells in the 6-well plate, the 1 mL transfection mixtures were added (1 mL per well), and the plate was placed in a humidified incubator at 27° C. The following day, 1 mL Sf-900II SFM media (no antibiotics) was added to each well of the 6-well plate. After media addition, the cells were allowed to incubate with DNA [(SEQ. ID. No. 4) and linearized viral backbone BestBac 2.0] at 27° C. for 5-7 days to generate the P0 viral stock. To generate P1 viral stocks, 0.5 mL of P0 viral supernatant was added to 50 mL uninfected Sf21 cells (seeded the day prior to infection at a density of 5×105 cells/mL to allow for one overnight doubling) in Sf-900II SFM media containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin (Invitrogen #15710072). The infected cells were then incubated at 27° C. for 3 days while shaking at 110 rpm (ATR Biotech Multitron Infors HT #AJ118). On day 3, P1 cultures were counted using a ViCell XR (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences #383556) to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 85-95%). Cultures were harvested in 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged at 2000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The P1 viral supernatants were poured off into clean 50 ml centrifuge tubes, and the remaining P1 cell pellets were used to generate Baculovirus Infected Insect Cells (BIICs). Cryopreservation media containing Sf-900II SFM media with 10% heat inactivated FBS, 10% DMSO (Sigma #D2650), and 5 μg/ml gentamicin was prepared and sterilized through 0.2204 filter immediately prior to use. P1 cell pellets were resuspended to a density of 2e7 cells/ml and aliquoted into cryovials (1 mL per vial). Cryovials were placed in MR. FROSTY™ cell freezers O/N at −80° C. and transferred to liquid nitrogen for long term storage the following day. To generate P2 viral stock, 0.5 mL of the P1 viral supernatant was added to 50 mL uninfected Sf21 cells (seeded the day prior to infection at a density of 5×105 cells/mL to allow for one overnight doubling) in Sf-900II SFM media containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin. These cells were incubated at 27° C. for 3 days while shaking at 110 rpm before harvesting P2 stock with centrifugation at 2000×g for 10 min at 4° C. The P2 viral supernatants were poured off and discarded, while the P2 cell pellets were used to generate P2 BIICs following the same protocol described above. The baculovirus generation protocol has been validated to consistently produce P1/P2 BIICs with titers of 2e9 pfu/mL (2e7 cells/mL×100 pfu/cell).
Full-Length STING (WT) Expression
To generate STING membranes, P1/P2 BIICs were amplified overnight by adding thawed BIICs to Sf21 cells seeded at a density of 1.0×106 cells/mL. The volume of BIIC used to infect the culture was calculated using an assumed BIIC titer of 2e9 pfu/ml to achieve an MOI of 10 in the overnight amplification. After culturing overnight, the cells were counted on a ViCell XR to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 80-90%). The volume of infected Sf21 cells from the overnight amplification used to infect the large-scale expression of Trichoplusia ni (T. ni; Expression Systems, cat #94-002F, www.expressionsystems.com) seeded at a density of 1.0×106 in cell media (ESF921 SFM containing 5 μg/mL gentamicin) at MOI=2.0 was calculated based on (100 pfu/infected Sf21 cell). The cells were allowed to express for 48 h at 27° C. before harvesting the cell pellet, by centrifugation at 3,400×g for 10 min at 4° C. T. ni cells were counted on a ViCell XR to confirm infection had occurred (cell size ≥3 μm larger than uninfected cells and viability approximately 80-90%) prior to harvest.
Full-Length STING (WT) Membrane Generation
Buffer Stock Reagents:
1) 1 M HEPES pH 7.5, Teknova, Cat#H1035
2) 5 M NaCl, Sigma Aldrich, Cat#S5150-1L
3) KCl, Sigma Aldrich, Cat#319309-500ML
4) Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets, Roche Diagnostics, Cat#11873580001
5) Benzonase, Universal Nuclease, Pierce, Cat#88702
Lysis buffer [25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, (Benzonase 1:5000, Complete Protease Inhibitor tab/50 mL)] was added to the pellet of cells expressing full-length STING (WT) prepared above at 5 mL Lysis buffer per g of cell pellet. The pellet was resuspended and dounced twenty times using a Wheaton Dounce Homogenizer to disrupt the cell membrane. Homogenized lysate was then passed through the emulsiflex-05 microfluidizer at a pressure close to 5000 PSI. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged at 36,000 rpm (100,000×g) in a 45Ti rotor ultra-high speed centrifuge for 45 min, 4° C. The supernatant was removed. The pellet then was resuspended in wash buffer [(25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 1M NaCl (Complete Protease Inhibitor tab/50 mL)] at a volume of 50 mL/pellet/centrifuge tube. The pellet/wash buffer mixture was then homogenized, using a glass homogenizer on ice (20 strokes), followed by centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 45 min at 4° C. The supernatant was removed. The wash step was repeated once more. The resulting membrane was resuspended in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitors (1 tablet/50 mL). The protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Protein Assay, Cat#500-0006), and protein enrichment was determined by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by Western blot. The resuspended membranes were stored at −80° C.

Example 57: IFN-β Secretion in THP1 Cell Culture (5 h)
The ability of compounds to stimulate the secretion of interferon-beta from THP1 cells was measured using a human IFN-β AlphaLISA kit (Perkin Elmer, Cat. No. AL265F). The basic protocol is as follows:
A Labcyte Echo 550 acoustic dispenser was used to transfer 120 nL of compound dissolved in DMSO into the wells of an empty, sterile 384-well microplate, (Corning, Cat. No. 3712). THP1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Cat. No. TIB202) previously frozen in Recovery Medium (Life Technologies, Cat. No. 12648-010) were thawed and immediately diluted 10-fold into 37° C. assay medium (RPMI 1640+L-Glutamine & phenol red, Life Technologies, Cat. No. 11875-085; 0.5% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, Sigma Aldrich, Cat. No. F4135; 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, Life Technologies, Cat. No. 11360-070; lx non-essential amino acids; Life Technologies, Cat. No. 11140-050). The cell viability and count was ascertained using a Beckman Coulter V-Cell XR cell counter. The cells suspension was centrifuged at 200×g for 5 min at RT. Cells were resuspended to a density of 0.8×106/mL in 37° C. assay medium. Subsequent liquid transfers were performed using either a Matrix electronic multichannel pipette or an Agilent Bravo Automated Liquid Handling Platform.
The assay was started by dispensing 40 μL of the previously prepared cell suspension into the wells of the plate containing compounds. After 5 h incubation at 37° C., 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere, the plate of cells and compounds was centrifuged at 200×g for 5 min at RT. From each well, 5 μL of supernatant was transferred into corresponding wells of a white 384-well plate (Perkin Elmer, Cat. No. 6005620). To these supernatant-containing wells was added 10 μL of 5× Anti-Analyte Acceptor beads (50 μg/mL of AlphaLISA HiBlock Buffer) and incubated for 30 min at RT while shaking on an orbital plate shaker. To each well was added 104, of 5× Biotinylated Antibody Anti-analyte (5 nM in AlphaLISA HiBlock Buffer) and incubated on an orbital plate shaker for 60 min at RT or overnight at 4° C. To each well was added 25 μL of 2×SA-Donor beads (80 μg/mL in AlphaLISA HiBlock Buffer) and incubated for 30-45 min at RT in the dark while shaking on an orbital plate shaker. The plate was then read on a Perkin Elmer Envision (λex=680 nm, λem=570 nm). The percent effect of the AlphaLISA signal at each compound concentration was calculated based on 30 uM cGAMP positive controls and 0.3% DMSO negative controls. The plot of percent effect versus the log of compound concentration was fit with a 4-parameter concentration response equation to calculate EC50 values. The test compounds were tested at concentrations 30000, 10000, 3333, 1111, 370.4, 123.4, 41.2, 13.7, 4.6, and 1.5 nM with 0.3% residual DMSO. The control compound, cGAMP was tested at concentrations 100000, 33333, 11111, 3704, 1235, 412, 137, 46, and 15 nM with 0.3% residual DMSO.
Compounds of the disclosure were evaluated for IFN-r3 secretion in THP1 cell culture as described above. The following table tabulates the biological data for these compounds as percent activation relative to 2'3'-cGAMP at the 30 μM concentration.
