TECHNICAL FIELD
The present application provides indole-2-carboxamide compounds useful for the treatment of non-tuberculosis bacterial infections.
BACKGROUND
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are opportunistic pathogens, where the prevalence of NTM pulmonary infections in the United States is increasing. Transmission of these pathogens may occur both from environmental sources and from person-to-person. The Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) and Mycobacterium abscessus complex (MABSC) are the two species that account for the vast majority (70-95%) of global NTM infections. While MAC is still, overall, the most common cause of NTM infections in the US (accounting for over 70% of NTM pulmonary infections), over the last 10 years, rapidly-growing NTM of the M. abscessus complex (including the subspecies M. abscessus, M. massiliense and M. bolletii) have emerged as important human pathogens globally, causing an increasing number of pulmonary infections among patients with structural lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis (CF). MABSC species cause serious, life-threatening chronic lung disease, are responsible for disseminated, often fatal, infections following lung transplantation and are associated with a higher fatality rate than any other rapidly growing mycobacteria. Of growing concern is the report that the prevalence of MABSC infections is becoming higher than that of MAC infections in CF patients worldwide, and that MABSC infections tend to target the younger CF population and those with more severe lung disease. Depending on study site, prevalence rates of MABSC infections among children and adult CF patients range from 5% to 48%. MABSC infection in CF patients is particularly problematic as it results in accelerated inflammatory lung damage, can be impossible to treat (with 60-70% treatment failures despite years of combination therapy), and precludes lung transplantation in many US and European centers. MABSC species are indeed not only the most pathogenic rapidly growing mycobacteria, they are also the most antibiotic-resistant NTM. There are many factors that contribute to the drug resistance or drug tolerance of these microorganisms and as a result, the 2007 American Thoracic Society treatment guidelines cite no proven regimens to treat M. abscessus pulmonary infections. Current treatment recommendations include multidrug therapy with combinations of intravenous and oral antibiotics accompanied, in some cases, by surgical resection. Furthermore, most likely reflecting a defect in primary lung defense mechanisms, MABSC strains responsible for lung infections tend to co-occur with other pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are ubiquitous environmental pathogens that can cause a wide variety of infections, such as: progressive pulmonary disease, skin and soft tissue infections, lymphadenitis, and disseminated disease (see e.g., Brown-Elliott et al, Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2002, 15:716-746; and Faria et al, J. Pathog. 2015, 809014). The most common human pathogens are the species M. avium complex (MAC) and M. kansasii, however other clinically relevant species include the M. abscessus complex (MABSC, including the subspecies M. abscessus, M. massiliense and M. bolletii) and M. fortuitum (see e.g., Griffith et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007, 175:367-416). NTM commonly cause pulmonary disease in older, immunocompromised patients who have underlying lung disease.
The precise frequency of NTM disease is unknown because reporting for NTM is not mandatory in the United States and many other countries (see e.g., Bodle et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2008, 14:390-396; and van der Werf et al, BMC Infect. Dis. 2014, 14:62). Furthermore, current incidence and prevalence data are likely underestimated due to the indolent nature of NTM pulmonary disease, the most common form of NTM infections. A growing number of studies suggest that the number of NTM infections and mortality rates continue to increase (see e.g., Bodle et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2008, 14:390-396; and Thomson et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2010, 16:1576-1583). Growing prevalence of NTM isolates between 1997 (9.1/100,000) and 2003 (14.1/100,000) has been observed in Ontario, Canada (see e.g., Marras et al, Thorax, 2007, 62:661-666). More recently, Taiwan has reported increasing incidence of NTM disease, 10.2 cases per 100,000 persons in 2008 compared to 2.7 cases per 100,000 persons in 2000 (see e.g., Hernandez-Garduno et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2010, 16:1047-1048; and Lai et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2010, 16:294-296). In addition, estimates from 1999 to 2010 suggest the number of immediate NTM-related deaths in the United States rose significantly and are expected to increase over the next few years, given the increasing median age in North America (see e.g., Mirsaeidi et al, PLoS One, 2014, 9:e91879). Although NTM are opportunistic pathogens, they represent a matter of significant concern to health practitioners because of increasing incidence and mortality rates. As the number of patients with immune-compromising conditions continues to grow, both opportunistic and primary cases of NTM infection present a significant challenge for current antibiotic therapy.
In contrast to the insidious nature of NTM infections, M. tuberculosis is the cause of highly transmittable disease and infects about one-third of the world's population (see e.g., Global Tuberculosis Report, World Health Organization: Geneva, 2015). In 2015, tuberculosis (TB) became the leading infectious disease killer in the world and caused illness in approximately 9.6 million people, killing 1.5 million each year (see e.g., Global Tuberculosis Report, World Health Organization: Geneva, 2015). The global incidence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) remains unchanged at 3.3%, causing growing concern for healthcare professionals. MDR-TB is classified as resistant to both rifampicin and isoniazid, two antibiotics used in standard treatment. This form of TB goes largely undetected, as the estimated number of cases of MDR-TB in 2014 was 480,000 people and the number of these patients who were started on appropriate treatment was only about 111,000. Currently, there are few narrow spectrum antimycobacterial antibiotics. The current treatment of NTM recommended by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) includes regimens of multiple antibiotics, potentially including macrolides, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, oxazolidinones, tigecycline, carbapenems, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, ethambutol, and rifampicin (see e.g., Griffith et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007, 175:367-416). Many of these recommendations are made on the basis of preliminary in vitro efficacy studies due to the lack of a standardized animal model. Depending on the organism and site of infection, two to four of these agents are often used in combination for a duration of at least 12 months after the first negative culture. The use of multiple antibiotics for prolonged periods of time is challenging due to common complications such as drug interactions and noncompliance.
Problems surrounding current anti-TB therapy are similar to that of NTM. The treatment of drug-susceptible TB focuses on the same four-antibiotic regimen (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide) introduced more than 40 years ago (see e.g., Global Tuberculosis Report, World Health Organization: Geneva, 2015). The therapy typically requires the use of multiple antibiotics and is long in duration; these are both factors contributing to non-compliance and treatment failure, which can lead to the emergence of MDR-TB and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB). The treatment of MDR-TB/XDR-TB is more difficult and requires multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics, which exposes patients to complications like Clostridium difficile infections and other resistant microorganisms (see e.g., Jernberg et al, Microbiology, 2010, 156:3216-3223). Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of drug-resistant TB are currently under development by the ATS and IDSA (see e.g., Nahid et al, Clin. Infect. Dis. 2016, 63:e147-195). Depending on the susceptibilities of particular drug-resistant TB strains, second-line anti-TB drugs are typically used for a duration of 2 years and treatment success rates range from 30 to 80%, underscoring the need for newer anti-mycobacterial drugs and treatment regimens that maximize efficacy and shorten duration of treatment (see e.g., Burgos et al, Clin. Infect. Dis. 2005, 40:968-975; Chan et al, Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2004, 169:1103-1109; Espinal et al, Jama, 2000, 283:2537-2545; Gobel et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 1993, 328:527-532; Leimane et al, Lancet, 2005, 365:318-326; Marks et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2014, 20:812-821; Nathanson et al, Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2006, 12:1389-1397; and Tahaoglu et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 2001, 345:170-174).
Current drugs that are in the pharmaceutical pipeline for mycobacterial infections are largely being used against M. tuberculosis and not specifically against NTM. In pre-clinical and clinical trials, drugs in the pipeline are often studied in combination drug regimens with other broad-spectrum antibiotics. Furthermore, these drugs, including DC-159a (see e.g., Disratthakit et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2010, 54:2684-2686), SQ-641 (see e.g., Dubuisson et al, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2010, 65:2590-2597), CPZEN-45 (see e.g., Ishizaki et al, J. Biol. Chem. 2013, 288:30309-30319), BTZ043 (see e.g., Makarov et al, Science, 2009, 324:801-804), bedaquiline (see e.g., Lerat et al, J. Infect. Dis. 2014, 209:905-912), and pretomanid (see e.g., Manjunatha et al, Commun. Integr. Biol. 2009, 2:215-218), lack bactericidal activity against many NTM species. The development of narrow-spectrum anti-mycobacterial drugs could revolutionize the treatment of both TB and NTM.
Indole-2-carboxamides (IC) have been reported as novel antitubercular agents with activity against drug-resistant strains and in in vivo efficacy mouse models (see e.g., Kondreddi et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2013, dx.doi.org/10.1021/jm4012774; Lun et al, Nat. Commun. 2013, 4:2907; Onajole et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2013, 56:4093-4103; Rao et al, Sci. Transl. Med. 2013, 5:214ra168; and Stec et al, J. Med. Chem. 2016, 59(13):6232-6247). IC are bioisosteric isomers of published urea-based M. tuberculosis inhibitors and have similar structure activity relationships (see e.g., Brown et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2011, 19:5585-5595; North et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2013, 21:2587-2599; and Scherman et al, Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2012, 20:3255-3262). The expansion of both the chemical space for the published antitubercular IC compounds and the spectrum of antimycobacterial activity of such compounds is described herein. In addition, lead compounds have demonstrated a safe pharmacological profile and are inhibitors of the mycolic acid biosynthetic pathway in both TB and NTM strains. Specifically, they inhibit the translocation of trehalose-monomycolate (TMM) to the outer membrane, suggestive of Mycobacteria membrane protein large 3 (MmpL3) inhibition. A novel series of highly potent indole-based anti-NTM agents is described herein.

Synthesis
Indole-2-carboxamide (IC) compounds of Formula I were generated using published methods and is shown in Scheme 1 (see e.g., Onajole et al, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 2013, 56:4093-4103). Briefly, the reaction of the arylhydrazine with ethyl pyruvate in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (pTsOH) afforded ethyl indole-2-carboxylate (step a). After NaOH-mediated saponification of the ester (step b), commercially available amines were coupled to indole-2-carboxylic acid using standard coupling conditions (step c).

Pharmaceutical Compositions
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds and salts provided herein can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can be prepared as described herein or elsewhere, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (e.g., transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal, and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral, or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, (e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration). Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, for example, by a continuous perfusion pump.
Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers (e.g., excipients). In making the compositions provided herein, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, for example, a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions, and sterile packaged powders.
The active ingredient can be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a pharmaceutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual subject, the severity of the subject's symptoms, and the like.
EXAMPLES
The compounds described herein have been synthesized and tested against a panel of mycobacteria including M. abscessus, M. massiliense, M. bollettii, M. chelonae, M. avium, M. xenopi, M. tuberculosis, and M. smegmatis. Eight compounds exhibited highly potent anti-NTM activity with sub-μg/mL minimum inhibitor concentrations (MIC) in the range of 0.0039-0.25 μg/mL. Interestingly, seven compounds showed highly potent activity against M. xenopi, with sub-μg/mL MIC values in the range of 0.06-1 μg/mL. Four compounds had activity against M. avium, with MIC values in the range of 0.25-8 μg/mL. Drug-resistant M. smegmatis strains were generated to the active compounds which show mutations in the mmpl3 gene, which is the gene that codes for the mycolic acid transporter, MmpL3. MmpL proteins are conserved across all mycobacterial species and are presumed to be the target for these indole-based compounds. Macromolecular analysis of M. abscessus treated with the indole-based compounds show the inhibition of mycolic acid transport, further indicating that these compounds are inhibiting NTM MmpL proteins, as shown in FIGS. 1A-1B. Minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) have been determined for four IC compounds (5, 16, 25, and 31) that show potent MBC values similar to corresponding MIC values.
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from commercial sources. The chemical reactions were tracked by TLC using Biotage Silica Gel 60F254 plates and spots were visualized by UV lamp or 12 condensation. Compounds were purified using a Biotage SP silica gel column on a Biotage Isolera One. 1H and 13C NMR were recorded on a 400 MHz Bruker NMR and chemical shifts were reported relative to solvent peak. Analytical RP-HPLC was determined on a Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with an Acquity BEH C18 column (1.7 μm), flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and a gradient of solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid): 0-0.25 min 97% A; 0.25-3.0 min 3-100% B (linear gradient); 3.0-4.5 min 100% B; 4.5-4.75 min 0-97% A (linear gradient); 4.75-5.0 min 97% A. UV absorbance at 254 nm was used as the detection method. All compounds were found to have >95% purity with the described analytical methods.

MIC values against a number of clinical isolates of mycobacteria and other bacterial species were determined in 96-well microtiter plates using the colorimetric resazurin microtiter assay (see e.g., Martin et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003, 47:3616-3619) and visually scanning for growth. MIC values against M. tuberculosis H37Rv mc26206 were determined in 7H9-ADC-0.05% tyloxapol medium supplemented with 0.2% casaminoacids, 48 μg/mL pantothenate and 50 μg/mL L-leucine. MICs against M. smegmatis mc2155 were determined in 7H9-ADC-0.05% Tween 80. MICs against M. abscessus ATCC 19977, M. abscessus 21, M. abscessus 103, M. massiliense CIP108297, M. massiliense 1513, M. massiliense CRM-0019, M. massiliense CRM-0270, M. massiliense 105, M. bolletii ATCC 14472, M. bolletii 88, M. chelonae ATCC 35752, M. chelonae 28, M. chelonae 49, M. chelonae 69, M. kansasii 662, M. avium 104, M. intracellulare 1956, M. xenopi 4042, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO-1 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 were determined in Mueller Hinton II (BD). MBC90 values were determined by subculture from the MIC wells onto 7H11 agar and defined as the lowest concentration reducing CFU by 90% relative to the inoculum.
Table 1 shows the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for the synthesized unsubstituted IC compounds (MIC values reported in μg/mL). Overall, these compounds had limited pan-antimycobacterial activity as demonstrated by inhibition from compounds 5 and 16. Excluding M. smegmatis, compounds 5 and 16 show the best antimycobacterial activity with sub-μg/mL MIC values and compound 16 obtaining 2-4-fold increased activity over 5. An adamantyl substitution in compound 5 conferred activity, however the 3-ethyl adamantyl (6) or adamantyl with an ethyl or methyl linker (7, 8) was less tolerated. Interestingly, changing the connection point from the 1-position (5) to the 2-position (9) on adamantine abolished anti-NTM activity, however potent activity was retained against M. tuberculosis. The methyl-linked adamantyl substitution on compound 8 elicited greater activity against NTM than the larger ethyl-linked compound 7, suggesting an upper limit for linker bulk. Saturated cycloalkyl rings that are 8 carbons or smaller (10, 11, 12, and 13) abolished all anti-NTM activity. However, adding methyl components to smaller aliphatic rings can increase activity as seen with the isopinocampheyl substituted (16), which attained the highest pan-activity of the series.
The antitubercular SAR was much looser, as the constraints on for the bulky aliphatic group are less restrictive. A cyclooctyl (10) substituent maintained antimicrobial activity against M. tuberculosis with an MIC of 0.39 μg/mL, despite being absent for NTM species. However, smaller rings like cycloheptyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclopentyl (11, 12, and 13) are not tolerated for any species. There remained modest anti-TB activity with the 3-ethyl adamantyl (6) with an MIC of 1.25 μg/mL.

The second series evaluated for pan-antimycobacterial activity was the 4,6-dimethyl indole substitution, and this substitution pattern contributed to greater potency against the mycobacterial panel than with the unsubstituted indole compounds as demonstrated in Table 2 (MIC values reported in μg/mL). The most potent pan-activity was observed with cyclooctyl (25) and cycloheptyl (26) head groups with MIC values ranging from 0.0039 to 0.625 m/mL, depending on the species of Mycobacterium. The 4-methylcyclohexyl substituted compounds (29 and 30) also displayed significant anti-NTM and anti-TB activity with the exception of M. smegmatis. The pure trans isomer (29) and cis/trans mixture (30) achieved the same MIC values showing no preference for stereochemical orientation at the 4-position. The dimethyl indole series allowed for smaller aliphatic substituents, presumably through the maintaining of lipophilicity from the dimethyl groups. Aliphatic rings smaller than cyclooctyl conferred anti-mycobacterial activity that was not present in the unsubstituted indoles 11, 12, 13 and 14. Substituents the size of the cyclooctyl (25) or cycloheptyl (26) had activity against M. abscessus, M. massiliense, M. bolletii, M. chelonae, M. smegmatis, and M. tuberculosis but began to lose potency as the ring size decreases, until any clinically relevant activity is lost at a size of a cyclopentyl (28). Compounds with substitutions larger than adamantyl (20, 21, 22, 23) lost all anti-MAB SC NTM activity. Comparable to the unsubstituted indoles of Table 1, activity against M. tuberculosis in the dimethyl series was less sensitive to substituent size than that of NTM species. The majority of these compounds (20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, and 31) exhibited anti-tuberculous activity with MIC values ranging from 0.00195 to 0.625 μg/mL.

Regarding the unsubstituted ICs, only two compounds demonstrated sub-μg/mL pan-activity potencies compared to six dimethyl ICs. Furthermore, preference for bulky aliphatic rings is shown, since potency was lost with decreasing ring size in both series, albeit more drastically in the unsubstituted series. It was clearly seen that the 4,6-dimethylated indole is preferred due to the acquisition of previously absent anti-mycobacterial activity (25, 26-29), which is most likely due to the boost in lipophilicity from the two methyl groups. Supporting this observation was the attainment of anti-NTM activity for smaller saturated cycloalkyl substitutions (Table 2, compounds 25, 26, 27, 29, and 30) when the indole ring was dimethylated. The anti-NTM activity seen with adamantyl (Table 1, 5) in the unsubstituted ICs was abolished when the indole was 4,6-dimethylated (Table 2, 20), however, this was not the case for the isopinocampheyl substitution in either series (Table 1, 16 and Table 2, 31). It seems when this minimum liphophilic threshold is not met, such as with the aliphatic rings smaller than an 8-carbon ring size in the unsubstituted series (Table 1, 10, 11, 12, and 13), the compounds suffered a loss of activity. Lastly, no anti-mycobacterial activity was observed in either series for uncyclized straight alkyl chains (Table 1, compounds 17, 18; table 2, compounds 32, 33).
The compounds were also tested against MAC strains including M. avium and M. xenopi to further evaluate the spectrum of anti-mycobacterial activity of the IC compounds, (Table 3; MIC values reported in μg/mL). Compounds that were not effective anti-mycobacterial agents were not tested. Overall, current IC compounds were more active against M. xenopi over M. avium. The best potential candidate for pan-activity against mycobacteria was the cyclooctyl substituted 4,6-dimethyl-indole (25), which also showed the most potent activity in this panel with MIC values ranging from 0.25-1 μg/mL. Compounds 26 and 31 also showed good activity against M. avium in addition to M. xenopi with MIC values between 2-4 μg/mL.

Lead compounds in this IC series appeared to be selective for mycobacteria, as IC compounds 5, 16, 25, 26, 30 and 31 were inactive against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (Table 4). All compounds tested showed no bacterial growth inhibition up to 160 μg/mL, except for 16, which inhibited S. aureus growth at 40 μg/mL.

Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values were determined for IC compounds 16, 25, 26 and 30. For these tested IC compounds, MBC90 values were highly potent and similar to determined MIC values. MBC90 values for IC 16, 25, 26, and 30 were 0.06, 0.015, 0.015 and 0.03 μg/mL, respectively.
Example 34. Cytotoxicity Assays
The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined by measuring THP-1 cell viability after 3 days in the presence of test compounds. Compounds were prepared as 10-point serial dilutions in DMSO. The highest concentration of compound tested was 50 μM where compounds were soluble in DMSO at 10 mM. THP-1 cells were cultured in complete RPMI and differentiated into macrophage-like cells using 80 nM PMA overnight at 37° C., 5% CO2. Cells were inoculated into assay plates and cultured for 24 h before compound dilutions were added to a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Each run included staurosporine as a control. Assay plates were incubated for 3 days at 37° C., 5% CO2, growth was measured using the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) which uses ATP as an indicator of cell viability. Relative luminescent units (RLU) were measured using a Biotek Synergy 4 plate reader. The dose response curve was fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. The IC50 was defined as the compound concentration that resulted in 50% viability.
The cytotoxicity of compounds 5, 16, 25, and 31 was tested against THP-1 cells, a human cell line (Table 5). With the exception of Compound 16 (TD50 of 11.3 μg/mL), the ICs were found not to be cytotoxic up to 50 μM. Across several Mycobacterium species, these compounds have exceptional selectivity indices, ranging from 22.6 to at least 3,800. Compound 25, the most potent of the scaffold, shows the most promise against NTM, with selectivity indices of >1,910 for M. abscessus, M. massiliense, and M. bolleti, while compound 31 holds the most selectivity against M. tuberculosis.

Example 35. Metabolic Labeling and Mycolic Acid Analysis
Cultures of M. massiliense 1513 grown to mid log-phase in Mueller-Hinton II broth were incubated with different concentrations of inhibitors for 16 hr at 37° C. with shaking. 0.5 μCi/mL [1,2-14C]acetic acid (specific activity, 52 Ci/mol, PerkinElmer Inc.) was added at the same time as the inhibitors. Total lipids and cell wall-bound mycolic acid methyl esters were prepared from treated and untreated cells and analyzed by TLC as described in Grzegorzewicz et al, Nature Chemical Biology, 2012, 8:334+341. TLCs were revealed and semi-quantified using a Phosphorlmager (Typhoon, GE Healthcare).
IC compounds, including compound 5, have been reported to target the M. tuberculosis trehalose monomycolate (TMM) transporter, MmpL3, resulting in an inhibition of the transfer of mycolic acids to their cell envelope acceptors, arabinogalactan and trehalose dimycolates (TDM).29,31,36 To determine whether the NTM inhibitors identified herein displayed a similar activity on M. abscessus complex strains, cultures of M. massiliense strain 1513 treated with different concentrations of compounds 5, 16, 25 and 31 were metabolically labeled with [1,2-14C]acetate and their lipid and cell wall-bound mycolic acid contents analyzed by TLC. Inhibitor treatments resulted in a concentration-dependent build-up of TMM in the cells that accompanied a decrease in mycolic acid transfer onto cell wall arabinogalactan and TDM (FIGS. 1A-1B). Inhibitor concentration-dependence was less marked in the case of compound 5. Thus, similar to the situation in M. tuberculosis, the IC described herein did not inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis per se but rather the transfer of these products to their cell envelope acceptors. It is likely that the killing of M. abscessus complex strains that ensues results from the inhibition of the formation of their outer membrane.
Example 36. Activity of Indole-2-Carboximides Against M. abscessus
MIC testing was performed by microbroth dilution method using Mueller Hinton (MH) broth (Cation Adjusted) to the calcium and magnesium ion concentration recommended in the CLSI standard M7-A7 (Becton Dickinson). MIC testing also was performed by microbroth dilution method using 7H9 broth (Sigma-Aldrich). The justification for use of both MH and 7H9 broth for compound screening is anti-mycobacterial compounds can display different MIC activity depending on the broth that is used in the MIC assay. Rapid growing NTMs were grown on 7H11 agar plates (Sigma-Aldrich) for 3 days at 35-37° C. in ambient air (depending on bacterial strain). Slow growing (SG) NTMs were grown on agar 7H11 plates (Sigma-Aldrich) for 21-30 days at 37° C. in ambient air. The CFUs were taken from the agar plates and placed in either MH or 7H9 broth with 0.05% Tween-80 and grown at 35-37° C. in ambient air until the optical density (OD) absorbance taken after 3 days (RGM) or 12 (SG) of growth had an (OD) 0.08-0.1 (0.5 McFarland Standard). The bacterial cell suspensions were then confirmed by preparing them in saline, matching the (OD) 0.08-0.1 (0.5 McFarland Standard). The broth (MH or 7H9) 180 μL was added to the first column in the 96-well plates. Then 100 μl of the broth (MH or 7H9) was added to the other columns in the 96 well plate. Compounds solutions were prepared at 1.28 mg/mL in DMSO (supplier recommended) and used immediately in the test range of 64-0.062 m/mL; 20 μL of compound was added to the first column of wells and 100 μl was serially diluted. Finally, 100 μl of NTM cell suspension was added in all the wells except the media only control wells. QC agents specific for each organism were assayed, including 1) a bacteria only negative control; 2) a media only negative control; 3) a (CLA) clarithromycin positive drug control; and 4) an optional E. coli control. RGMs were assayed for ODs on day 3, and SL on day 12. After that, the plate was assayed by using the Resazurin Microtiter Assay Plate method as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratories Standards Institute. Briefly, the method uses the addition of resazurin (7-Hydroxy-3H-phenoxazin-3-one 10-oxide) to the MIC 96 well plate. Resazurin is a blue dye, itself weakly fluorescent until it is irreversibly reduced to the pink colored and highly red fluorescent resorufin.
The indolecarboxamides series of compounds 5, 16, 25, and 31 all demonstrated MICs of 16 μg/mL (MH broth) comparable to the positive control of clarithromycin (MIC of 16 μg/mL (7H9) and 4 μg/mL (MH)) and amikacin (MIC 8 μg/mL (7H9) and 4 μg/mL (MH)) against M. abscessus subsp. bolletii 103, as shown in Table 6. Respectively, both compounds 5 and 25 demonstrated increased activity with an MIC of 32 μg/mL (MH) and MIC of 16 μg/mL (MH) compared to the positive controls clarithromycin (MIC of >64 μg/mL (7H9) and >64 μg/mL (MH)) and amikacin (MIC>64 μg/mL (7H9) and >64 μg/mL (MH)) against M. abscessus subsp. abscessus 1513.

Example 37. In Vivo Acute Toxicity Assay
6-8 week old Balb/C female mice were ordered from Charles River. Mice were rested one to two weeks before dosing. For each dose of compound, 3 mice were utilized. Mice will be dosed at 40, 75 and 100 mg/kg. Compound was given twice per day for 3 consecutive days by gavage, at 100 μl/mouse. Compounds were prepared the day before or the day of dosing and stored at 4° C. until dosing. The time of dosing was recorded for each mouse. Observations were recorded immediately, at 10 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 24 hours after dosing. Any animals that showed signs of toxicity were euthanized in accordance with Colorado State University IACUC guidelines. Mice were dosed for three days and on the fourth day mice were observed twice daily for two days, then once daily for five days. In case the compound was found to show any adverse effects, a second multiple-day MTD model was performed using a lower concentration range of the experimental compound.
As an initial in vivo study, the safety of compounds and preliminary pharmacokinetics was assessed in an acute toxicity mouse model (Maximum Tolerated Dose assay, MTD) to evaluate any potential adverse effects and determine a safe dose for mouse efficacy studies. Compounds were tested to ensure safe use in healthy mice prior to any further in vivo testing. In this acute toxicity test, three healthy mice were given three consecutive daily doses of the compound and were observed at regular times for any adverse effects. Novel compounds were generally administered to mice at 40, 75 and 100 mg/kg in a tested formulation, administered on three consecutive days, 3 mice per dose group, in the chosen formulation. Doses higher than 300 mg/kg generally showed insolubility issues. Mice were observed 10 min, 1, 2, 4 hours after dosing and then daily afterwards. During the observations, humane handling practices and animal welfare regulations were strictly followed. In case the compound was found to show any adverse effects, a second multiple-day MTD model is performed using a lower concentration range of the experimental compound. Compounds 5 and 25 were well tolerated at 100, 200 and 300 mg/kg for 3 consecutive days of dosing. There were no adverse effects noted over the course of the study period.
Example 38. Dose Response Pharmacokinetic Parameters
Female BALB/c mice were given a dose of compounds 5 or 25 at 100, 200 and 300 mg kg' by oral gavage in a volume of 0.2 mL. At 2 and 4 hours after compound administration, animals were euthanized and cardiac blood (approximately 0.7 mL) was collected. Plasma was separated using centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4° C. and stored at 80° C. Concentrations of compounds 5 and 25 in plasma were analyzed with LC-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS, AB SCIEX QTRAP 5500 system) with warfarin as internal standard. MS detection of mass transitions 295.2/135.2 (Compound 5), 299.2/146.1 (Compound 25) and 309.1/163.0 (Warfarin) was carried out. Concentration calculation was performed with MultiQuant Software (Version 2.1, AB SCIEX). The pharmacokinetic profile of the test compound was analyzed from plasma concentration-time data after oral administration.
Comparative pharmacokinetic studies on the compounds 5 and 25 were carried out using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in order to determine the effective dose for the efficacy trial for growth inhibition of M. abscessus in vivo mouse model. A single dose of 100, 200 and 300 mg kg−1 of compounds 5 or 25 was administered orally to female Blab/c mice. As shown in FIG. 2, compound 25 showed a lower blood concentration at 100 and 200 mg kg−1 doses compared to compound 5, but it showed a similar concentration at a 300 mg kg−1 dose compared to compound 5. This indicate the better PK profile of compounds 5 and 25 at 300 mg kg−1. In view of these results, a dose of 300 mg kg−1 was selected to carry out the efficacy studies described in Example 39.
Example 39. In Vivo Efficacy Assays
6-8 week old SCID female mice were ordered from Charles River. Mice were rested one week before infection. The acute SCID mouse model received an intravenous infection via the tail vein with 1×106 CFU/mouse (M. abcessus strain 103). Three mice were sacrificed day 1 post-infection to determine bacterial uptake. Whole lungs, spleens, and livers were extracted, homogenized in 4.5 mL of 1×PBS, and plated at (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7) dilutions on 7H11 agar plates. The plates were placed in 37° C. dry-air incubator (strain dependent) for ˜7 days. Compound 5 or 25 was administered by gavage in a volume of 100 μl per mouse which began day 2 post-infection and continued for 8 consecutive days. Compounds 5 and 25 were dosed at 300 mg/kg PO. In control mice, amikacin (AMI) was dosed at 150 mg/kg SQ injection in a volume of 100 μl per mouse per day.
Mice were sacrificed 2 days after administering the last dose of compounds 5 or 25. Six mice of all groups (untreated, control amikacin, and indolecarboxamides treated mice) were sacrificed and bacterial loads were determined by plating lung homogenate at 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7, spleen at 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7 and liver at 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7. Log 10 protection values of at least 0.60 indicate activity was statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed by first converting CFU to logarithms, which were then evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison analysis of variance by a one-way Tukey test (SigmaStat software program). Differences were considered significant at the 95% level of confidence.
Antimicrobials:
Amikacin was used as a positive, inter-experiment control and was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Indolecarboxamides (compounds 5 and 25) were provided by Creighton University and diluted in an optimal formulation.
Intravenous Infection:
Working stocks of M. abcessus strain 103 were frozen in 1 mL aliquots and stored at −80° C. before use. For infection, an aliquot was thawed, disrupted 20 times with a 1 mL luer-lok syringe fitted with a 26 gauge needle, and diluted in sterile 1×PBS. Female SCID mice, aged seven to nine weeks, were infected by intravenous infection with 1×106 CFU/mouse. Three mice were sacrificed day 1 post-infection to determine bacterial uptake. For this purpose, whole lungs, spleens, and livers were removed aseptically, homogenized in 4.5 mL of PBS and serial 1:10 dilutions (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7) plated on 7H11/OADC agar plates. The plates were placed in a 37° C. dry-air incubator for ˜7 days.
Antimicrobial Treatment:
Treatment started 2 days post-infection (on day 2) and was continued for 8 consecutive days and given by gavage of compound 5 or 25 in vehicle in one dose determined by the formulation and MTD. The volume given was 100 μl per mouse once daily. The positive control was amikacin given SQ daily. All drugs were administered once daily.
Determination of Bacterial Load:
To determine the bacterial loads on day 1, 3 mice were sacrificed to determine CFU counts in lungs, spleens, and livers. At the treatment start, untreated mice were sacrificed on the day of treatment initiation (day 2) to determine the pre-treatment CFU counts in lungs, spleens, and livers. Whole lungs, spleens, and livers were removed aseptically and homogenized in 4.5 mL sterile PBS. Homogenates were serially diluted in 1:10 dilutions and dilutions (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7) plated on 7H11 agar plates.
Assessment of Treatment Efficacy:
1 day after the final treatment, mice were humanely euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation, followed by cervical dislocation. Lung, spleen and liver were aseptically removed. Whole lungs, spleens and livers were homogenized in 4.5 mL sterile PBS, and diluted 1:10. Dilutions (0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7) were plated on 7H11 agar plates and incubated at 37° C. in a dry air incubator for 7 days.
Analysis of Efficacy Data:
Lung, spleen and liver CFU numbers were log-transformed and evaluated by a one-way ANOVA followed by a multiple comparison analysis of variance by a one-way Tukey test (Graph pad software program). Differences were considered significant at the 95% level of confidence. All procedures involving animals were approved by the Colorado State University Animal Care and Use Committee.

The results of lung, spleen, and liver CFU counts are shown in FIGS. 3A-3C. The mean lung, spleen and liver log10 CFU at the start of drug treatment were 5.41±0.24, 5.41±0.15, and 6.17±0.33, respectively. Mice treated with daily doses of compound 5+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg, or compound 25+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg didn't demonstrate any significant weight loss in any of the groups and all animals survived until the Day 12 endpoint of the assay.
The log10 CFU lung, spleen and liver counts on day 12 of the mice treated with the different drugs were as follows: AMI alone (3.52±0.22, 3.12±0.30, and 4.03±0.62, respectively) and compound 5+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg (3.96±0.23, 3.79±0.40, and 5.30±0.23, respectively) and compound 25+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg (3.58±0.50, 2.91±0.45 and 4.90±0.49, respectively).
The compound 5+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg regimen resulted in CFU lung, spleen and liver counts that were approximately 3.96±0.23, 3.79±0.40, and 5.30±0.23 log10, respectively, which were higher than those in mice receiving AMI alone. The compound 25+20% cyclodextrin 300 mg/kg resulted in CFU lung, spleen and liver counts that were approximately 3.58±0.50, 2.91±0.45 and 4.90±0.49 log10, and showed lower CFU counts only in the spleen compared to those mice receiving AMI alone.
