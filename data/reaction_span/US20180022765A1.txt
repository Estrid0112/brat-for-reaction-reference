The present invention relates to a novel process for the alkoxycarbonylation of alcohols.
The alkoxycarbonylation of ethylenically unsaturated compounds is a known process for preparing esters. This method is used to react ethylenically unsaturated compounds (olefins) with carbon monoxide and alcohols in the presence of a metal-ligand complex to give the corresponding esters. Typically, the metal used is palladium. The following scheme shows the general reaction equation of an alkoxycarbonylation:
A very good catalytic system for this process was developed by Lucite-now Mitsubishi Rayon-and uses a ligand based on 1,2-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinomethyl)benzene (DTBPMB) (W. Clegg, G. R. Eastham, M. R. J. Elsegood, R. P. Tooze, X. L. Wang, K. Whiston, Chem. Commun. 1999, 1877-1878).
The possibility of using compounds other than ethylenically unsaturated compounds and reacting them with alcohols and CO to give the corresponding esters, in the form of an alkoxycarbonylation reaction, is hitherto unknown.
Against this background, the problem addressed by the present invention is that of providing an alkoxycarbonylation process for the preparation of esters, which uses raw materials other than ethylenically unsaturated compounds as a starting product. Of particular interest here is the use of alcohols as a starting product for the alkoxycarbonylation.
It has surprisingly emerged that this problem is solved by an alkoxycarbonylation process wherein particular benzene-based diphosphine ligands are used, in which at least one phosphine group is substituted by a heteroaryl radical. The process of the invention is notable for high yields, based on the alcohols used as reactants.
The invention therefore relates to a process comprising the following process steps:a) introducing a first alcohol, the first alcohol having 2 to 30 carbon atoms;b) adding a phosphine ligand and a compound which comprises Pd, or adding a complex comprising Pd and a phosphine ligand;c) adding a second alcohol;d) supplying CO;e) heating the reaction mixture, the first alcohol reacting with CO and the second alcohol to form an ester;
where the phosphine ligand is a compound of formula (I)

In this process, process steps a), b), c) and d) can be effected in any desired sequence. Typically, however, the addition of CO is effected after the co-reactants have been initially charged in steps a) to c). Steps d) and e) can be effected simultaneously or successively. In addition, CO can also be fed in in two or more steps, in such a way that, for example, a portion of the CO is first fed in, then the mixture is heated, and then a further portion of CO is fed in.

Preparation of chloro-2-pyridyl-tert-butylphosphine (Precursor A)
The Grignard for the synthesis of chloro-2-pyridyl-t-butylphosphine is prepared by the “Knochel method” with isopropylmagnesiurn chloride (Angew. Chem. 2004, 43, 2222-2226). The workup is effected according to the method of Budzelaar (Organometallics 1990, 9, 1222-1227).
8.07 ml of a 1.3 M isopropylmagnesium chloride solution (Knochel's reagent) are introduced into a 50 ml round-bottom flask with magnetic stirrer and septum, and cooled to −15° C.
Thereafter, 953.5 μl (10 mmol) of 2-bromopyridine are rapidly added dropwise. The solution immediately turns yellow. It is allowed to warm up to −10° C. The conversion of the reaction is determined as follows: about 100 μl solution are taken and introduced into 1 ml of a saturated ammonium chloride solution. If the solution “bubbles”, not much Grignard has formed yet. The aqueous solution is extracted with a pipette of ether and the organic phase is dried over Na2SO4. A GC of the ethereal solution is recorded. When a large amount of pyridine has formed compared to 2-bromopyridine, conversions are high. At −10° C., there has been little conversion. After warming up to room temperature and stirring for 1-2 hours, the reaction solution turns brown-yellow. A GC test shows complete conversion, Now the Grignard solution can be slowly added dropwise with a syringe pump to a solution of 1.748 g (11 mmol) of dichloro.tert-butylphosphine in 10 ml of THF which has been cooled to −15° C. beforehand. It is important that the dichloro-tert-butylphosphine solution is cooled. At room temperature, considerable amounts of dipyridyl-tert-butylphosphine would be obtained. A clear yellow solution is initially formed, which then turns cloudy. The mixture is left to warm up to room temperature and to stir overnight, According to GC-MS, a large amount of product has formed. The solvent is removed under high vacuum and a whitish solid which is brown in places is obtained. The solid is suspended with 20 ml of heptane and the solid is comminuted in an ultrasound bath. After allowing the white solid to settle out, the solution is decanted. The operation is repeated twice with 10-20 ml each time of heptane, After concentration of the heptane solution under high vacuum, it is distilled under reduced pressure. At 4.6 mbar, oil bath 120° C. and distillation temperature 98° C., the product can be distilled. 1.08 g of a colourless oil are obtained. (50%).

Preparation of Ligand 1 (α,α'-bis(2-pyridyl(t-butyl)phosphino)o-xylene)
675 mg (27.8 mmol, 4 eq) of Mg powder are weighed out in a glovebox in a 250 ml round-bottom flask with a nitrogen tap and magnetic stirrer bar, and the flask is sealed with a septum. High vacuum is applied to the round-bottom flask (about 5×10−2 mbar) and it is heated to 90° C. for 45 minutes. After cooling down to room temperature, 2 grains of iodine are added and the mixture is dissolved in 20 ml of THF. The suspension is stirred for about 10 minutes until the yellow colour of the iodine has disappeared. After the magnesium powder has settled out, the cloudy THF solution is decanted and the activated magnesium powder is washed twice with 1-2 ml of THF. Then another 20 ml of fresh THE are added. At room temperature, a solution of 1.21 g (6.9 mmol) of α,α'-dichloro-o-xylene in 70 ml of THF is slowly added dropwise with a syringe pump. The THF solution gradually turns a darker colour. The next day, the THF suspension is filtered to remove the unconverted magnesium powder and the content of Grignard compound is determined as follows:
1 ml of Grignard solution is quenched in a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl and extracted with ether. After drying over Na2SO4, a GC of the ether solution is recorded. In qualitative terms, it is observed that exclusively o-xylene has formed,
Quantitative determination of the content of the Grignard solution:
1 ml of Grignard solution is quenched with 2 ml of 0,1 M HCl and the excess acid is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. A suitable indicator is an aqueous 0,04% brornocresol solution. The colour change goes from yellow to blue. 0.74 ml of 0.1 M NaOH has been consumed. 2 ml-0.74 ml =1.26 ml, corresponding to 0.126 mmol of Grignard compound, Since a di-Grignard is present, the Grignard solution is 0.063 M. This is a yield exceeding 90%.
In a 250 ml three-neck flask with reflux condenser and magnetic stirrer, under argon, 1.8 g (8.66 mmol) of chlorophosphine (2-Py(tBu)PCI) are dissolved in 10 ml of THF and cooled to −60° C. Then 55 ml of the above-stipulated Grignard solution (0.063 M, 3.46 mmol) are slowly added dropwise at this temperature with a syringe pump. The solution at first remains clear and then turns intense yellow. After 1.5 hours, the solution turns cloudy. The mixture is left to warm up to room temperature overnight and a clear yellow solution is obtained. To complete the reaction, the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. After cooling, 1 ml of H2O is added and the solution loses colour and turns milky white. After removing THF under high vacuum, a stringy, pale yellow solid is obtained. 10 ml of water and 10 ml of ether are added thereto, and two homogeneous clear phases are obtained, which have good separability. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with ether. After the organic phase has been dried with Na2SO4, the ether is removed under high vacuum and a stringy, almost colourless solid is obtained. The latter is dissolved in 5 ml of MeOH while heating on a water bath and filtered through Celite. At −28° C., 772 mg of product are obtained in the form of white crystals overnight. (51%), After concentration, it was possible to isolate another 100 mg from the mother solution. The overall yield is 57.6%.
