Background of the invention
Protein tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the phosphate group on a protein substrate from ATP or GTP to a tyrosine residue. Receptor tyrosine kinase activates the secondary signaling pathway by phosphorylation caused by the transmission of signals from extracellular to intracellular. A variety of cellular processes are regulated by these signals, including proliferation, carbohydrate utilization, protein synthesis, angiogenesis, cell growth and cell survival. In addition, many diseases or conditions are associated with the abnormal, disorder or imbalance of one or more than one kinase(s).
Epidermal growth factor receptor belongs to the transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor ErbB family, the family includes EGFR (also known as ErbB or HER1), (HER2 or neu gene) of ErbB2, (HER3) of ErbB3 and ErbB4 (HER4), which all have tyrosine kinase activity except for HER3. The EGFR/ErbB family tyrosine kinase receptor has an indispensable role in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and thus becomes an effective target for preventing tumor growth and metastasis. The first generation of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), including Gefitinib (J Med 2004; 350: 2129-39) and Erlotinib (Lancet Oncol 2011; 12: 735-42), have been shown to be effective in patients with advanced NSCLC with somatic cell activation mutations. These mutations are in the kinase domain that encodes epidermal growth factor receptor, such as in-frame deletion of polynucleotide 19 exon and point mutation that the 858-position leucine on exon 21 is replaced by arginine (L858R) (Nat Rev Cancer 2007; 7: 169-81). However, after receiving the first generation of EGFR-TKIs, the patient will eventually be subject to a secondary growth of the tumor due to drug resistance. The secondary mutation that the 790-position threonine is replaced by methionine (T790M) is the most commonly recognized drug resistance mechanism for drug resistance. This mutation is detected in tumor cells of 50% to 60% patients with developed condition (N Engl J Med 2005; 353:207-8). The development of the second generation of EGFR-TKIs, such as Alfatinib (lancet oncol 2014; 15: 213-22) and Dacomitinib (Cancer 2014; 120: 1145-54), is used to overcome the resistance of the first generation of TKIs. They could irreversibly covalently bind to 797-position cysteine on EGFR. The covalent mechanism is believed to overcome the increased ATP affinity of the double mutant. However, cysteine-797 is present in all forms of EGFR. Thus, these second generation compounds are active not only for EGFR with active mutation and secondary mutation, but also for wild-type EGFR. Inhibition of wild-type EGFR is not considered to contribute to its clinical efficacy, but can lead to side effects of rash and diarrhea (Curr. Med. Chem. 2006, 13, 3483-3492).
Thus, the third generation of EGFR-TKIs includes AZD9291 (Cancer Discov 2014; 4: 1046-61), CO-1686 (Cancer Res. 2013; 19: 2240-2247) and HM61713 (US 2013011213), they are oral irreversible EGFR-TIKs with mutation selectivity, which can inhibit the mutation of T790M and the traditional EGFR, but do not have activity against wild-type EGFR. They are highly effective against T790M-positive tumors, but they still have some toxicity, such as diarrhea, rash, nausea and even high blood sugar and other clinical side effects (J Clin Oncol 2014;32:abstr 8009; J Clin Oncol 2014;32:abstr 8010). It is obvious that a compound with higher activity and lower toxicity will bring greater benefits.
The present invention relates to a series of novel fused or tricyclic aryl pyrimidine compounds, the series of compounds show excellent activity against EGFR with sensitive mutation and double mutation (sensitive and T790M resistant) and have a high selectivity for wild-type EGFR. They may provide more effective treatment for the diseases caused by abnormal enzymes of the epidermal growth factor receptor.

The prodrug of the compound described in the present invention is easily transformed to the compound of the present invention via chemical changes under physiological conditions. Besides, the prodrug can be transformed to the compound of the present invention via chemical or biochemical method in vivo environment.
Some compounds of the present invention can exist in the form of non-solvate or solvate forms, including hydrate forms. In general, the solvate form is similar to the non-solvate form, both of which are included within the scope of the present invention. Some compounds of the present invention exist in the form of polycrystalline or amorphous.
Some compounds of the present invention can contain asymmetric carbon atoms (optical center) or double bonds. The racemic isomers, diastereomers, geometric isomers and single isomers are included within the scope of the present invention.
The diagrammatic representation of the racemic isomer, the ambiscalemic and scalemic or the enantiopure compound of the present invention is from Maehr, J. Chem. Ed. 1985, 62: 114-120. Unless otherwise indicated, the absolute configuration of a stereocenter is represented by the wedge and dashed lines. When the compound of the present invention contains a vinyl double bond or other geometric asymmetric center, unless otherwise specified, E, Z geometric isomers are included. Similarly, all tautomeric forms are included within the scope of the present invention.
The compound of the present invention may exist as a specific geometric or stereoisomeric isomer. The present invention envisages all of this class of compounds, including cis- and trans-isomers, (-)- and (+)-antimers, (R)- and (S)-antimers, diastereomers, (D)-isomer, (L)-isomer, as well as racemic mixtures and other mixtures, such as enantiomers- or diastereoisomers-enriched mixtures, all of these mixtures are within the scope of the present invention. Additional asymmetric carbon atoms may exist in substituents such as in an alkyl. All of these isomers and their mixtures are included within the scope of the present invention.
Optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers, (D)- and (L)-isomers can be prepared by asymmetric synthesis or chiral reagents or other conventional techniques. If an enantiomer of a compound of the present invention is desired, asymmetric synthesis or derivatization action of the chiral auxiliaries can be employed in preparation, in which the resulting diastereomer mixtures are isolated, and the auxiliary groups are cleaved to provide the pure desired enantiomer. Or, when a molecule contains an alkaline functional group (such as amino) or an acidic functional group (such as carboxyl), a salt of diastereomer is formed with an appropriate optical active acid or alkali, and then the pure enantiomer can be recycled after resolution on the salt of diastereomer by fractional crystallization or chromatography which is known in the art. In addition, the separation of an enantiomer and a diastereomer is usually realized by the chromatographic method, the chromatography method employs a chiral stationary phase, and optionally combined with chemical derivatization method (e.g. an amine generates a carbamate).
One or more atoms constituting the compound of the present invention may comprise an unnatural proportion of atomic isotopes. For Example, the compound can be labeled by a radioactive isotope, such as tritium (3H), iodine-125(125I) or C-14(14C). All the variations in the isotopic composition of the compound disclosed in the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are included within the scope of the present invention.
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any formulation or carrier medium which is capable of delivering effective amount of the active substance disclosed in the present invention, does not interfere with the biological activity of the active substance, and is with no toxic side-effects on host or patient. Representative carrier includes water, oil, vegetables and minerals, cream base, lotion matrix, ointment matrix etc. The matrix comprises a suspension, a viscosity increaser, transdermal enhancers etc. Their formulations are well known to the person in cosmetic or topical drug art. Other information about the carrier can refer to Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (2005), the content of which is incorporated into this article as reference.
The term "excipient" usually refers to a carrier, diluent and/or medium required for the preparation of an effective pharmaceutical composition.
In terms of drug or pharmacological active agent, the term "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount" refers to enough quantity of the drug or formulation that can achieve desired effects but is with no toxicity. For the oral formulation of the present invention, "an effective amount" of one active substance in the composition is the amount required to achieve desired effects in combination with another active substance in the composition. The determination of the effective amount varies from person to person, which depends on the age and the general situation of the recipient, also on the specific active substance. In one case, an appropriate effective amount can be determined by the person skilled in the art according to conventional tests.
The term "active ingredient", "therapeutic agent", "active substance" or "active agent" refers to a chemical entity, which can effectively treat disorder, disease or condition of a target subject.
The term "substituted" refers to one or more hydrogen atoms in a specific atom optionally substituted by a substituent, including a deuterium and a variant of hydrogen, as long as the valence state of the specific atom is normal and the compound obtained after substitution is stable. When the substituent is a ketone group (i.e. =O), it means that two hydrogen atoms are substituted. A substitution of ketone group does not occur in an aryl. The term "optionally substituted" means that it may be substituted or not be substituted, unless otherwise specified, the type and number of substituents can be arbitrary under the premise of stability available in chemistry.
When any parameter (e.g. R) shows an occurrence for more than one time in the composition or structure of the compound, the definition of each occurrence is independent. Therefore, for example, if a group is substituted by 0 to 2 of R(s), the group may optionally be substituted by at most two R(s), and R has an independent option in each case. In addition, the combination of substituents and/or their variants is allowed only if such a combination will lead to a stable compound.
When one of the parameters is selected from a single bond, it indicates that the two groups which it is attached are directly connected, for example, when the L in A-L-Z represents a single bond, it indicates that the structure actually is A-Z.
When bonds of a substituent can be crossly connected to two atoms of a ring, the substituent can be bonded to arbitrary atoms in the ring. When the listed substituent does not specify through which atom it is connected to the general structure formula including the compound that is not specifically mentioned, the substituent can be bonded through any of its atoms. The combination of substituents and/or their variants is allowed only if such a combination will lead to a stable compound. For example, the structural unit<img> id-imgb0043.tif </img>represents that the connection can occur on any atom in the cyclohexyl or cyclohexadiene.

As an alternative, two substituents attached to adjacent atoms in an aryl or a heteroaryl ring can optionally be substituted by a substituent with a general formula as -A (CH2)r B-, wherein s and d is independently selected from an integer from 0 to 3, X is -O-, -NR', -S-, -S(O)-, -S(O)2- or -S(O)2NR'-. The substituent R, R', R" and R''' are respectively and preferably selected from hydrogen and substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6) alkyl.
Unless otherwise specified, the term "halogenated" or "halogen" itself or as a part of another substituent refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. In addition, the term "halogenated alkyl" is intended to include monohalogenated alkyl and polyhalogenated alkyl. For example, the term "halogenated (C1-C4)alkyl" is intended to include but not limited to trifluoromethyl, 2, 2, 2-trifluoroethyl, 4-chlorobutyl and 3-bromopropyl, etc.
Embodiments of halogenated alkyl include but not limited to trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, and pentachloroethyl.

Unless otherwise specified, the term "hetero" refers to a heteroatom or a heteroatomic group (i.e. a group containing a heteroatom), including atoms except for carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) and groups containing these heteroatoms, such as including oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), aluminum (Al), boron (B), -O-, -S-, =O, =S, -C(=O)O-, -C(=O)-, -C(=S)-, -S(=O), -S(=O)2-, and optionally substituted -C(=O)N(H)-, -N(H)-, -C(=NH)-, -S(=O)2N(H)- or -S(=O)N(H)-.
Unless otherwise specified, the "ring" refers to substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, heterocycloalkenyl, cycloalkynyl, heterocycloalkynyl, aryl or heteroaryl. The ring includes a single ring, a joint ring, a spiro ring, a fused ring or a bridged ring. A number of the atoms in the ring is usually defined as the member of the ring, for example, "5- to 7- membered ring" is a ring looped with 5 to 7 atoms. Unless otherwise specified, the ring optionally contains 1∼3 of heteroatoms.

Nitrogen and sulfur atoms can be optionally oxidized (i.e., NO and S(O)p). The nitrogen atom can be substituted or unsubstituted (i.e. N or NR, wherein R is H or other substituent that has been defined herein). The heterocycle can be attached to the side group of any heteroatom or carbon atom to form a stable structure. If the formed compound is stable, the heterocycle described herein can be substituted on its carbon or nitrogen atom. The nitrogen atom in the heterocycle is optionally quaternized. As a preferred embodiment of the present invention, when the total number of S and O atoms contained in the heterocycle exceeds 1, these heteroatoms are not adjacent to each other.

Pharmacodynamics Study in vivo
The following pharmacodynamics data in vivo showed that the compound of the present invention exhibited strong antitumor activity and reduced tumor volume in the NCD-H1975 non-small cell lung cancer patient-derived xenograft (CDX) model (BALB/c nude mice). For example, after 21 days of administration, the tumor volume of the representative compounds 30, 33, 34, 40, 42 and 43 decreased from the beginning of about 149 mm3 to 3-39 mm3.
The pharmacological experiments in vivo were performed on BALB/c nude mice that subcutaneously implanted NCI-H1975 lung cancer patient-derived xenograft (CDX).
BALB/c nude mice, female, 6-8 weeks, weighted about 18-22 grams, the mice were kept in a special pathogen-free environment, and in a single ventilation cage (5 mice per cage). The bedding and water of all the cages were disinfected before use. All animals were free to obtain standard certified commercial laboratory diets. A total of 100 mice were purchased from Beijing Vital for research. The tumor tissue (20-30 mm3) was implanted subcutaneously in the right ventricle of each mouse for tumor growth. The experiment was started when the average tumor volume reached about 150-200 mm3. The test compound was orally administered daily (compound 30 was administered at 10 mg/kg, compound 33, 34, 40, 42 and 43 were administered at 20 mg/kg and compound AZD9291 was administered continuously for 21 days at 5 mg/kg, the data were shown in Table 3). The tumor volume was measured twice a week with a two-dimensional caliper and the volume was measured in cubic millimeters and calculated by the following formula: V = V = 0.5 a × b2, where a and b were the major and minor diameters of the tumor, respectively. The antitumor efficacy was determined by dividing the average tumor size of the animals treated with the compound increased by the average tumor size of the untreated animals increased.

In this model, the less inhibitory effect on the tumor, the better the selectivity in vivo. For example, after 21 days of administration (20 mg/kg), the tumor volume of the representative compounds 17, 30, 37 and 38 (Experiment 1, the results were shown in Table 4) increased from about 175 mm3 to 1201-1434 mm3, while Afatinib (7.5 mg/kg) only increased to 479 mm3. After 21 days of administration (20 mg/kg), the tumor volume of representative compounds 33, 34 and 40 (experimental results, see Table 5) increased from at the beginning of about 144 mm3 to 1135-1708 mm3, and AZD9291 (5 mg/Kg) only increased to 321 mm3.
The selective experiments in vivo were performed on BALB/c nude mice that subcutaneously implanted human skin squamous cell A431 xenograft (CDX).
BALB/c nude mice, female, 6-8 weeks, weighted about 18-20 grams, the mice were kept in a special pathogen-free environment and in a single ventilation cage (5 mice per cage). The bedding and water of all the cages were disinfected before use. All animals were free to obtain standard certified commercial laboratory diets. All mice were purchased from mice of Shanghai BK Laboratory Animal Co., LTD for research. The tumor tissue (20-30 mm3) was implanted subcutaneously in the right ventricle of each mouse for tumor growth. The experiment was started when the average tumor volume reached about 150-200 mm3. The test compound was orally administered (compounds 17, 30, 37 and 38 were administered once daily at 20 mg/kg, the compound AZD9291 was administered once daily at 5 mg/kg, the compound CO-1686 was administered twice daily at 50 mg/kg, the compound Erlotinib was administered once daily at 75 mg/kg and the compound Afatinib was administered once daily at 7.5 mg/kg, 21 days of continuous administration. The data were shown in Table 4; compounds 33, 34, 40, 42 and 43 were administered once daily at 20 mg/kg and compound AZD9291 was administered once daily at5 mg/kg, 21 days of continuous administration. The data were shown in Table 5). The tumor volume was measured twice a week with a two-dimensional caliper and the volume was measured in cubic millimeters and calculated by the following formula: V = V = 0.5 a × b2, where a and b were the major and minor diameters of the tumor, respectively. The antitumor efficacy was determined by dividing the average tumor size of the animals treated with the compound increased by the average tumor size of the untreated animals increased.

The clinical data of EGFR TKIs showed that non-selective inhibition of wild-type EGFR has side effects, including rash and diarrhea; inhibition of insulin receptor (INSR) can lead to hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia. Tables 1 to 5 showed that many compounds not only had excellent activity and selectivity in vitro for L858R/EGFR T790M and EGFR790M, but also had good efficacy and selectivity in vivo, and the selectivity is manifested by the low inhibitory activity against wild-type EGFR (A431) and insulin receptor (INSR). These selective data in vitro, in vivo showed that the compounds will have better safety.
