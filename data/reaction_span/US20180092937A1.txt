FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel cyclic dinucleotide compounds (“CDNs”) of formula I, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, that feature the non-purine nucleobase imidazopyridazinone, one purine nucleobase and one non-canonical 2',5' phosphorothioate moiety and induce cytokine production. The present invention further relates to pharmaceutical compositions and combinations containing the compounds of the present invention, and to their medical use for the treatment of diseases associated with or modulated by STING (Stimulator of Interferon Genes). Particularly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for the therapy of inflammation, allergic and autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, cancer and as vaccine adjuvants.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The role of the immune system is to protect the body from pathogens and malignant cells. However, viruses and cancer cells find ways to evade the immune system. The aim of immunotherapies is thus to initiate an antigen specific immune response or to re-activate a pre-existing response in certain cell types of the immune system against the pathogenic invaders or cancerous cells.
The immune system consists of several specialized lineages which can be roughly grouped into two arms, the innate and the adaptive immune system. For a successful immune reaction lineages from both arms have to act in concert. A major role of the innate immune system is to mount a rapid immune response against pathogens or malignant cells which, unlike the adaptive system, is not antigen specific and long lasting. In addition to the direct killing of pathogens or transformed cells, the innate immune system also activates and subsequently directs the adaptive immune system. Antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells capture and present antigens in the form of a peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complex to T cells in lymphoid tissues. This antigen presentation together with the secretion of certain cytokines leads to the activation and differentiation of antigen specific effector CD4 and CD8 T cells. Type I interferon (IFN) production by antigen presenting cells, and other cell types, is considered a key event in the activation of T cells as the lack of type I IFN resulted in a reduced T cell dependent immune response against viral infections or tumor cells (Zitvogel et al, Nature Reviews Immunology 15, 405-414, 2015). On the other hand, the presence of a type I IFN signature during cancer therapy is associated with increased numbers of tumor infiltrating T cells and potentially favorable clinical outcome (Sistigu et al, Nature Medicine 20, 1301-1309, 2014).
Recent studies in mice have shown that efficient secretion of type I IFN in the tumor microenvironment and the induction of a T cell dependent immune response against cancer cells depends on the presence of the adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING, also known as Tmem173, MPYS, MITA, ERIS)(Woo et al, Immunity 41, 5, 830-842, 2014; Corrales et al, Cell Reports 11, 1018-1030, 2015; Deng et al, Immunity 41, 5, 843-852, 2014). The importance of the presence of type I IFN was highlighted by the fact that the deletion of STING resulted in reduced type I IFN levels in the tumor microenvironment and in a reduced anti-tumor effect in several tumor mouse models. On the other hand, the specific activation of STING resulted in an improved, antigen specific T cell immune response against cancer cells.
STING belongs to the family of nucleic acid sensors and is the adaptor for cytosolic DNA signaling. In its basal state STING exists as a dimer with its N terminal domain anchored in the ER and the C-terminal domain residing in the cytosol. Cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), generated by the protein cyclic GMP-AMP Synthase (cGAS) are the natural ligands of STING (Ablasser et al, Nature 498, 380-384, 2013). Binding of CDNs to STING induces conformational changes which allows the binding and activation of the TANK binding kinase (TBK1) and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and the relocalisation from the ER to perinuclear endosomes (Liu et al, Science 347, Issue 6227, 2630-1-2630-14, 2015). Phosphorylation of the transcription factor IRF3 and NF-kB by TBK1 results in expression of multiple cytokines including type I IFN.
Given the importance of type I IFN in several malignancies including viral infections and cancer therapy, strategies that allow the specific activation of STING is of therapeutic interest.

Pharmacological Activity
Compounds according to the present invention exhibit favorable binding affinity to human STING. The binding affinity can, for instance, be determined by scintillation proximity assay (SPA)-based competition binding assay as described in Nat. Chem. Biol. 10, 1043-1048 (2014). Alternatively, the binding affinity can, for instance, be determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) as described in Molecular Cell 51, 226-235 (2013). Alternatively, the binding affinity can, for instance, be determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) as described in WO 2016/145102. Alternatively, the binding affinity can be determined by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), for instance as described in WO 2016/145102.
Compounds according to the present invention exhibit favorable cellular activity. The in vitro cytokine induction can be measured in reporter cell lines, for instance in THP1 cells, in similar fashion as described in WO 2016/096174. Compounds according to the present invention exhibit favorable cellular activity in cells bearing different human STING alleles. Human STING exists in at least five known variants (WT, HAQ, REF/232H, AQ, Q/293 Q). To test the activity of the different CDNs on the human STING variants, THP1-STING KO cells can be stably transduced with vectors encoding for the different STING variants. Furthermore, the in vitro cytokine induction can be measured in human primary PBMCs or human dendritic cells.

Additionally, compounds according to the present invention exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. The PK properties can be determined in pre-clinical animal species, for example mouse, rat, hamster, dog, guinea pig, mini pig, cynomolgus monkey, rhesus monkey. The PK properties of a compound can be described, for example, by the following parameters: Mean residence time (MRT), elimination half-live (t1/2, i.e. the time required for the concentration of the drug to reach half of its original value), volume of distribution (VD, i.e. the apparent volume in which a drug is distributed), area under the curve (AUC, i.e. the integral of the concentration-time curve after a single dose), clearance (CL, i.e. the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time), as described in E. Kerns & L. Di (Drug-like properties: concepts, structure design and methods: from ADME to toxicity optimization, Elsevier, 1st ed, 2008).
Certain compounds according to the present invention exhibit favorable in vivo pharmacological activity, for instance in mouse MC38, 4T1, Colon26, EMT6 tumor models after intra-tumoral or intravenous application.
Favorable binding affinity in combination with favorable cellular activity and/or favorable cellular stability and/or improved PK properties can enable lower doses for pharmacological efficacy. Lower doses have the advantages of lower “drug load” or “drug burden” (parent drug and metabolites thereof) for the patient causing potentially less side effects, and lower production costs for the drug product.

The cellular activity of the compounds of the invention may be demonstrated using the following in vitro THP1 assay:
In Vitro Cytokine Induction
The cytokine-induction activities of compounds according to the present invention have been demonstrated by using a THP1 reporter cell line.
Activation of the STING protein expressed in cell lines results in an increase of interferon production. By the stable integration of an interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-inducible SEAP (secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase) reporter construct the functional interferon signaling pathway can be monitored. Using Invivogen's QUANTI-Blue™ colorimetric enzyme assay and a suitable optical density (OD) reader the activity of SEAP can be detected and quantified. This technique could be used to characterize pharmacological modification of the STING protein.
Measurements of SEAP activity were performed in THP1-Blue ISG cells stably expressing the human STING protein and the IRF-inducible SEAP reporter construct. Cells were cultivated for expansion in RPM11640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin, 100 μg/ml Zeocin, and 100 μg/ml Normocin in a 37°, 95% humidity and 5% CO2 incubator. Assay-ready cells were stored as frozen stocks In preparation for the assay, the cells thawed in Zeocin-/Normocin-free medium and were distributed into the assay plates with a density of 15000 cells/15 μL per well. Compounds were prepared by an 8 or 16 point serial dilution in 50% aqueous DMSO and a final dilution step into medium to ensure a final DMSO concentration of 0.5% in the assay. 5 μL of diluted compounds plus 5 μL medium were added to the plates, followed by a 24 hours incubation at 37° C.
At the day of the assay, 75 μl per well of Quanti-Blue reagent was added to all wells of the plate and the plate was incubated another 30 minutes at 37° C. The OD at 620 nm was measured on the EnVision reader (PerkinElmer).
EC50 values and Hill slopes were derived from 8- or 16-point four parametric non-linear curve fittings with the Megalab software (Boehringer Ingelheim) using the OD at 620 nM. The EC50 values for Example 1.1, Example 2.1, Example 3.1 and Example 4.1 are the mean of at least two measurements. See Table 2.

In the above THP1 assay, Example 1.1 is more potent than the respective diastereomeric Example 1.2. An X-Ray of Example 1.1 in complex with human STING indicates that both phosphor atoms have the Rp configuration. In analogous fashion it is thus assumed that the more potent respective diastereomers Example 2.1, Example 3.1, Example 4.1 also feature the Rp configuration at both phosphor atoms.
Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in the human STING gene that may affect the response to cyclic dinucleotides. To determine the activity of compounds of the invention, THP1-BLUE ISG reporter cell lines expressing the different human STING variants have been generated. To do so, the endogenous human STING was first deleted using the CRISPR/CAS9 system: THP1-Blue ISG cells were electroporated with ALL-IN-ONE CRISPR plasmids targeting the STING gene (purchased from Sigma encoding the gRNA and GFP as a reporter gene for successful transduction). GFP positive cells then were sorted 24 h post transfection and expanded. Cells were then dispersed in semisolid methocel medium to allow single cell clone isolations. Clones were then screened for cGAMP responsiveness using the Quanti-blue reporter assay. Non-responsive clones were subsequently analysed for STING loss by western blotting and sequencing of the STING locus.
For the overexpression of the human STING variants, a confirmed THP1-Blue ISG hSTING KO clone was transduced with individual retroviral plasmids (MSCV-ires-GFP-Blasti) encoding the allelic variants of hSTING (WT, HAQ, R232H, AQ and R293Q). Transduced cells were sorted for different levels of GFP fluorescence and STING allele expression was analysed by western blot. Populations expressing ectopic STING protein (WT, HAQ, R232H, AQ and R293Q) at comparable levels to endogenous STING levels form the parental, unmodified THP1-Blue ISG cell lines were selected and used for CDN characterization. Examples of the present invention exhibit cellular activity in all five of the above variants.
Cellular stability of compounds of the invention was measured as follows: The compound was dissolved in cell culture medium (MEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% non-essential amino acids and 1% pyruvate) to a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated with human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 (60000 cells/well in 24-well plate) for up to 24 h. Samples of the cell culture supernatants were taken at 1, 6, 24 h and quantified in LC-MS/MS.
The mouse PK of compounds of the invention was determined using the following method:

Accordingly, the present invention relates to compounds of general formula I as a medicament.
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a compound of general formula I or a pharmaceutical composition according to this invention for the treatment and/or prevention of diseases or conditions which can be influenced by the modulation of STING in a patient or of diseases or conditions associated with or modulated by STING in a patient. Preferably the patient is a human.
In yet another aspect the present invention relates to a method for treating a disease or condition associated with or modulated by STING in a mammal, in need of such treatment, that includes the step of administering to the mammal, preferably a human, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention.
Diseases and conditions which are associated with or modulated by, or can be influenced by the modulation of STING include inflammation, allergic or autoimmune diseases, for example allergic rhinitis or asthma, infectious diseases or cancer. Furthermore, due to their activity the compounds of the present invention are suitable as vaccine adjuvants.
Autoimmune diseases include, but are not limited to systemic lupus erythmatosus. Psoriasis, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), dermatomyositis and Sjogren's syndrome (SS).
Inflammation represents a group of vascular, cellular and neurological responses to trauma. Inflammation can be characterised as the movement of inflammatory cells such as monocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes into the tissues. This is usually associated with reduced endothelial barrier function and oedema into the tissues.
Inflammation can be classified as either acute or chronic. Acute inflammation is the initial response of the body to harmful stimuli and is achieved by the increased movement of plasma and leukocytes from the blood into the injured tissues. A cascade of biochemical event propagates and matures the inflammatory response, involving the local vascular system, the immune system, and various cells within the injured tissue. Prolonged inflammation, known as chronic inflammation, leads to a progressive shift in the type of cells which are present at the site of inflammation and is characterised by simultaneous destruction and healing of the tissue from the inflammatory process.
When occurring as part of an immune response to infection or as an acute response to trauma, inflammation can be beneficial and is normally self-limiting. However, inflammation can be detrimental under various conditions. This includes the production of excessive inflammation in response to infectious agents, which can lead to significant organ damage and death (for example, in the setting of sepsis).
Moreover, chronic inflammation is generally deleterious and is at the root of numerous chronic diseases, causing severe and irreversible damage to tissues. In such settings, the immune response is often directed against self-tissues (autoimmunity), although chronic responses to foreign entities can also lead to bystander damage to self-tissues. The aim of anti-inflammatory therapy is therefore to reduce this inflammation, to inhibit autoimmunity when present and to allow for the physiological process or healing and tissue repair to progress.

The carrier can be a bacterial cell that is transformed to express the polypeptide or to deliver a polynucleotide which is subsequently expressed in cells of the vaccinated individual. Adjuvants, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, can be added to increase the ability of the vaccine to trigger, enhance, or prolong an immune response. Additional materials, such as cytokines, chemokines, and bacterial nucleic acid sequences, like CpG, a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 agonist as well as additional agonists for TLR 2, TLR 4, TLR 5, TLR 7, TLR 8, TLR 9, including lipoprotein, LPS, monophosphoryl lipid A, lipoteichoic acid, imiquimod, resiquimod, and in addition retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) agonists such as poly I:C, used separately or in combination with the described compositions are also potential adjuvants. Other representative examples of adjuvants include the synthetic adjuvant QS-21 comprising a homogeneous saponin purified from the bark of Quillaja saponaria and Corynebacterium parvum (McCune et al., Cancer, 1979; 43:1619).
Methods for co-administration with an additional therapeutic agent are well known in the art (Hardman, et al. (eds.) (2001) Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 10th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y.; Poole and Peterson (eds.) (2001) Pharmacotherapeutics for Advanced Practice:A Practical Approach, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., Pa.; Chabner and Longo (eds.) (2001) Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy, Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, Phila., Pa.). Generally, co-administration or administration together indicates treating a subject with two or more agents, where the agents can be administered simultaneously or at different times. For example, such agents may be delivered to a single subject as separate administrations, which may be at essentially the same time or different times, and which may be by the same route or different routes of administration. Such agents may be delivered to a single subject in the same administration (e.g. same formulation) such that they are administered at the same time by the same route of administration.
Because of the adjuvant properties of the compounds of the present invention, their use may also combined with other therapeutic modalities including other vaccines, adjuvants, antigen, antibodies, and immune modulators. Examples are provided below.
Adjuvants
In addition to the compounds of the present invention and compositions thereof described herein, the compositions or methods of the present invention may further comprise one or more additional substances which, because of their nature, can act to stimulate or otherwise utilize the immune system to respond to the cancer antigens present on the targeted tumor cell(s). Such adjuvants include, but are not limited to, lipids, liposomes, inactivated bacteria which induce innate immunity (e.g., inactivated or attenuated Listeria monocytogenes), compositions which mediate innate immune activation via Toll-like Receptors (TLRs), (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), Retinoic acid inducible gene-based (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) and/or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (“PAMPS”). Examples of PAMPs include lipoproteins, lipopolypeptides, peptidoglycans, zymosan, lipopolysaccharide, neisserial porins, flagellin, profillin, galactoceramide, muramyl dipeptide. Peptidoglycans, lipoproteins, and lipoteichoic acids are cell wall components of Gram-positive. Lipopolysaccharides are expressed by most bacteria, with MPL being one example. Flagellin refers to the structural component of bacterial flagella that is secreted bypathogenic and commensal bacterial. Galactosylceramide is an activator of natural killer T (NKT) cells. Muramyl dipeptide is a bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria.
Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, such as an immune checkpoint inhibitor selected from the group consisting of a CTLA-4 pathway antagonist, a PD-1 pathway antagonist, a Tim-3 pathway antagonist, a Vista pathway antagonist, a BTLA pathway antagonist, a LAG-3 pathway antagonist, or a TIGIT pathway antagonist. In some embodiments, the immune checkpoint inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, an anti-PD-1 antibody, an anti-Tim-3 antibody, an anti-Vista antibody, an anti-BTLA antibody, an anti-LAG-3 antibody, or an anti-TIGIT antibody.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with CTLA-4 pathway antagonists. In some embodiments, the combination is used to treat a solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy. CTLA-4 is thought to be an important negative regulator of the adaptive immune response. Activated T cells upregulate CTLA-4, which binds CD80 and CD86 on antigen-presenting cells with higher affinity than CD28, thus inhibiting T-cell stimulation, IL-2 gene expression and T-cell proliferation. Anti-tumor effects of CTLA4 blockade have been observed in murine models of colon carcinoma, metastatic prostate cancer, and metastatic melanoma. In some embodiments, the CTLA-4 pathway antogonist is an anti-CTLA-4 antibody molecule selected from the group consisting of tremelimumab and ipilimumab.
Ipilimumab (a CTLA-4 antibody, also known as MDX-010, CAS No. 477202-00-9) and tremelimumab (IgG2 monoclonal antibody formerly known as ticilimumab, CP-675,206) are humanized monoclonal antibodies that bind to human CTLA4 and prevent its interaction with CD80 and CD86. Other negative immune regulators which may be targeted by a similar strategy include programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), B and T lymphocyte attenuator, transforming growth factor beta, interleukin-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor.
In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with an anti-CTLA-4 antibody and an anti-PD-1 antibody. In one embodiment, the combination includes an anti-PD-1 antibody molecule, e.g., as described herein, and an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, e.g., ipilimumab. Exemplary doses that can be use include a dose of anti-PD-1 antibody molecule of about 1 to 10 mg/kg, e.g., 3 mg/kg, and a dose of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, e.g., ipilimumab, of about 3 mg/kg.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with PD-1 pathway antagonists. In some embodiments, the combination is used to treat a solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy. PD-1 is another negative regulator of adaptive immune response that is expressed on activated T-cells. PD-1 binds to B7-H1 and B7-DC, and the engagement of PD-1 suppresses T-cell activation. Antitumor effects have been demonstrated with PD-1 pathway blockade. Anti-PD-1 antibody molecules (e.g. Nivolumab (Opdivo®), pembrolizumab (Keytruda®), and pidilizumab), and AMP-224 have been reported in the literature to be examples of PD-1 pathway blockers which may find use in the present invention. In some embodiments, the PD-1 pathway antogonist is an anti-PD-1 antibody molecule selected from the group consisting of nivolumab, pembrolizumab or pidilizumab.
In some embodiments the PD-1 pathway antagonist is an immunoadhesin (e.g., an immunoadhesin comprising an extracellular or PD-1 binding portion of PD-LI or PD-L2 fused to a constant region (e.g., an Fc region of an immunoglobulin sequence). In some embodiments, the PD-1 inhibitor is AMP-224 (B7-DCIg; Amplimmune; e.g., disclosed in WO2010/027827 and WO2011/066342) is a PD-L2 Fc fusion soluble receptor that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and B7-H1.
In some embodiments the PD-1 pathway antagonist is a PD-L1 or PD-L2 inhibitor. In some embodiments the PD-L1 or PD-L2 inhibitor is an anti-PD-L1 antibody or an anti-PD-L2 antibody. In some embodiments, the anti-PD-LI inhibitor is chosen from YW243.55.S70, MPDL3280A, MEDI-4736, MSB-0010718C, or MDX-1105. In some embodiments, the PD-L1 inhibitor is an anti-PD-L1 antibody MSB0010718C. MSB0010718C (also referred to as A09-246-2; Merck Serono) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with TIM-3 pathway antagonists. In some embodiments, the combination is used to treat a solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy. In some embodiments, the TIM-3 pathway antagonist is an anti-TIM-3 antibody. In some embodiments, anti-TIM-3 antibody molecules are disclosed in US 2015/0218274, published on Aug. 6, 2015, entitled “Antibody Molecules to TIM-3 and Uses Thereof”.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with LAG-3 pathway antagonists. In some embodiments, the combination is used to treat a solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy. In some embodiments, the LAG-3 pathway antagonist is an anti-LAG-3 antibody. In some embodiments the anti-LAG-3 antibody molecules are disclosed in US 2015/0259420, filed Mar. 13, 2015, entitled “Antibody Molecules to LAG-3 and Uses Thereof”.
Amino Acid Catabolism
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with an amino acid metabolism inhibitor such as an IDO or Arginase1 or Arginase2 inhibitor to antagonise the immune inhibitory effect of immune suppressive immune cells such as myeloid derived suppressor cells.
Purinergic Signalling Pathway
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with inhibitors of the purinergic signalling pathway such as CD39 and CD73 pathway antagonists or A2A/A2B receptors inhibitors.
Chemokines and Chemokine Receptors
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with chemokine or chemokine receptor antagonist to inhibit the recruitment of suppressive immune cells into the tumor microenvironment. For example, but not exclusively, the compounds of the present invention can be used in combination of CCR2 or CCR5 antagonist the reduce the infiltration of myeloid suppressor cells and regultory T cells.
T-Cell Receptor Agonists
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with a T-cell receptor agonist, such as a CD28 agonist, an OX40 agonist, a GITR agonist, a CD137 agonist, a CD27 agonist or an HVEM agonist.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with a CD27 agonist. Exemplary CD27 agonists include an anti-CD27 agonistic antibody, e.g. as described in PCT Publication No. WO 2012/004367.
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with a GITR agonist. In some embodiments, the combination is used to treat a solid tumor or a hematologic malignancy. Exemplary GITR agonists include, e.g., GITR fusion proteins and anti-GITR antibodies (e.g., bivalent anti-GITR antibodies).
TLR Agonists
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with a Toll like receptor agonist. The term “Toll like receptor” (or “TLR”) as used herein refers to a member of the Toll-like receptor family of proteins or a fragment thereof that senses a microbial product and/or initiates an adaptive immune response. In one embodiment, a TLR activates a dendritic cell (DC). Toll like receptors (TLRs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors that were initially identified as sensors of the innate immune system that recognize microbial pathogens. TLRs comprise a family of conserved membrane spanning molecules containing an ectodomain of leucine-rich repeats, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular TIR (Toll/IL-1R) domain. TLRs recognize distinct structures in microbes, often referred to as “PAMPs” (pathogen associated molecular patterns). Ligand binding to TLRs invokes a cascade of intra-cellular signaling pathways that induce the production of factors involved in inflammation and immunity.
TLR agonists known in the art and finding use in the present invention include, but are not limited to, the following:Pam3Cys, a TLR-1/2 agonist;CFA, a TLR-2 agonist;MALP2, a TLR-2 agonist;Pam2Cys, a TLR-2 agonist;FSL-1, a TLR-2 agonist;Hib-OMPC, a TLR-2 agonist;polyribosinic:polyribocytidic acid (Poly I:C), a TLR-3 agonist;polyadenosine-polyuridylic acid (poly AU), a TLR-3 agonist;Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic acid stabilized with poly-L-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose(Hiltonol®), a TLR-3 agonist;monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a TLR-4 agonist;LPS, a TLR-4 agonist;bacterial flagellin, a TLR-5 agonist;sialyl-Tn (STn), a carbohydrate associated with the MUC1 mucin on a number of humancancer cells and a TLR-4 agonist;imiquimod, a TLR-7 agonist;resiquimod, a TLR-7/8 agonist;loxoribine, a TLR-7/8 agonist; andunmethylated CpG dinucleotide (CpG-ODN), a TLR-9 agonist.
Because of their adjuvant qualities, TLR agonists are preferably used in combinations with other vaccines, adjuvants and/or immune modulators, and may be combined in various combinations. Thus, in certain embodiments, the mono- or di-FCDN compounds that bind to STING and induce STING-dependent TBK1 activation and an inactivated tumor cell which expresses and secretes one or more cytokines which stimulate dendritic cell induction, recruitment and/or maturation, as described herein can be administered together with one or more TLR agonists for therapeutic purposes.
Antibody Therapeutics
The compounds of the present invention can be used in combination with therapeutic antibodies. In some embodiments, the mechanism of action of the therapeutic antibody is Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC). ADCC is a mechanism of cell-mediated immune defense whereby an effector cell of the immune system actively lyses a target cell, whose membrane-surface antigens have been bound by specific antibodies. It is one of the mechanisms through which antibodies, as part of the humoral immune response, can act to limit and contain infection. Classical ADCC is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells; macrophages, neutrophils and eosinophils can also mediate ADCC. ADCC is an important mechanism of action of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, including trastuzumab and rituximab, against tumors. Compounds of the present invention may act to potentiate ADCC.
The following are an exemplary list of antibodies which may be used together with the compounds of the present invention:Muromonab-CD3, Infliximab, adalimumab, Omalizumab, Daclizumab, Rituximab, Ibritumomab, Tositumomab, Cetuximab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab, Lym-1 Ipilimumab, Vitaxin, Bevacizumab and Abciximab.
Additional therapeutic antibodies that may be used in combination with the compounds of the present invention include a prolactin receptor (PRLR) inhibitor, a HER3 inhibitor, an EGFR2 and/or EGFR4 inhibitor, an M-CSF inhibitor, an anti-APRIL antibody, or an anti-SIRPα or anti-CD47 antibody.

Synthesis of Compounds According to the Present Invention
General Technical Remarks
The terms “ambient temperature” and “room temperature” are used interchangeably and designate a temperature of about 20° C., e.g. 15 to 25° C.
As a rule, 1H NMR spectra and/or mass spectra have been obtained of the compounds prepared. Unless otherwise stated, all chromatographic operations were performed at room temperature. During cyclic dinucleotide synthesis, evaporation of solvents was typically performed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure with water bath temperatures not exceeding 35° C. Furthermore, during cyclic dinucleotide synthesis, reactions were performed under nitrogen or argon.
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra: For 1H spectra, chemical shifts were referenced to the DMSO solvent signal (2.50 ppm) or, for measurements in D2O, to DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid). The 31P NMR spectra were indirectly referenced by comparison of the absolute frequencies of 1H/31P (Bruker BioSpin GmbH, Software: TopSpin, au program: xsi). All 31P NMR spectra were recorded with proton decoupling.

EXAMPLE 1.1 and EXAMPLE 1.2;
EXAMPLE 2.1 and EXAMPLE 2.2;
EXAMPLE 3.1 and EXAMPLE 3.2;
EXAMPLE 4.1 and EXAMPLE 4.2.
Example 1.1 and Example 1.2
Cyclic (imidazopyridazinon-β-D-ribofuranoside-(2'→5')-phosphorothioate-adenosine-(3'→5')-phosphorothioate)
<img> id-US20180092937A1-20180405-C00035.TIF </img>
30 mL anhydrous pyridine and 15 mL anhydrous triethylamine were added to crude 3'-TBS-imidazopyridazinon-3-D-ribofuranoside-(2'→5')-phosphorothioate-2'-TBS-adenosine-(3'→5')-phosphorothioate (INTERMEDIATE 1.8; 0.76 g). The resulting solution was concentrated under reduced pressure to approximately 5 mL total volume, followed by simultaneous addition of triethylamine trihydrofluoride (3.590 mL, 21.7 mmol) and 11 mL anhydrous triethylamine. This solution was stirred at 50° C. for 3.5 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was quenched with methoxytrimethylsilane (10 mL, 72.4 mmol) and further stirred at room temperature to consume any excess of HF. After 30 minutes, all volatile components were evaporated under reduced pressure, followed by a final co-evaporation with 50 mL anhydrous toluene under reduced pressure. The residue was further dried in vacuo to yield the raw mixture containing Example 1.1 and Example 1.2.
65 mL water was added and the resulting suspension was placed in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature. After 15 minutes, this suspension was poured into 60 mL chloroform and the organic phase was separated. This extraction was repeated another two times with chloroform. The combined organic phases were extracted with 50 mL water and the combined product-containing aqueous phase was filtered with a 0.45 μm Rotilabo®-CME-syringe filter (outer diameter: 33 mm) to remove particulate components. The product solution was diluted with water to 500 mL and applied to a Q Sepharose™ Fast Flow anion exchange column (40-165 μm; 125×35 mm; 120 mL) Cl−-form, previously regenerated with 2 M sodium chloride and washed with water. The column was washed with water (2 column volumes), followed by a gradient of 0-1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB, pH 7) in water over column volumes (detection wavelength 254 nm). EXAMPLE 1.1 and EXAMPLE 1.2 eluted as mixture of isomers with ˜0.6 M TEAB. Product-containing fractions were carefully concentrated to a final volume of approximately 10 mL under reduced pressure.
Separation of EXAMPLE 1.1 (fourth eluting) and EXAMPLE 1.2 (third eluting) was accomplished by repeated semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC purifications. The product solution was applied to a YMC*GEL ODS-A 12 nm column (10 μm; 250×16 mm; ˜50 mL), previously equilibrated with 4% acetonitrile, 20 mM triethyammonium formate (TEAF, pH 6.8) in water. Elution was performed with a step-gradient of 4%, 6% and 20% acetonitrile, 20 mM TEAF (pH 6.8) in water
Preparation of Example 1.1, Sodium Salt (“Fourth Eluting Diastereomer”)
Desalting of EXAMPLE 1.1, TEA-salt was performed by preparative reversed phase medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC). The product solution (˜40 mL) was applied to a Merck LiChroprep®RP-18 column (15-25 μm; 450×25 mm; ˜220 mL), previously equilibrated with water. The column was washed with water to remove excess TEAF buffer. Afterwards, 2% 2-propanol in water was used to elute the desalted EXAMPLE 1.1. Product-containing fractions were partially concentrated under reduced pressure and subsequently applied to a SP Sepharose™ Fast Flow cation exchange column (45-165 μm; 125×35 mm; 120 mL) Na+-form, previously regenerated with 2 M sodium chloride and washed with water. The column was washed with water until no UV-absorbance was detectable anymore (detection wavelength 254 nm). Product-containing fractions were carefully evaporated under reduced pressure and additionally dried in vacuo to yield EXAMPLE 1.1 as disodium salt.

16 mg (19 μmol) of INTERMEDIATE 2.4-d were added to 1 mL anhydrous pyridine and 4 mL anhydrous acetonitrile and the solvent was azeotropically evaporated in vacuo. The residue was twice re-suspended in 10 mL anhydrous acetonitrile and again azeotropically evaporated in vacuo. 80.7 μL (1.0 mmol) anhydrous pyridine and 168 μL (1.2 μmol) TEA were added to the residue before 103 μL (0.63 mmol) TEA*3HF were cautiously added via a syringe. The resulting mixture was stirred at 50° C. for 90 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was quenched by the addition of 20 mL of an aq. solution of triethylammonium carbonate (conc.=1 mol/L). The resulting mixture was stirred for further 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was carefully loaded on a Water Sep Pak C18© cartridge (5 g C18-material, preconditioned with first 25 mL acetonitrile and afterwards with 25 mL water) and washed with 60 mL of water. Afterwards the product was eluted from the cartridge by using 100 mL of a acetonitrile/triethylammonium acetat/water mixture (prepared by adding 1 mL of an aq. triethylammonium acetat solution (conc=1 mol/L) to 100 mL water and 25 mL acetonitrile). Fractions containing product were combined and the solvent was removed by lyophilization. The resulting product was further purified by prep. HPLC (Atlantis C18; 20 mM aq. NH4OAc/acetonitrile=98/2→80/20.). After the solvent were removed by freeze drying the product was dissolved in 2 mL water and poured on a Bio-Rad Spin column (filled with 250 mg BT AG 50W-2 resin 100-200 Mesh hydrogen Form, conditioned with 3 mL 1M aq. NaOH and afterwards washed with 6 mL water resulting in pH˜7)) and eluted with 12 mL water. Fractions containing the final product were combined and the solvent was removed by freeze drying.
