As used herein, when a definition is not otherwise provided, “hetero” refers to one including one to three heteroatoms selected from N, O, S, P, and Si, and remaining carbons in one functional group.
According to one embodiment, a compound for an organic optoelectronic device is represented by Chemical Formula 1.
In Chemical Formula 1,
R1 to R5 are independently hydrogen, deuterium, -NH2, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C30 alkylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C30 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 heteroaryl group, or a combination thereof,
at least one of R2, R4, and R5 is a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, or a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 heteroaryl group,
each of a, c, d, e, and f are an integer of 1 to 4, and
b is an integer of 1 or 2.
The compound may include spiro[9H-fluorene-9,15'-[15H]indeno[2,1-g]chrysene] formed by fusing chrysene and spirofluorene as a core structure. In the core structure, the chrysene and the spirofluorene are three-dimensionally overlapped with each other. When the spirofluorene is present in this way, a fluorene moiety may be twisted at an angle of about 90° and thus prevents packing of molecules and suppresses formation of an excimer during formation of a thin film.
In Chemical Formula 1, at least one R4 and at least one R5 may be selected from a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 heteroaryl group, and a combination thereof. At least one o R4 and at least one R5 may be present at position Nos. 2 and 7 (meta positions) of the fluorine forming the spiro structure.
In Chemical Formula 1, at least one R2 and at least one R5 may be selected from a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 heteroaryl group, and a combination thereof. At least R2 may be present at a position No. 12 (a meta position) of the chrysene, and at least one R5 may be present at a position No. 2 or 7 (meta positions) of the fluorine forming the spiro structure.
Examples of the C2 to C30 heteroaryl group may be carbazole, phenothiazine, phenoxazine, acridine, triazine, and the like.
In Chemical Formula 1, the combination indicates that the substituents are connected with each other and thus form a fused ring or are linked by a single bond or through methylene.
Specific examples of the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 may be compounds of Chemical Formulae A-1 to E-15.
The compound may have a maximum absorption wavelength of about 380 nm to about 460 nm, for example about 395 nm to about 454 nm.
The compound may have a bandgap of about 2.2 eV to about 3.0 eV, for example about 2.3 eV to about 2.9 eV.
When at least one of R1 to R5 is selected from a substituted or unsubstituted C1 to C30 alkylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 N-containing a heteroaryl group, and a combination thereof, the compound includes an electron donor functional group and an electron acceptor functional group in one molecule and may balance moving of holes and electrons and efficiently form excitons. This compound having bipolar characteristics may well trap the holes and the electrons and facilitate generation of the excitons in an emission layer and thus improve efficiency of an organic optoelectronic device.
In Chemical Formula 1, because at least one of R2, R4, and R5 is a aromatic substituent of a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6 to C30 arylamine group, or a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C30 heteroaryl group, thermal stability is more improved compared with when R2, R4, and R5 are hydrogen or an aliphatic substituent. Accordingly, the compound may secure excellent film-forming workability and stably maintain efficiency of a photoelectronic device in a subsequent process.
In addition, the compound may not have a planar structure but a three-dimensional core structure and thus prevents packing of molecules and resultantly improves efficiency of an organic optoelectronic device.
The compound may be applied to various organic optoelectronic devices, for example, may be used as a host. This compound may be obtained in a dry process such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method or in a solution process.
Hereinafter, an organic optoelectronic device manufactured by using the compound is described.
The organic optoelectronic device may be any device that converts electrical energy into photoenergy and vice versa without particular limitation, and may be, for example, an organic photoelectric device, an organic light emitting diode, and an organic solar cell.
The organic optoelectronic device includes an anode and a cathode facing each other, and at least one organic layer between the anode and the cathode, wherein the organic layer includes the compound.
Herein, an organic light emitting diode as one example of an organic optoelectronic device is described referring to drawings.

One of the first electrode 110 and the second electrode 120 is a cathode and the other is an anode.
At least one of the first electrode 110 and the second electrode 120 may be a transparent electrode. For example, when the first electrode 110 is a transparent electrode, the organic light emitting diode 100 may be a bottom emission type in which light is emitted toward the first electrode 110, while when the second electrode 120 is a transparent electrode, the organic light emitting diode 100 may be a top emission type in which light is emitted toward the second electrode 120.
