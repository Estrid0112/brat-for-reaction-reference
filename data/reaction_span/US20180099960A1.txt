FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to novel deuterated and non-deuterated cyclic chemical compounds and salts thereof, to methods of using such compounds in treating protein kinase-mediated diseases or conditions such as autoimmune and cancer diseases or conditions, to pharmaceutical compositions of said compounds, and to combination treatments of said compounds with co-administered therapeutic agents.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The information provided herein is intended solely to assist the understanding of the reader. None of the information provided nor references cited is admitted to be prior art to the present invention.
The identification of the molecular events that underlie the development of human diseases presents a major challenge in the design of improved strategies in the prevention, management, and cure of certain diseases (Lahiry P et al. Kinase mutations in human disease: interpreting genotype-phenotype relationships. Nat Rev Genet. 2010; 11(1):60-74).
The role of aberrantly regulated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in human diseases is the subject of intense investigation (Lahiry id.). Protein kinases are regulators of cellular signaling, and their functional dysregulation is common in carcinogenesis, autoimmune reactions, and many other disease states or conditions (Lahiry id.; Vargas L et al. Inhibitors of BTK and ITK: state of the new drugs for cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory diseases. Scand J Immunol. 2013; 78(2):130-9; Nobel M E et al. Protein kinase inhibitors: insights into drug design from structure. Science. 2004; 303:1800-1805). The human genome encodes over 500 protein kinases that share a catalytic domain conserved in sequence and structure but which are notably different in how their catalysis is regulated (Manning G et al. The protein kinase complement of the human genome. Science. 2002; 298:1912-1934; Nobel id.). Protein kinases regulate key signal transduction cascades that control or are involved in the control of physiological functions, including cellular growth and proliferation, cell differentiation, cellular development, cell division, stress response, transcription regulation, aberrant mitogenesis, angiogenesis, abnormal endothelial cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions during vascular development, inflammation, Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signal transduction, and several other cellular processes (Manning id). Protein kinase inhibitors have been established as promising drugs that inhibit overactive protein kinases in cancer cells (Gross S et al. Targeting cancer with kinase inhibitors. J Clin Invest. 2015; 125(5):1780-1789; Vargas id).
A partial, non-limiting list of kinases includes: ABL, ACK, ARG, BLK, BMX, BRK, BTK, CSK, DDR1, DDR2, EGFR, EPHA1, FGR, FMS, FRK, FYN(isoform a), FYN(isoform b), HCK, KIT, LCK, LYNa, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, SRC, SRM, YES, PIK3CA/PIK3R1 (Manning id). Aberrant kinase activity has been observed in many disease states including benign and malignant proliferative conditions as well as diseases resulting from inappropriate activation of the immune and nervous systems.
The novel compounds of this invention inhibit the activity of one or more protein kinases and are expected to be useful in treating kinase-related diseases or conditions.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
As used herein the following definitions apply unless clearly indicated otherwise. By “chemical structure” or “chemical substructure” is meant any definable atom or group of atoms that constitute an individually identifiable molecule, portion of a molecule, such as a substituent moiety, a core which is optionally substituted, and the like. Normally, chemical substructures of a ligand can have a role in binding of the ligand to a target molecule, or can influence the three-dimensional shape, electrostatic charge, and/or conformational properties of the ligand.
The term “prodrug” is a compound that, upon in vivo administration, is metabolized by one or more steps or processes or otherwise converted to the biologically, pharmaceutically, or therapeutically active form of the compound. To produce a prodrug, the pharmaceutically active compound is modified such that the active compound will be regenerated by metabolic or hydrolytic processes.
The term “binds,” in connection with the interaction between a target and a potential binding compound, indicates that the potential binding compound associates with the target to a statistically significant degree as compared to association with proteins generally (i.e., non-specific binding).
As used herein, the term “modulating” or “modulate” refers to an effect of altering a biological activity, especially a biological activity associated with a particular biomolecule such as a protein kinase. For example, an agonist or antagonist of a particular biomolecule modulates the activity of that biomolecule, e.g., an enzyme, by either increasing (e.g., agonist, activator), or decreasing (e.g., antagonist, inhibitor) its activity. This type of activity is typically indicated in terms of an half maximal effective concentration (EC50) or half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for an activator or inhibitor, respectively. Additionally, inhibition activity can be expressed in percent inhibition and/or Ki.
As used herein in connection with compounds of the invention, the term “synthesizing” and like terms means chemical synthesis from one or more precursor materials. Further, by “assaying” is meant the creation of experimental conditions and the gathering of data regarding a particular result of the experimental conditions. For example, enzymes can be assayed based on their ability to act upon a detectable substrate. A compound or ligand can be assayed based on its ability to bind to a particular target molecule or molecules.
“D,” “d,” and “2H” refer to a deuterium atom, a stable isotope of hydrogen with a mass twice that of hydrogen (atomic weight of 2.0144). Hydrogen naturally occurs as a mixture of the isotopes hydrogen (1H), deuterium (2H or D), and tritium (3H or T). The natural abundance of deuterium is about 0.015%. A person skilled in the art would recognize that all chemical compounds with a hydrogen atom actually are present as mixtures of the H and D isotopes, with about 0.015% being the deuterium isotope. Compounds with a level of deuterium that has been enriched to be greater than its natural abundance of 0.015% should be considered unnatural, and as a result novel, over their non-enriched counterparts. The D in structural formulas and chemical compounds herein refers to incorporation of D in amounts greater than 0.015%.
The term “lower alkyl” is art-recognized, and includes saturated aliphatic groups, including straight-chain alkyl groups and branched-chain alkyl groups. In certain embodiments, a straight chain or branched chain alkyl has about 6 or fewer carbon atoms in its backbone (e.g., C1-C6 for straight chain, C3-C6 for branched chain).
The term “lower alkenyl” refers to an unsaturated straight or branched hydrocarbon having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, such as straight or branched group of 2-6 carbon atoms, referred to herein as C2-C6 alkenyl.
The term “cycloalkyl” refers to a 3-7 membered moncyclic ring of aliphatic groups, including C3-C7, that is optionally substituted with alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxyl, optionally substituted amino, halogens, cyano (-CN), or nitro (-NO2).
The terms “alkoxyl” or “alkoxy” are art-recognized and refer to an alkyl group, as defined above, having an oxygen radical attached thereto. Representative alkoxyl groups include methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, tert-butoxy, and the like.
The terms “heterocyclo,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocycle” refer to fully saturated or unsaturated, including non-aromatic (i.e., “heterocycloalkyl”) and aromatic (i.e., “heteroaryl”) cyclic groups having from 5 to 10 atoms withat least one heteroatom (e.g. oxygen (“O”), sulfur (“S”), or nitrogen (“N”)) in at least one carbon atom-containing ring. Each ring of the heterocyclic group may have 1, 2, 3, or 4 heteroatoms. The heteroatoms nitrogen and sulfur may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. Further, the heterocyclo may be optionally substituted with amino (-NR5R6), wherein R5 and R6 are independently hydrogen and/or lower alkyl, hydroxyl (-OH), alkoxyl, lower alkyl or lower alkenyl, wherein the lower alkyl or lower alkenyl may be optionally substituted with -OH or alkoxyl groups.
“Halogen” refers to chloro (“Cl”), fluoro (“F”), bromo (“Br”), or iodo (“I”).
It is to be understood that the compounds provided herein may contain chiral centers. Such chiral centers may be of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or may be a mixture thereof. Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enantiomerically pure, or stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures (about 50:50 ratio of enantiomers).
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means that the indicated material does not have properties that would cause a reasonably prudent medical practitioner to avoid administration of the material to a patient, taking into consideration the disease or condition to be treated and the respective route of administration. For example, it is commonly required that such a material be essentially sterile, e.g., for injectable.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts that are non-toxic in the amounts and concentrations at which they are administered. The preparation of such salts can facilitate the pharmacological use by altering the physical characteristics of a compound without preventing it from exerting its physiological effect.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable composition” refers to a pharmaceutically active compound and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, excipients, and/or diluents.
The term “therapeutically effective” or “effective amount” is an amount of a preparation that alone, or together with further doses, and/or in combination with other therapeutic agents produces the desired response. This may involve halting the progression of the disease or delaying the onset of or preventing the disease or condition from occurring, although it may also imply only slowing of the disease or condition temporarily.
The term “protein kinase-mediated disease or condition” refers to a disease or condition in which the biological function of a protein kinase affects the development, course, and/or symptoms of the disease or condition.
The term “mutants” refers to single or multiple amino acid changes in a protein as compared to the wild-type protein amino acid sequence.
Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the word “comprise” and variations of the word, such as “comprising” and “comprises,” means “including but not limited to,” and is not intended to exclude, for example, other additives, components, integers, or steps.

Protein Kinase Targets and Indications of the Invention
Protein kinases play key roles in propagating biochemical signals in diverse biological pathways. As such, kinases represent important control points for small molecule therapeutic intervention. More than 500 kinases have been described, and specific kinases have been implicated in a wide range of diseases or conditions. In one aspect, the invention provides methods for treating a protein kinase-mediated disease or condition in an animal or human subject, (i.e., indications), such as without limitation, autoimmune disease, hyperproliferative disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory disease, neurological disease, and other diseases.
Preferably, the protein kinase-mediated disease or condition is an autoimmune disease or cancer. More preferably, the autoimmune disease is at least one of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), transplant rejection, multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and psoriasis; and the cancer is at least one of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphomas, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), T-cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma.

A number of different assays for kinase activity can be utilized for testing to determine active modulators and/or determining specificity of a modulator for a particular kinase or group of kinases. In addition to the assay mentioned in the Examples below, the person of ordinary skill in the art will know and understand that other assays that can be utilized or can be modified for a particular application.
In a commonly used in vitro screen for measuring inhibition of a battery of selected protein kinases (see Example 15) including ABL, ABL(E255K), ACK, ARG, BLK, BMX, BRK, BTK, CSK, DDR1, DDR2, EGFR, EPHA1, FGR, FMS, FRK, FYN, HCK, KIT, LCK, LYN, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, SRC, SRM, YES, and PIK3CA/PIK3R1, compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII were found to display potent activity to inhibit BTK, BMX, ABL, ABL(E255K), SRC, ACK, ARG, BLK, DDR2, EPHA, FGR, FMS, FRK, FYN, HCK, LCK, LYN, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, YES, and PIK3CA/PIK3R1, among others.
In the above referenced in vitro screen of the battery of protein kinases (see Example 15), compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, and XIII displayed greater than 50% inhibition at 10 nM of BTK, BMX, ABL, ABL(E255K), SRC, ACK, ARG, BLK, DDR2, EPHA1, FGR, FMS, FRK, FYN(isoform a), HCK, LCK, LYNa, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, YES, and PIK3CA/PIK3R1.
As a further test of biological activity, compounds of the invention were assayed for inhibition of cell growth using diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell line SU-DHL-4 and chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K-562 (see Example 16). In this cell-based assay, the IC50 values for compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV were all less than 20 nM.
Protein kinase targets for compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV include, but are not limited to the following: ABL, ACK, ARG, BLK, BMX, BRK, BTK, CSK, DDR1, DDR2, EGFR, EPHA1, FGR, FMS, FRK, FYN, HCK, KIT, LCK, LYN, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, SRC, SRM, YES, and PIK3CA/PIK3R1.
The Tec family of kinases forms the second largest class of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases after the Src family kinases (SFKs) and consists of five mammalian members: Btk, Bmx (bone marrow kinase on the X-chromosome, also known as Etk), Itk (IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase), Rik (resting lymphocyte kinase, also known as Txk), and Tec (Hartkamp et al. Bruton's tyrosine kinase in chronic inflammation: from pathophysiology to therapy. Int J Interferon Cytokine Mediat Res. 2015; 7: 27-34). Most of the Tec family of kinases are primarily expressed in the hematopoietic system, although both Tec and Bmx are also expressed in stromal tissues such as liver and endothelial cells, respectively. Activation of Tec family kinases upon cell-surface receptor triggering requires relocalization of the protein to the plasma membrane, which is mediated by the interaction of the PH domain with the lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) P3, formed by activated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Subsequent phosphorylation by SFKs and autophosphorylation of tyrosine 223 result in the complete activation of Tec family of kinases.
BTK is the best-known member of the Tec family of kinases with BTK mutations leading to X-linked agammaglobulinemia in men and X-linked immunodeficiency in mice. BTK is a key regulator of B-cell development, activation, signaling, and survival (Hartkamp id). In addition, BTK plays an important role in a number of other hematopoietic cell-signaling pathways, e.g., toll-like receptor (TLR) and cytokine receptor-mediated TNF-alpha production in macrophages, IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) signaling in mast cells, inhibition of Fas/APO-1 apoptotic signaling in B-lineage lymphoid cells, and collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. BTK and other members of Tec family kinases can play a critical role in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes (T1D), systemic sclerosis (SSc), primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The BTK inhibitor ibrutinib demonstrated high clinical activity in B-cell malignancies, especially in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). However, resistance to ibrutinib has been demonstrated in a subgroup of patients receiving ibrutinib treatment, mainly due to the development of BTK mutant enzyme C481S (Woyach J A et al. Resistance mechanisms for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. N Engl J Med. 2014; 370(24):2286-94).
The tyrosine kinase BMX regulates inflammation induced by TNF and other mediators appear to do so by regulating the shared TAK1-TAB complex (Gottar-Guillier M et al. The tyrosine kinase BMX is an essential mediator of inflammatory arthritis in a kinase-independent manner. J Immunology. 2011; 186(10):6014). BMX kinase may play a role in the pathogenesis of glioblastoma, prostate, breast, and lung cancers. BMX has also shown potential as an anti-vascular therapy in combination with radiation or as a sensitizer to chemotherapeutic agents. (Jarboe J S et al. Mini-review: bmx kinase inhibitors for cancer therapy. Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov. 2013; 8(3):228-38).
Src family kinases (SFKs) consist of 11 nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including Src, Fyn, Yes, Blk, Yrk, Frk (also known as Rak), Fgr, Hck, Lck, Srm, and Lyn (Sen B, Johnson F M. Regulation of SRC family kinases in human cancers. J Signal Transduct. 2011:ID865819). Src is found in keratinocytes, whereas Blk, Fgr, Hck, Lck, and Lyn are found primarily in hematopoietic cells. Frk occurs chiefly in bladder, breast, brain, colon, and lymphoid cells. Src family kinases are involved in proliferation and migration responses in many cell types.
Src is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that plays a multitude of roles in cell signaling. Src is involved in the control of many functions, including cell adhesion, growth, movement, and differentiation. Src is widely expressed in many cell types, and can have different locations within a cell. Numerous human malignancies display increased SRC expression and activity, suggesting that SRC may be intimately involved in oncogenesis. SRC inhibitor bosutinib has been used or the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and saracatinib has been studied for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.
ABL is a cytoplasmic and nuclear protein tyrosine kinase that has been implicated in processes of cell differentiation, cell division, cell adhesion, and stress response (Hantschel O. Structure, regulation, signaling, and targeting of abl kinases in cancer. Genes Cancer. 2012; 3:436-46). ABL mutations are associated with cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Several ABL inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib have been used for treatment of CML, ALL, and AML. Dasatinib, a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL is used for treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, chronic, accelerated, or myeloid or lymphoid blast phase Ph+CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including imatinib, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ALL) with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy. However, dasatinib is associated with severe respiratory toxicity such as pleural effusion and pulmonary hypertension, which could be a result of dasatinib accumulation in lung tissue. (Quintás-Cardama A, et al. Pleural effusion in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with dasatinib after imatinib failure. J Clin Oncol. 2007; 25(25):3908-14; Guignabert C, et al. Dasatinib induces lung vascular toxicity and predisposes to pulmonary hypertension. J Clin Invest. 2016; 126(9):3207-18).
LCK is a 57.9 kDa membrane-associated non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome Ip34.3. The protein structure comprises an SH3 and SH2 domain. LCK inhibitors may be useful in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell lymphoma, lymphopenia, renal carcinoma, colon carcinoma, severe combined immunodeficiency, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel, and type I diabetes.
Frk is a 58.5 kDa tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 6q21-q22.3. The structure comprises an SH2, an SH3, and a tyrosine kinase domain. Inhibition of Frk could provide means to suppress beta-cell destruction in type I diabetes. Frk inhibitors may be useful in treating acute myeloid leukemia and type I diabetes.
Fyn is a 60.6 kDa non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 6q21. Fyn is involved in regulation of mast cell degranulation in a synergistic confluence of Fyn and Lyn pathways at the level of protein kinase C and calcium regulation. Fyn inhibitors may be useful in treating Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and in prevention of metastases, e.g., in melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
HCK is a 59.5 kDa tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 20ql 1.21. The protein structure comprises an SH3, an SH2, and a bipartite kinase domain. HCK inhibitors may be useful in treating chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia.
Kit is a 109.9 kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 4q12. Kit plays an important role in the development of melanocytes, mast, germ, and hematopoietic cells. Aberrant expression and/or activation of Kit has been implicated in a variety of pathologic states. Kit inhibitors may be useful in treating malignancies, including mast cell tumors, small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), glioblastoma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, carcinomas of the female genital tract, sarcomas of neuroectodermal origin, colorectal carcinoma, carcinoma in situ, Schwann cell neoplasia associated with neurofibromatosis, acute myelocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, mastocytosis, melanoma, and canine mast cell tumors, and inflammatory diseases, including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, allergic rhinitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel syndrome, transplant rejection, and hypereosinophilia.
LCK is a 57.9 kDa membrane associated non-receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome Ip34.3. The protein structure comprises an SH3 and SH2 domain. LCK inhibitors may be useful in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia, T-cell lymphoma, lymphopenia, renal carcinoma, colon carcinoma, severe combined immunodeficiency, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel, and type I diabetes.
Platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGF-R) are cell surface tyrosine kinase receptors for members of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) family. PDGF subunits-A and -B are important factors regulating cell proliferation, cellular differentiation, cell growth and development, and many diseases including cancer. There are two forms of the PDGF-R, alpha and beta, each encoded by a different gene. PDGFRα is a 122.7 kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 4ql2 (symbol: PDGFRA). PDGFRβ is a 124.0 kDa transmembrane tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 5q31-q32 (symbol: PDGFRB). PDGFR inhibitors may be useful in treating various diseases such as idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, glioma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, metastatic medulloblastoma, atherogenesis, and restenosis.
Yes is a 60.8 kDa tyrosine kinase encoded by chromosome 18pl 1.31-pl 1.21 (symbol: YESI). The structure of Yes comprises SH3 and SH2 domains followed by a TK domain. The YES oncogene is homologous to the Yamaguchi sarcoma virus gene, and the amino acid sequence of Yes shows a high degree of homology with that of the SRC gene product of Roussarcoma virus. The Yes kinase is highly expressed in multiple mammalian cell types, including neurons, spermatozoa, platelets, and epithelial cells. The target kinase Yes is amplified and overexpressed in various cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Yes inhibitors may be useful in treating cancers including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
In one aspect, compounds of formulas I, II, III, IV, and V, preferably compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV (compounds I-XIV), including salts, prodrugs, and/or isomers thereof, can be used in preparation of medicaments for the treatment of a kinase-mediated disease or condition, in particular when the disease or condition is an autoimmune disease or cancer.
The amounts of compounds of formulas I, II, III, IV, and V, compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and XIV (compounds I-XIV), including salts, prodrugs, and/or isomers thereof, to be administered can be determined by standard procedures taking into account factors such as the compound's IC50; the biological half-life of the compound; the age, size, and weight of the subject; and the condition associated with the subject. In general, routine experimentation in clinical trials will determine specific ranges for optimal therapeutic effect for each therapeutic agent and each administrative protocol and administration to specific patients will be adjusted to within effective and safe ranges depending on the patient's condition and responsiveness to initial administration. However, the ultimate administration protocol will be regulated according to the judgment of the attending clinician considering such factors as age, gender, condition, and size of the patient. Generally, doses of active compounds may range from about 0.01 mg/kg per day to about 1000 mg/kg per day. Compounds described herein can be administered in single or multiple doses.
Preclinical Pharmacokinetics
In Vitro Metabolic Stability:
An in vitro metabolic stability study in human liver microsomes was conducted for compounds I through XIII and dasatinib (see Example 17 for experimental conditions). Results from this study are shown in FIG. 1 and table 1.
Compounds I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII and XIII displayed significantly greater stability as compared to dasatinib. The in vitro t1/2 for compounds I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, and XIII were all >59 min compared to 16 min for dasatinib. This significant increase in metabolic stability for compounds I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, and XIII was unexpected. Longer in vitro metabolic stability half-life (t1/2) is an indicator of longer in vivo human plasma t1/2 for these compounds compared to dasatinb. Therefore, these compounds are expected to have a more favorable pharmacokinetic profile compared to dasatinib, specifically longer t1/2, longer duration of action, less first pass effect, and higher oral bioavailability. The intrinsic clearances for compounds I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, and XIII were less than 24 μL/min/mg compared to 88 μL/min/mg for dastatinib.
Surprisingly compound III, a deuterium labeled analog of dasatinib, was found to have similar metabolic stability to dasatinib (FIG. 1, table 1). This was an unexpected finding given the reported in vitro metabolism of dasatinib in human liver microsomes where hydroxylation at the 4-position of the 2-chloro-6-methylphenyl ring is a route of oxidative metabolism (Christopher L J et al. Biotransformation of [14C]dasatinib: in vitro studies in rat, monkey, and human and disposition after administration to rats and monkey. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2007; 36(7):1341-1356).
Compounds I, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, XII, and XIII, showed unexpectedly significantly increased metabolic stability in human liver microsomes compared to dasatinib, and deuterium substitution results in additional unexpected results as compared to dasatinib.

Following oral administrations, compounds IV, V, X, and XI showed surprisingly significantly higher Cmax values of 82±13, 35±19, 93±101, and 102±86 ng/mL, respectively, as compared to dasatinib where Cmax was 15±5 and 7±7 ng/mL and the deuterium analog of dasatinib, compound III, where Cmax was 9±6 and 11±11 ng/mL. The oral bioavailability of compounds IV, V, X, and XI was 18.9±6.7, 11.1±4.3, 18.9±2, and 24±33.1 percent bioavailability (F) compared to dasatinib oral bioavailability of 3.9±1 and 9.8±3.6 percent bioavailability, and compound III where oral bioavailability was 6±0.9 and 7.2±4.2 percent. The results from this study show compounds IV, V, X, and XI have surprisingly much lower intravenous plasma clearance than dasatinib and compound III. This data is consistent with the in vitro metabolic stability data which showed compounds IV, V, X, and XI to be significantly more stable than either dasatinib or compound III, and with significantly lower intrinsic clearance values.
Additionally, compounds IV, V, X, and XI were found to have a surprisingly significantly lower intravenous volume of distribution values than dasatinib and compound III, suggesting these compounds are not as widely distributed to tissues as compared to dasatinib and compound III. Further, this suggests these compounds have lower potential than dasatinib for drug-induced organ toxicity.
These results indicate that chemical substitution on the pyrimidin-4-yl group to produce compounds IV, V, X, and XI results in unexpected and significant changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of these novel compounds as compared to dasatinib.
In Vivo Tissue Distribution: A study was conducted in mice to determine the ratio of parent compound concentrations in lung tissue versus plasma for compounds X, XI, and dasatinib dosed by oral gavage (see Example 19 for experimental conditions). Results are shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.
Compounds X and XI unexpectedly showed significantly lower ratios for parent compound concentration levels in lung tissue compared to their plasma concentrations as compared to dasatinib at all time points tested (FIGS. 4 and 5). These results show that compounds X and XI distribute less than dasatinib into lung tissue.
Dasatinib is associated with severe respiratory toxicity such as pleural effusion and pulmonary hypertension, which have been attributed to the accumulation of dasatinib in lung tissue. (Quintás-Cardama A et al. Pleural effusion in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with dasatinib after imatinib failure. J Clin Oncol 2007; 25(25):3908-14; Wang X et al. Differential effects of dosing regimen on the safety and efficacy of dasatinib: retrospective exposure-response analysis of a Phase III study. Clin Pharmacol, 2013; 5: 85-97; Guignabert C et al. Dasatinib induces lung vascular toxicity and predisposes to pulmonary hypertension. J Clin Invest 2016; 126(9):3207-18; lurlo A, et al. Pleural effusion and molecular response in dasatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia patients in a real-life Italian multicenter series. Ann Hematol. 2017; Oct. 2. Doi: 10.1007/soo277-017-3144-1).
Therefore, the unexpected significantly lower distribution of compounds X and XI into lung tissue from plasma is suggestive of lower potential of these compounds to accumulate in lung tissue, and therefore, a lower potential for drug-induced lung toxicity as compared to dasatinib.

General Synthetic Methods
The present invention also includes processes for the preparation of the novel deuterium-enriched and non-enriched compounds of the invention. In the reactions described, it can be necessary to protect reactive functional groups, for example hydroxy, amino, imino, thio, or carboxy groups, where these are desired in the final product, to avoid their unwanted participation in the reactions. Conventional protecting groups can be used in accordance with standard practice, for example, see TW Greene and PGM Wutsin Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John Wiley and Sons, 1991.
Compounds of formulas I, II, III, IV, and V, including the exemplary compounds, can generally be synthesized by making appropriate modifications to reagents of scheme 1 (and other applicable schemes) below as would be understood by the person of ordinary skill in the art. It is noted that non-deuterated intermediates are generally commercially available and so the synthesis could be started, for example, at compound 7 (see e.g. compound 7H in schemes 8-14) using the appropriate commercially available intermediate.
Compound I can be synthesized by the method shown in Scheme 1.

The initial step of the chemical process involves reacting 4-bromo-2-chloro-6-methylaniline (1) with allyl bromide to form intermediate 2. To intermediate 2 in dry tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen gas at about −70° C. is added dropwise n-butyl lithium (about 1.5 moles n-butyl lithium to 1 mole intermediate 2). After about 40 minutes, the intermediate lithium complex is quenched with d1-methanol (CH3OD; 99% deuterium, #550574; Lot # MKBW0355V, Aldrich, St Louis, Mo.) to selectively incorporate deuterium at the 4 position and give intermediate 3. The allyl protecting groups are removed by standard procedure to give the aniline intermediate 4. Intermediate 4 is reacted with 3-ethoxyacryloyl chloride to form theacrylamide intermediate 5 which is then treated with N-bromosuccinimide and thiourea to form the thiazole intermediate 6. The thiazole intermediate 6 is treated with the base sodium hydride followed by addition of 4,6-dichloro-2-methylpyrimidine to form the 2-[(6-chloro-2-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)amino]-N-(2-chloro-4-deutero-6-methylphenyl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (intermediate 7).

Cell Inhibition Assay
Cell lines of SU-DHL-4 (ATCC® CRL-2957™), K-562 (ATCC® CCL-243™), and Mino (ATCC® CRL-3000™) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va.). SU-DHL-4 cells and Mino cells grew in ATCC-formulated RPMI-1640 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)(Gibco, Life Technologies) (complete medium) a T-75 flask at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity. K-562 cells grew in ATCC-formulated Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, Life Technologies) (complete medium) a T-75 flask at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity. When the cells grew to a concentration of approximately 1×106 cells/mL, they were diluted to 2.5-5×104 cells/mL with the corresponding complete medium for each cell line. A200 μL aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the well of a 96-well plate which was pre-added with 1 μL of the test compounds at various concentrations, and the plate was incubated at 37° C. under 5% CO2 with saturated humidity for 48 h. At end of the cell culture, a 10 μL aliquot of PrestoBlue® Cell Viability reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) was added into the well, and the plate was incubated at 37° C. for approximately 60 min. The absorptions at 570 and 600 nm were measured with a SpectraMaxMicroplate reader (Molecular Devices). The absorbance at 570 nm was normalized to that at 600 nm. The normalized absorbance at 570 nm was used for IC50 calculation following the median-effect plot method (TC Chou.Theoretical basis, experimental design, and computerized simulation of synergism and antagonism in drug combination studies. Pharmacol Rev. 2006; 58:621-681).
Compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV showed concentration-dependent inhibition of growth of SU-DHL-4 with IC50 values of <15 nM, respectively.
Compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII, and XIV showed concentration-dependent inhibition of growth of K562 cells with IC50 values of <2 nM, respectively.
Compounds I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XIII and XIV showed concentration-dependent inhibition of growth of Mino with IC50 values of <50 nM, respectively.

Metabolic Stability
Metabolic stability in liver microsomes:test compounds and dasatinib were incubated at a concentration of 1 μM in human liver microsomes (0.5 mg/mL) (Corning Inc., Tewksbury, Mass.) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM NADPH and 2 mM UDPGA for time points ranging from zero to 60 min at 37° C. (see FIG. 1). Dasatinib (HY10181/CS0100, 302962-49-8, Batch No: 13044) was purchased from MedChemExpress USA (Monmouth Junction, N.J.). The incubation reactions at various time points were quenched by adding 2× volumes of acetonitrile containing 100 nM reserpine. The quenched incubation samples were centrifuged at 4000 RPM for 10 min, and the supernatants injected for LC/MS/MS analysis. LC/MS/MS analysis was carried out on a AB Sciex 4000 Q Trap LC/MS/MS system coupled with Shimadzu Prominence UFLCXR 20 series (including a CBM-20A controller, two LC-20ADXR solvent delivery units, SIL-20AC HT autosampler, CTO-20A column oven, and a SPD-20A UV detector). The samples were separated on a Phenomenex Columbus column (C18, 4 μm, 50×2 mm) eluted with two solvent systems: 2 mM ammonium acetate in water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and methanol (B) at a linear gradient starting with 25% B. Electrospray ionization in positive mode was used to acquire LC/MS/MS data. The in vitro t1/2 and intrinsic clearance were calculated using method previous reported (Obatch S. Prediction of human clearance of twenty-nine drugs from hepatic microsomal intrinsic clearance data: An examination of in vitro half-life approach and nonspecific binding to microsomes. Drug Metab Dispos. 1999; 27(11):1350-9).
