TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a Brk inhibitory compound represented by the following general formula (I):(wherein, all the symbols have the same meanings as described below), a salt thereof, a solvate thereof, an N-oxide thereof, or a prodrug of any of these (hereinafter, referred to as the compound of the present invention), and a medicament comprising the same as an active ingredient.
BACKGROUND ART
Brk (Breast tumor kinase) is also referred to as PTK6 (protein tyrosine kinase 6), and is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase which belongs to FRK (Fyn-related kinase)/PTK6 family kinases which are tyrosine kinases. Brk is coded by 451 amino acids. Brk was identified from human normal melanocytes in the first place, and immediately after that, Brk was identified in breast cancer. Brk is highly expressed in a lot of tumors including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, prostate cancer, oral squamous cell cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer, melanoma, B-cell lymphoma, and T-cell lymphoma. In particular, Brk is a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer, prostate cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, and non-small-cell lung cancer. In addition, it is thought that Brk plays important roles in tumorigenesis such as promotion of proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and avoidance of cell death (see Non Patent Literatures 1 to 7).
Accordingly, it is thought that a compound which inhibits activation of Brk is useful for treating various types of cancer.
On the other hand, it has been described in Patent Literature 1 that, a compound of the following general formula (A) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or a derivative thereof is used for treatment or amelioration of one or more symptoms of α-synuclein toxicity, α-synuclein mediated diseases, or diseases in which α-synuclein fibrils are a symptom or cause of the disease.

Pharmacological Experimental Examples:
Pharmacological Experimental Example 1: Measurement of Brk inhibitory activity
Measurement of an inhibitory activity on Brk enzyme was performed by using LanthaScreen (registered trademark) system (Invitrogen) in accordance with the attached manual. Reagents used are described below.
Reaction Buffer: A solution containing 50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.01% Brij 35, 10 mmol/L MgCl2 and 1 mmol/L EGTA was prepared by using purified water.
A solution of a test substance (the compound of the present invention): A solution of each concentration of a test compound in DMSO was diluted 20-fold with Reaction Buffer, and a solution containing a test compound at a concentration 5 times a final concentration was prepared.
An enzyme solution: A solution containing 480 ng/mL of Brk enzyme was prepared by using Reaction Buffer.
A substrate solution: A solution containing 57 µmol/L of ATP and 500 nmol/L of Fluorescein-Poly GT (Invitrogen) was prepared by using Reaction Buffer.
A detection solution: A solution containing 20 mmol/L of EDTA and 4 nmol/L of PY20 (Invitrogen) was prepared by using Dilution B (Invitrogen).
To a 96-well plate (Nunc), a solution of 10 mmol/L of a test compound in DMSO was dispensed, and further, a dilution series at a common ratio of three was prepared by using DMSO. To each of wells of the 96-well plate for the measurement, 5 µL of Reaction Buffer containing DMSO was added for a blank group and a vehicle group and 5 µL of a test substance solution was added for a test substance group. Next, 10 µL per well of Reaction Buffer was added for the blank group, and 10 µL per well of the enzyme solution was added for the vehicle group and the test compound group, and thereafter, the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. After completion of stirring, 10 µL of the substrate solution was added to each of wells, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature under a shading condition for 1 hour. After completion of the reaction, 25 µL of the detection solution was added to each well, and the mixture was left to stand at room temperature under a shading condition for 30 minutes. After being left standing, fluorescence intensities at 520 nm and 495 nm were measured by using Analyst GT (Molecular Devices, LLC) when being irradiated with an excitation light at 340 nm. The phosphorylation of the artificial substrate was quantified by Time-Resolved Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (TR-FRET). With regard to each well, the TR-FRET ratio was calculated by divining the fluorescence signal at 520 nm by the fluorescence signal at 495 nm, and the inhibition rate (%) in the test compound group was calculated according to the following Numerical Formula 1. Inhibition rate %=1−TR−FRET ratio of test compound group−A/B−A×100A: Mean value of TR-FRET ratio of blank groupB: Mean value of TR-FRET ratio of vehicle group
The value (IC50 value) of 50% inhibition rate of the test compound was calculated from the inhibition curve based on the inhibition rate at each concentration of the test compound.
As a result, it was found that each IC50 value of the compounds of the present invention was equal to or lower than 0.1 µmol/L, and the compound of the present invention has a potent Brk inhibitory activity. For example, IC50 values of several compounds of the present invention were as shown in the following Table 1.

In addition, Peptide/Kinase Buffer composed of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT; 2 mM), Tyr 2 Peptide (2 µM), Kinase Buffer and Lck was added to the assay plate, and the reaction solution was preincubated at 25°C for 20 minutes.

After incubation, Coloring Solution A (10 µL) composed of Coloring Reagent B and Coloring Buffer was added, and the reaction solution was incubated at 25°C for 1 hour. Stop Reagent (10 µL) was added to each well such that the enzymatic reaction stopped. The fluorescent coloring of each well was measured on a fluorescent plate reader by using wavelengths of 445 nm and 520 nm. The ratio of phosphorylation was determined by a ratio of coloring at 445 nm to that at 520 nm according to the attached manual.
The inhibition rate (%) of the compound of the present invention was calculated according to the following Numerical Formula 2. Inhibition rate %=1−AX−AB/AC−AB×100AX: Ratio of phosphorylation at addition of the compound of the present inventionAB: Ratio of phosphorylation in blankAC: Ratio of phosphorylation at addition of only DMSO

To the mixture, 60 µL of Termination Buffer (QuickScout Screening Assist MSA; Carna Biosciences, Inc.) was added to stop the reaction. The substrate peptide and the phosphorylated peptide in the reaction solution were separated, and were quantified. The kinase reaction was evaluated by a product ratio (P/(P + S)) calculated from a peak height (S) of the substrate peptide and a peak height (P) of the phosphorylated peptide.
