TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a marine sessile organisms-repelling composition for combating marine fouling by marine injurious sessile organisms, particularly exerting a noticeable antifouling effect on Hydrozoa.
BACKGROUND ART
Marine injurious sessile organisms, such as Barnacle, Hydrozoa, mussel, Bryozoa, and algae, known as fouling organisms cause massive damage by adhering to undersea structures, such as a ship bottom, a fishing net for culture, a fixed shore net, a buoy, and an offshore oilfield rig; cooling water intake channels and heat exchangercooling water pipelines to coastal industrial plants, such as a thermal power plant, and sea water intake facilities, such as an aquarium and a cultural fishery center. For combatting these organisms, antifouling agents have conventionally been mainly used which comprise organotin compounds, such as tributyltin oxide (TBTO), and heavy metals, such as cuprous oxide.
Organotin antifouling paints are paints having an excellent antifouling effect and have widely been used as ship bottom paints, but have turned out to cause the sterilization of snails and affect other marine organisms as their usage amount is increased. Thus, their use has been gotten under entire control on a global basis from 2008. For cuprous oxide, examples are reported where it is accumulated on the sea bottom of places, such as a yacht harbor, in which it is used in large amounts, and has reached concentrations producing concern about affecting marine organisms. It is presently an urgent challenge to take any of economical and green countermeasures against sessile organisms, among which a method for controlling adhesion using a natural interorganism action substance (a living substance affecting other individuals, such as a pheromone or an allelochemical) is considered, for example.
Patent Literature 1 proposes an antifouling agent against marine injurious sessile organisms Repellent activity test on the cypris larva of Balanus Amphitrite was carried out in an incubator and the adherence inhibition rate and death rate due to the antifouling agent is shown; however, the test will be a test in an incubator and there is not any suggestion with respect to the antifouling effect of an antifouling agent composition containing the antifouling agent and further the effect on Hydrozoa, mussel, Bryozoa, and algae except Balanus Amphitrite is not examined in any manner. In this technical field, it is also known that such an agent may exert no desired effect in quite a few cases in an actual ocean test, which has various parameters, such as ocean current and the mediation of other organisms, in spite of having a high standing in vitro.

Among the above compounds, AF-024, AF-034, AF-035, and AF-048 are reported to have concentrations corresponding to the 50% adhesion inhibition rate to Barnacle (EC50) of 0.054, 0.0084, 0.03, and 0.019 μg/ml, respectively. The EC50s of the remaining compounds are still not known. AF-034, AF-035, and AF-048 were used as comparative examples for describing effects in actual ocean tests since they had lower EC50 values than that of AF-024. As clear from the following Examples, AF-024 exhibited an especially excellent repelling effect compared to AF-034, AF-035, and AF-048.
