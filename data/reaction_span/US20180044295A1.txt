TECHNICAL FIELD
This invention relates to compounds that can be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases, for example, by modulating mitochondrial function in neuronal cells.
BACKGROUND
Neurodegenerative diseases occur when changes in the neurons of the brain and spinal cord cause them to function abnormally, eventually result in their deterioration and death. Symptoms may initially be mild, but they progressively worsen as more and more neurons die. For example, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that has no cure, and is associated with progressive cognitive decline in the aging population. Extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein represent the major hallmarks of AD pathology (Braak and Braak, Acta Neuropathologica, 82:239-259, 1991). The etiology of sporadic AD, which represents over 95% of all cases, is unknown, with age being the single risk factor. Familial AD (FAD) is caused by mutations in presenilin 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2) and amyloid precursor protein (APP), all of which are involved in the abnormal processing of APP, leading to increased levels of Aβ. The specific molecular mechanisms of sporadic and familial AD are still under investigation, hindering the development of effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging data from multiple animal studies and clinical investigations, however, suggest that there is a tight connection between Aβ and p-tau, and development of strategies that target both mechanisms could be beneficial (Mondragon-Rodriguez et al., Int J Alzheimers Dis, 2012:630182, 2012).
SUMMARY
Altered mitochondrial dynamics is an underlying and early event in progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntingon's disease (HD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). This document is based in part on the identification of molecules that can efficiently restore mitochondrial dynamics in neurons and enhance their bioenergetics. A tricyclic pyrone compound (CP2) can restore axonal trafficking of mitochondria in neurons, alleviating the development of behavior and memory phenotypes in multiple transgenic mouse models of FAD. As described herein, an array of new experimental compounds was subjected to biological screening to assess their toxicity, and to identify compounds that possess the ability to restore mitochondrial function in cells that express amyloid beta peptides. Four classes of compounds with properties superior to CP2 were identified, and several of those compounds were characterized in primary neurons. This document provides compounds from those classes, as well as compositions containing one or more of the compounds, and methods for making and using the compounds and compositions to treat, prevent, or delay the onset of AD. It is to be noted that these compounds and compositions also may be beneficial in treating, preventing, or delaying the onset of other diseases and disorders, such as HD, PD, dementia (e.g., frontotemporal dementia), traumatic brain injury (TBI), multiple sclerosis (MS), ALS, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies, Down Syndrome, and aging. Such compounds also may increase health span and fecundity, promoting a prolonged period of health with increasing age, and delaying the onset of age-related diseases.

The scope of this document also encompasses solvates and salts of the compounds described herein, as well as prodrugs of the compounds, such as esters, amides, and acylated groups, among others. In some embodiments, for example, this document provides prodrugs of the compounds disclosed herein, which may contain, for example, acylated phenols or acyl derivatives of amines. By “prodrug” is meant, for example, any compound (whether itself active or inactive) that is converted chemically in vivo into a biologically active compound as provided herein, following administration of the prodrug to a subject. In some embodiments, a prodrug is a covalently bonded carrier that releases the active parent drug when administered to a subject. Prodrugs can be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compounds. Prodrugs can include compounds in which hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, or carboxyl group respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, without limitation, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups in the compounds provided herein. The suitability and techniques involved in making and using prodrugs are discussed in Higuchi and Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the ACS Symposium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed.

A compound as provided herein can be administered alone or in combination with one or more other compounds provided herein, or in combination with one or more other drugs (or as any combination thereof). Generally, a compound will be administered as a formulation in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. The term “excipient” is used herein to describe any ingredient other than a compound(s) provided herein. The choice of excipient will to a large extent depend on factors such as the particular mode of administration, the effect of the excipient on solubility and stability, and the nature of the dosage form.
Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutical excipients suitable for administration of the compounds provided herein include any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be suitable for the particular mode of administration. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include, without limitation, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) such as d-α-tocopherol polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate, surfactants used in pharmaceutical dosage forms such as Tweens or other similar polymeric delivery matrices, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium-chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, and wool fat.

In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition can be formulated into suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as solutions, suspensions, tablets, dispersible tablets, pills, capsules, powders, sustained release formulations or elixirs, for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration, as well as transdermal ointments, creams, gels, and patch preparations and dry powder inhalers (see, e.g., Ansel Introduction to Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms, Fourth Edition 1985, 126).
The concentration of a compound in a pharmaceutical composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and excretion rates of the compound, the physicochemical characteristics of the compound, the dosage schedule, and the amount administered, as well as other factors known to those of skill in the art.
A pharmaceutical composition can be administered at once, or can be divided into a number of smaller doses to be administered at intervals of time. It is understood that the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a function of the disease being treated and may be determined empirically using known testing protocols or by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may also vary with the severity of the condition to be alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any particular patient, specific dosage regimens should be adjusted over time according to the individual need and the professional judgment of the person administering or supervising the administration of the compositions, and that the concentration ranges set forth herein are exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or practice of the claimed compositions.
The pharmaceutical compositions can be provided for administration to humans and animals in unit dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, oral solutions or suspensions, and oil-water emulsions containing suitable quantities of the compound(s). The pharmaceutically therapeutically active compounds are, in some embodiments, formulated and administered in unit-dosage forms or multiple-dosage forms. Unit-dose forms as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable for human and animal patients and packaged individually as is known in the art. Each unit-dose contains a predetermined quantity of the therapeutically active compound sufficient to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier, vehicle or diluent. Examples of unit-dose forms include ampoules and syringes and individually packaged tablets or capsules. Unit-dose forms may be administered in fractions or multiples thereof. A multiple-dose form is a plurality of identical unit-dosage forms packaged in a single container to be administered in segregated unit-dose form. Examples of multiple-dose forms include vials, bottles of tablets or capsules or bottles of pints or gallons. Hence, multiple dose form is a multiple of unit-doses that are not segregated in packaging.
Liquid pharmaceutically administrable compositions can be prepared by, for example, dissolving, dispersing, or otherwise mixing a compound as provided herein and optional pharmaceutical adjuvants in a carrier such as, without limitation, water, saline, aqueous dextrose, glycerol, glycols, ethanol, and the like, to form a solution or suspension.

Such compositions and methods for their preparation can be found, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 19th Edition (Mack Publishing Company, 1995).
Methods of Use
This document also provides methods and materials for using compounds that modulate (e.g., increase or decrease) the activity of mitochondrial Complex I and affect cellular energetics. Mitochondrial bioenergetics include the production of energy from nutrients in the form of glucose and fat, and are conducted in the mitochondrial matrix using enzymatic complexes of oxidative phosphorylation machinery (e.g., Complex I). Thus, via modulation of Complex I activity, cellular energetics as a whole can be modulated. For example, a compound as provided herein can decrease the activity of Complex I that results in decreased basal respiration of mitochondria, thus affecting bioenergetics. It is to be noted that decreasing the activity of Complex I also may improve recovery from ischemia or reperfusion, which can result in inflammation and oxidative damage through the induction of oxidative stress as blood returns to the tissue after a period of ischemia or lack of oxygen. Thus, the compounds and compositions described herein can provide cardioprotection from hypoxia/ischemia, and can be used to treat subjects identified as being in need of such cardioprotection.
In some cases, a compound as provided herein can be used to treat a disease or disorder that involves mitochondrial dysfunction. For example, mitochondrial motility can be restored in a patient by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound provided herein. In addition, mitochondrial function can be increased in a cell by contacting the cell with an effective amount of a compound provided herein.
Diseases and disorders that involve mitochondrial dysfunction include, for example, neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, HD, PD, various types of dementia (e.g., frontotemporal dementia), MS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), diabetes, metabolic syndrome, cancer, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies, and Down Syndrome, as well as aging. In some embodiments, the compounds provided herein also can promote healthy aging, and increase longevity and fecundity.
Compounds provided herein are effective to modulate mitochondrial function in a cell, for example, in a neural cell. Therefore, this document also provides a method of modulating (e.g., restoring) mitochondrial dynamics in a cell, comprising contacting the cell with an effective amount of a compound provided herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof. The method can be performed by contacting the cell with a compound as described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt form thereof, in vitro, thereby modulating mitochondrial dynamics and function in vitro. Uses of such an in vitro method include, without limitation, use in a screening assay (e.g., wherein a compound described herein is used as a positive control or standard compared to compounds of unknown activity or potency in modulating mitochondrial function).
In the methods provided herein, any appropriate method can be used to administer a compound to a subject. Administration can be, for example, parenteral (e.g., by subcutaneous, intrathecal, intraventricular, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection, or by intravenous drip). Administration can be rapid (e.g., by injection) or can occur over a period of time (e.g., by slow infusion or administration of slow release formulations). In some embodiments, administration can be topical (e.g., transdermal, sublingual, ophthalmic, or intranasal), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols), or oral.
A compound provided herein can be administered to a subject in an appropriate amount, at an appropriate frequency, and for an appropriate duration effective to achieve a desired outcome (e.g., to reduce one or more clinical symptoms or molecular/cellular hallmarks of a neurodegenerative disease such as AD, to protect or restore mitochondrial function in cells within a subject with the disease, or to reduce the likelihood of the disease or delay or prevent the onset of the disease in a subject at risk of developing the disease, such as a subject carrying a mutation in a PS1, PS2, or APP gene that is associated with AD, or carrying an ApoE4 allele that predisposes a subject to the development of AD). When the disease is AD, symptoms and hallmarks that can be reduced by treatment with a compound or composition as provided herein include, for example, cognitive decline, formation of extracellular Aβ plaques and/or intracellular NFTs, and abnormal processing of APP. Thus, administration of an effective amount of a compound or composition as provided herein can result in improved cognitive function, reduced formation or numbers of Aβ plaques and/or NFTs (e.g., reduced by at least about 5 percent, about 10 percent, about 25 percent, about 50 percent, about 75 percent, about 90 percent, or more than 90 percent, as compared to the formation or number of Aβ plaques and/or NFTs in the subject prior to administration of the compound or composition, or in a control subject or population of subjects to whom the compound or composition was not administered), and/or reduced abnormal processing of APP in a subject. Any suitable method can be used to assess cognitive function/decline, Aβ plaque formation or number, NFT formation or number, and APP processing in a subject. Such methods can include, without limitation, neuropsychological tests (e.g., question-and-answer tests or other tasks) that measure memory, language skills, ability to do arithmetic, and other abilities related to brain functioning; tests of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, or other medical tests to assess neurological functioning associated with dementia; computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tests that can reveal changes in brain structure that indicate AD; other imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); PIB-PET imaging that can detect amyloid in the brain of a living patient; and emerging methods of diagnosis such as metabolomic and epigenetic profiling.
Further, administration of an effective amount of a compound or composition as provided herein can result in enhanced ability to sustain oxidative damage or produce energy under stress conditions, and/or in restored mitochondrial dynamics in cells of a subject, where the mitochondrial function is increased by at least about 5% (e.g., about 25%, about 50%, about 75%, or more than about 75%). Mitochondrial function in cells of a subject can be assessed by, for example, evaluating levels of spare respiratory capacity, axonal motility, ATP production, coupling efficiency of respiratory chain, level of proton leak, Complex I activity, and/or NAD+/NADH ratios, using methods such as those described herein. In some embodiments, mitochondrial function can be assessed in peripheral cells (e.g., fibroblasts or lymphocytes) using methods described herein, including evaluation of Complex I-V activity, ATP production, and resistance to oxidative damage and stress. Parameters of mitochondrial energetics in cells from treated AD patients also can be evaluated using, e.g., a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (see, Lange et al., Frontiers Neurol, 3:175, 2012). Mitochondrial function in AD patients also can be assessed using FDG-PET to monitor levels of glucose utilization in affected brain regions, and by measuring levels of mitochondrial metabolites using proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy such as lactate, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), and mio-inositol. In addition, mitochondrial function can be assessed in blood, plasma, CSF, and/or peripheral cells/tissue by application of metabolomics profiling (see, e.g., Trushina et al., PLOS ONE, 8:e63644, 2013).
Optimum dosages of a compound or composition as provided herein can vary depending on the relative potency of individual compounds, and can generally be estimated based on EC so found to be effective in in vitro and in vivo animal models. Dosages may fall within the range from 0.5 mg to 500 mg. For example, an effective amount of a compound as provided herein can be from about 0.5 mg to about 1 mg, about 1 mg to about 5 mg, about 5 mg to about 10 mg, about 10 mg to about 25 mg, about 25 mg to about 50 mg, about 50 to about 100 mg, about 100 mg to about 250 mg, or about 250 mg to about 500 mg. If a particular subject fails to respond to a particular amount, then the amount of the compound or composition can be increased by, for example, two fold. After receiving this higher concentration, the subject can be monitored for both responsiveness to the treatment and toxicity symptoms, and adjustments made accordingly. The effective amount can remain constant or can be adjusted as a sliding scale or variable dose depending on the subject's response to treatment. Various factors can influence the actual effective amount used for a particular application. For example, the frequency of administration, duration of treatment, and severity of disease may require an increase or decrease in the actual effective amount administered.
The frequency of administration can be any frequency that has a desired effect (e.g., reducing one or more clinical symptoms or molecular/cellular hallmarks of AD, increasing or restoring mitochondrial function in cells within a subject with AD, or delaying or preventing the onset of AD in a subject at risk of AD), without producing significant toxicity. For example, the frequency of administration can be once or more daily, biweekly, weekly, monthly, or even less. The frequency of administration can remain constant or can be variable during the duration of treatment. A course of treatment can include rest periods. For example, a composition containing one or more compounds as provided herein can be administered over a two week period followed by a two week rest period, and such a regimen can be repeated multiple times. As with the effective amount, various factors can influence the actual frequency of administration used for a particular application. For example, the effective amount, duration of treatment, route of administration, and severity of disease may require an increase or decrease in administration frequency.
An effective duration for administering a compound provided herein can be any duration that has a desired effect (e.g., for AD, reducing one or more clinical symptoms or molecular/cellular hallmarks of AD, enhancing or restoring mitochondrial function in cells within a subject with AD, or delaying or preventing the onset of AD in a subject at risk of AD), without producing significant toxicity. Thus, an effective duration can vary from several days to several weeks, months, or years, but in general, an effective duration for treatment of AD can extend for number of years, such that an effective duration can be for as long as an individual subject is alive. Multiple factors can influence the actual effective duration used for a particular treatment. For example, an effective duration can vary with the frequency of administration, effective amount, use of multiple treatment agents, route of administration, and severity of the disease.
After administering a compound as provided herein to subject having or at risk for developing a disorder such as AD, the subject can be monitored to determine whether or not the disorder has been treated or prevented. For AD, for example, a subject can be assessed after treatment to determine whether or not a symptom of AD has been reduced, or whether any symptoms or hallmarks of AD have developed (e.g., in the case of a person at risk for developing AD). Methods for assessing symptoms and hallmarks of AD are described herein.
In some embodiments, an effective amount of a compound as described herein, or a composition containing a compound as described herein, can be any amount that reduces the severity, progression, or recurrence of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, or lymphoma) in a subject (e.g., a human or a non-human mammal), without producing significant toxicity to the subject. Effective doses can vary depending on the severity of the cancer, the route of administration, the age and general health condition of the subject, excipient usage, the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments, and the judgment of the treating physician. If a recipient fails to respond to a particular amount, then the amount of a compound or composition can be increased by, for example, two fold. After receiving this higher amount, the subject can be monitored for both responsiveness to the treatment and toxicity symptoms, and adjustments made accordingly. The effective amount can remain constant or can be adjusted as a sliding scale or variable dose depending on the response to treatment. Various factors can influence the actual effective amount used for a particular application. For example, the frequency of administration, duration of treatment, use of multiple treatment agents, route of administration, and severity of the cancer may require an increase or decrease in the actual effective amount administered.
The frequency of administration can be any frequency that reduces the severity, progression, or recurrence of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, or lymphoma) in a subject (e.g., a human or a non-human mammal) without producing significant toxicity to the subject. For example, the frequency of administration can be from about once a week to about three times a day. The frequency of administration can remain constant or can be variable during the duration of treatment. A course of treatment with a composition containing one or more of the compounds described herein can include rest periods. For example, a composition can be administered daily over a two week period followed by a two week rest period, and such a regimen can be repeated multiple times. As with the effective amount, various factors can influence the actual frequency of administration used for a particular application. For example, the effective amount, duration of treatment, use of multiple treatment agents, route of administration, and severity of the cancer may require an increase or decrease in administration frequency.
An effective duration for administering a composition containing one or more compounds as described herein can be any duration that reduces the severity, progression, or recurrence of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, or lymphoma) without producing significant toxicity to the recipient. Thus, the effective duration can vary from several days to several weeks, months, or years. In general, the effective duration for the treatment with one or more compounds as described herein to reduce the severity, progression, or recurrence of cancer (e.g., pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, or lymphoma) can range in duration from one week to one year (e.g., one month to six months). Multiple factors can influence the actual effective duration used for a particular treatment. For example, an effective duration can vary with the frequency of administration, effective amount, use of multiple treatment agents, route of administration, and severity of the cancer being treated.
In some embodiments, a course of treatment and the severity of one or more symptoms related to the cancer being treated (e.g., pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, or lymphoma) can be monitored. Any appropriate method can be used to determine whether or not the severity of a symptom is reduced. For example, the severity of a symptom of pancreatic cancer (e.g., cancer recurrence) can be assessed using imaging techniques.
Also provided herein are articles of manufacture containing one or more compounds as described herein, or a pharmaceutical composition containing one or more compounds as described herein, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, for example. The compound or composition can be within a container (e.g., a bottle, vial, or syringe). The article of manufacture also can include a label with directions for reconstituting and/or using the compound(s) or composition. In some embodiments, an article of manufacture can include one or more additional items (e.g., one or more buffers, diluents, filters, needles, syringes, and/or package inserts with further instructions for use).
The invention will be further described in the following examples, which do not limit the scope of the invention described in the claims.
EXAMPLE
Example 1
Identification of Small Molecule Compounds for Restoring Mitochondrial Function
An array of 24 compounds was synthesized and purified. CP2 (FIG. 1), a tricyclic pyrone compound that protects against amyloid and mutant huntingtin toxicity in cellular and animals models of AD and HD (Trushina et al., BMC Neurosci, 10:73, 2009; Rana et al., Bioorg Med Chem Lett, 19:670-674, 2009; Maezawa et al., J Neurochem, 98:57-67, 2006; Hong et al., J Neurochem, 108(4):1097-1108, 2009 (published online 25 Dec. 2008); and Zhang et al., eBioMedicine, 2015), was synthesized as a TFA salt and free base to provide a reference compound for biological testing. All synthesized compounds were HPLC purified and had a final purity over 95%.
All 24 compounds were screened to test their toxicity and efficacy. Specifically, the toxicity of the compounds was evaluated in (1) the SK-N-MC cell line, a parental cell line for the Tet on/off MC65 cells, and (2) primary mouse cortical neurons. In addition, the efficiency of each compound (along with CP2) was evaluated against Aβ toxicity in MC65 cells, Tet on/off cells generated to express Aβ.
Example 2
Toxicity in SK-N-MC Neuroepithelioma Cells
Toxicity of the 24 new compounds, CP2 free base, and CP2 TFA salt was evaluated in the SK-N-MC neuroepithelioma cell line. SK-N-MC is a parental cell line for MC65 cells that conditionally express Aβ and have been used previously to test the effect of CP2 against Aβ toxicity (Maezawa et al., J Neurochem, 98:57-67, 2006). SK-N-MC were treated at 1 μM, 2.5 μM, 5 μM and 20 μM with each compound or vehicle (DMSO 0.05%-water). Cell viability was measured using a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2, 5-dyphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT assay) after 48 hours. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, most of the compounds did not cause toxicity at 1-20 μM, except for compounds 463 and 464, where treatment with 10 μM resulted in 50% cell death. Compounds 452-454, 456-462, 470, and 471 became modestly toxic (˜20%) in the range of 2.5 μM to 5 μM. Thus, this range of concentrations was selected for the rest of the screening studies.
Example 3
Toxicity in Primary Mouse Cortical Neurons
Toxicity of the 24 compounds, CP2 free base, and CP2 TFA salt was evaluated in primary mouse embryonic (E17) cortical neurons (FIGS. 3A and 3B). Most of the compounds were not toxic or had low (˜20%) toxicity (C453, C457, C461) at concentrations of 2.5 μM to 5 μM.
Example 4
Efficacy of Novel Compounds Against Aβ Toxicity in MC65 Cell Line
The efficacy of all 24 compounds against Aβ toxicity was evaluated in MC65 cells. These cells are stably transfected with Aβ expression vector under tetracycline control, and were used to study CP2 properties against Aβ toxicity as described elsewhere (Maezawa et al., J Neurochem, 98:57-67, 2006). The viability of MC65 cells expressing Aβ (Tet/off, 40% viability) or not expressing Aβ (Tet/on, 100% viability) was measured after treatment with individual compounds. Results for all 24 compounds against Aβ toxicity are presented in FIGS. 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 6B.
The efficacy of all 24 compounds against Aβ toxicity was compared to that of CP2 free base and CP2 TFA salt (FIG. 7). These studies led to the identification of four compounds (FIGS. 8A-8D; C455, C458, C460, and C472, respectively) that had promising cell protective activity in Aβ-producing MC65 cells. Various properties of these four compounds are presented in TABLE 1. The four compounds were selected for further studies to assess mitochondrial function and dynamics in neurons.

Measurement of EC50 for Four Selected Compounds
To further characterize the efficacy of these four compounds, the half maximal effective concentration (EC50) against Ap toxicity in MC65 cells was measured using an MTT assay. EC50 values were calculated by fitting experimental data to calculated data for nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prizm5 software. The results are presented in FIGS. 9A-9D. Compound C458 demonstrated 100-fold higher efficacy than C455 and C460, and 20-to 30-fold higher efficacy than CP2, with EC50 near 4 nM.
Example 6
Toxicity, Histology, and Pharmacokinetics (PK) of C458
The feasibility of developing the C458 series was evaluated by determining the in vivo PK profile for C458. Re-synthesized C458 was administered intravenously to wild type mice at 2 mg/kg. Frozen serum and brain tissue samples were analyzed using a bioanalytical LC-MS/MS method. The resulting PK data showed that the compound persisted in the blood with an apparent tv2 of 48 min (TABLE 2). Further, the compound showed significant CNS penetration, as evidenced concentrations in the brain tissue that were 7-10 times higher (w/v) than in plasma.
Treatment of wild type (WT) mice with C458 (50 mg/kg for one month ad libitum in drinking water) did not cause histological abnormalities in animals. As noted above, C458 demonstrated the highest efficacy against Aβ toxicity in an MC65 cell-based assay, with EC50=3.59 nM (30-fold lower than CP2, which had an EC50=120 Nm). To evaluate the toxicity of C458 in vivo, 2-month old breeding WT mice were treated with 50 mg/kg of C458 via drinking water. Untreated littermates were used as controls. After one month of treatment, adult and newborn animals were sacrificed and tissue was collected for histological examination. Histology results demonstrated lack of any developmental or tissue pathology, as organs of C458-treated mice were indistinguishable from those of untreated animals. Similarly, no pathological abnormalities were detected in newborn mice conceived by breeding WT mice treated with C458 (50 mg/kg for one month ad libitum in drinking water).
Example 7
Elimination Rate and Half-Life of C458 in Plasma and Brain Tissue
The elimination rate and half-life of C458, measured in plasma and brain, demonstrated good bioavailability of C458, and again suggested that C458 penetrates the blood brain barrier. A rough estimation of elimination rate and half-life of C458 was determined in vivo by delivering a dose of 2.5 mg/kg to each mouse via intrafemoral vein injection. Each group of animals (n=2) was sacrificed at 30 minutes, 1 hour, and 2 hours post injection. Blood and brain tissue was collected, flash frozen, and the concentration of C458 was estimated using a LC-MS/MS assay with a linear calibration curve from 1 ng/ml to 1 ug/ml in both plasma and brain. The concentration of C458 in the brain was 7-8 times higher than in plasma, suggesting that C458 penetrates the blood brain barrier and accumulates in the brain.
For rough estimation of elimination rate and half-life, a one-compartment model and the first rate elimination was assumed. Plotting (Ln) of concentration vs. time provided the elimination rate and half-life of C458 in plasma and the brain (FIG. 10). The estimated half-life of C458 for the first rate elimination (defined as t1/2=1n2/k) in plasma and brain was 48 minutes and 42 minutes, respectively.

<img> id-US20180044295A1-20180215-C00054.TIF </img>
Magnesium turnings (6.2 g, 252.6 mmol, 1.05 equiv.) were suspended in dry tetrahydrofuran (500 mL) in a one liter flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and an N2 inlet. Isopropenyl bromide (5 mL, 57.2 mmol, 0.24 equiv.) and a small iodine crystal (˜1 mm dia.) were added and the mixture was heated to 60° C. The reaction initiated in about fifteen minutes: the heating bath was then turned off and more isopropenyl bromide (16 mL, 182.9 mmol, 0.76 equiv.) was added in 4 mL portions. The vigorous reaction was allowed to subside in between additions. The resulting pale yellow solution of prop-1-en-2-ylmagnesium bromide was allowed to cool to room temperature and used in the next step. The theoretical concentration of the solution is 0.48M. Only a trace of undissolved magnesium remained.

Copper iodide (11.4 g, 60.0 mmol, 0.6 equiv) was slurried in 750 mL dry tetrahydrofuran and chilled in a dry ice-acetone bath. Compound II (0.48M in tetrahydrofuran, 250 mL, 120 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was added dropwise over the course of one hour to the copper iodide slurry while the temperature was kept below −70° C. during the addition. Cyclohexen-1-one (9.6 g, 100.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and chlorotrimethylsilane (15.2 mL, 120.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv) were dissolved in 50 mL dry tetrahydrofuran. The resulting solution was added dropwise over the course of 45 minutes to the chilled alkyl copper slurry. The mixture was stirred for an additional fifteen minutes at which time TLC (30% ethyl acetate/hexane) revealed a mixture of desired product, some unreacted cyclohexen-1-one, and two minor side products. The reaction was quenched with 250 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The cold bath was then removed and the slurry was allowed to warm to approx. 5 C and was poured into a mixture of 50 mL 30% ammonium hydroxide dissolved in 2.5 L of water. The mixture was extracted with 3×1 L ethyl acetate and the aqueous phase discarded. The combined organic phases were washed with 2×1L brine then the aqueous phases were discarded. The organic phase was concentrated to approx. 200 mL under reduced pressure, diluted to approx. 1 L with diethyl ether then dried over sodium sulfate. The solids were removed by filtration and discarded and the mother liquor was concentrated to obtain an orange oil that was purified using a CombiFlash (330 g column, 0-10% ethyl acetate/hexane) to obtain Compound III as a pale yellow oil. Yield: 6.6g (48% from II).

Sodium borohydride (9.7 g, 256.1 mmol, 3.0 equiv) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature and the reaction was determined to be complete after two hours by TLC (30% ethyl acetate/hexane). The reaction was quenched with a minimal amount of 3M aqueous hydrochloric acid until the pH was approx. 2. The solids were filtered and discarded and the mother liquor was concentrated to an oil using a rotary evaporator (25 mm Hg, bath temperature 20° C.). The oil was diluted with 500 mL diethyl ether and dried over sodium sulfate: the solids were removed by filtration and discarded and the mother liquor was concentrated to obtain a yellow oil. The material was combined with a previous batch (14 g scale) and purified using a CombiFlash (330 g column, 0-20% ethyl acetate/hexane) to obtain Compound IV as a pale yellow oil.

The ice bath was removed and the reaction was stirred for fifteen hours at room temperature, then at 40° C. for three hours. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction was diluted with 250 mL diethyl ether and extracted with 2×150 mL saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The combined aqueous phases were back extracted with 150 mL diethyl ether: the aqueous phase was discarded and the combined organics were dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated to obtain a yellow semisolid. At this point the material from both batches was combined and was suspended in 100 mL diethyl ether and allowed to stand overnight. The resulting slurry was diluted with 50 mL diethyl ether and 150 mL hexane, and the solids were removed by filtration and discarded. The mother liquor was concentrated to obtain yellow oil that was split into three portions and purified by CombiFlash (330 g column, 0-15% ethyl acetate/hexane) to obtain 17.4 g pale yellow solid (Compound V).

Example 36
Screening of C458 Analogs Against Aβ Toxicity in MC65 Cells
The C458-like compounds (TABLE 3) were evaluated using Aβ-producing MC65 cells. Several C458 analogs (C594, C596, C600-C603, C607, and C608) demonstrated efficacy against Aβ toxicity comparable to that of CP2 and C458 (FIGS. 11A and 11B).
Example 37
Molecular Mechanism of Action
Using in vitro and in vivo assays, as well as computational chemistry, the molecular mechanism for the action of CP2, C458, and C458 analogs was tested. These studies showed that the first enzymatic complex of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery that produces cellular energy in the form of ATP (Complex I) is a target for new CP2 and C458 analogs.
Since CP2 targets Complex I, experiments were conducted to determine whether the CP2 and C458 analogs also can target Complex I and affect mitochondrial functions such as ATP production, Complex I activity, and NAD+/NADH ratios. ATP production was measured in primary cortical neurons treated with CP2 and four novel CP2 analogs (FIGS. 12A and 12B). Compounds C455, C458 and CP2 modestly reduced ATP production over a concentration range from 10 nM to 5 μM, while C460 and C472 had little or no effect on ATP production. In good agreement, compounds C455, C458, and CP2 also resulted in 20 to 30 percent inhibition of Complex I activity (FIG. 13).
Further, CP2 and C458 analogs, but not an inactive CP2 analog (TP17) or an inactive C458 analog (C599), increased levels of NADH and decreased the NAD+/NADH ratio in primary neurons (Zhang et al., eBioMedicine, 2015). These studies indicated that active compounds targets Complex I activity (FIGS. 14A and 14B), resulting in mild modulation of its activity.
Example 38
Screening of Additional C458 aAalogs Against Aβ toxicity in MC65 Cells
The activity of nine (9) new compounds (C687-C695) was tested in an Aβ toxicity assay in MC65 cells (FIGS. 15A and 15B). The structures of several of these compounds were as follows:
<img> id-US20180044295A1-20180215-C00091.TIF </img>
All of the new compounds, excluding compound C692, demonstrated a lack of toxicity and high efficacy against Aβ toxicity in these cells. Compounds C693-C695 demonstrated much higher efficacy against Aβ toxicity compared to the rest of the compounds (circled in FIG. 15B).
Example 39
Screening of Additional C458 Analogs for Complex I Inhibition and Production of ATP, NAD+, and NADH
To further characterize these nine new compounds, Complex I activity was measured in isolated mitochondria, and levels of ATP, NAD+, and NADH were measured in primary mouse embryonic cortical neurons (FIGS. 16-18). All compounds decreased Complex I activity by 10-25% at 5 μM (FIG. 16). In agreement with the proposed molecular target and the mechanism, all compounds also mildly inhibited ATP production by 15-25% (FIG. 17). Finally, while all of the new compounds increased levels of NADH and decreased the NAD+/NADH ratio (FIGS. 18A-18C), C693 and C694 demonstrated the highest efficacy.
Example 40
Anti-Cancer Activity of Compounds that Modulate Mitochondrial Function
The effect of CP2 and related compounds on cancer was tested in vitro and in vivo. First, CP2 and C458 were tested in WT mice fed a high fat diet (HFD). Two groups of female mice 288 days old (n=10 mice per group) were used; one group was given CP2 (25 mg/kg via drinking water) starting at 288 days of age (FIG. 19). At 320 days of age, CP2-treated and untreated mice were put on HFD (60%) for 94 days. After that, both groups were on 42% HFD for 272 days (until the age of 686 days). Within this period of time, most of the untreated WT mice developed different types of tumors (breast, liver, and abdominal tumors), and 90% of the untreated WT mice died. In contrast, the CP2-treated mice did not develop tumors, and demonstrated increased rates of survival (FIG. 19). Thus, these experiments suggested that CP2 may prevent the development of cancer.
To further test this hypothesis, various cancer cell lines were treated with different doses (5 μM or 50 μM) of CP2 or compounds C455, C460, C472, or C594, and cell death was evaluated using an MTT assay. The following human cell lines were used: HeLa (cervical cancer, FIG. 20A); Pancl (pancreatic cancer, FIG. 20B); P-WT MEFs (control, FIG. 20C), P++ MEFs (accelerated aging phenotype, FIG. 20D) p53−/− ms TCL (FIG. 20E); Patu (pancreatic cancer, FIG. 20F), and Su (pancreatic cancer, FIG. 20G). The compounds had varying effects on the different cell lines, but in general they suppressed growth of the cancer cell lines tested-particularly at the higher dose. The compounds did not affect the survival of WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts (FIG. 20C), but they did suppress the growth of MEFs that were P++ (FIG. 20D).
Additional dose response studies were conducted in the same cell lines using CP2; the results are plotted in FIGS. 21A-21H as follows: FIG. 21A, HeLa cervical cancer cells; FIG. 21B, Pancl pancreatic cancer cells; FIG. 21C, P-WT: MEFs; control); FIG. 21D, P++: MEFs; FIG. 21E, p53−/− ms TCL; FIG. 21F, Patu pancreatic cancer cells; FIG. 21G, Su pancreatic cancer cells; FIG. 21H, HPDE control.
Taken together, the data obtained in vivo in WT mice (HFD) and in vitro demonstrated that CP2 and related compounds can prevent the development of tumors and suppress the survival of multiple cancer cell lines.
