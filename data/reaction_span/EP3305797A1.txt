Sector of the technique
This invention is primarily directed at the pharmaceutical sector with applications for the prevention and/or treatment of diseases and any type of condition or damage involving substance P (SP), or which, although not it is yet involved, proceeds via the NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptor.
Prior state of the art
SP (FIG. 1), neurokinin A (NKA) and neurokinin B (NKB) are mammal tachykinins that act as both neurotransmitters and neuromodulators [Nakanishi, S. Annu Rev Neurosci. 1991, 14, 123]. These peptides exercise their biological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) by binding to their receptors bound to G, NK1, NK2 and NK3 proteins [Quatara, L.; Maggi, C. A. Neuropeptides, 1998, 32, 1].
In particular, the NK1 receptor (NK1R), the cognate receptor of SP and the most abundant of the tachykinins in the mammalian CNS, is present in areas of the brain involved in the regulation of affective behaviour and the mediation of anxiety, stress and depression [Leroy, V.; Mauser, P.; Gao, Z.; Peet, N. P. Neurokinin Receptor Antagonists. Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs 2000, 9, 735-746].
The observation that SP release is associated with various psychopathological processes means that the NK1 receptor is currently a highly relevant therapeutic target [(a) Bremer, A.A. and Leeman, S.E. (January 2010) Substance P. In: Encyclopedia of Life Sciences (ELS). John Wiley & Sons, Ltd: Chichester. DOI: 10.1002/9780470015902.a0000206.pub2 (b) Rupniak, N.M.J.; Kramer, M. S. Substance P and related tachykininis. Neuropsychopharmacology. The Fifth Generation of Progress. 2002. Lippincott, Williams, & Wilkins (Ed. Davis, K.L.; Charney, D.; Coyle, J.T.; Nemeroff, C.)].
Consequently, NK1 receptor antagonists are currently being considered as potential therapeutic agents for a large number of pathologies such as migraine, [Moskowitz, M. A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992, 13, 307-311] rheumatoid arthritis, [Lotz, M.; Carson, D. A.; Vaughan, J. H. Science 1987, 235, 893-895] astha, inflammatory bowel disease, emesis, [Dando, T: M.; Perry, C. M. DRUGS, 2004, 64, 777-794], el cancer [Folkers, K.; Feng, D. M.; Asano, N.; Hakanson, R.; Wiesenfeld-Hallin, Z.; Leander, S. Spantide II, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87, 4833-4835], as well as central nervous system disorders such as anxiety, Parkinson's disease and depression [Quartara, L.; Altamura, M. Curr. Drug Targets 2006, 7, 975-992].
Recent data indicating that NK1 receptor antagonists exert significant anticancer activity are of particular interest [(a) Muñoz, M.; Rosso, M.; Pérez, A.; Coveñas, R.; Rosso, R.; Zamarriego, C; Piruat, J.I. Neuropeptides, 2005, 39, 427. (b) Muñoz, M.; Pérez, A.; Rosso, M.; Zamarriego, C.; Rosso, R. Melanoma Res. 2004, 14, 183. (c) Esteban, F.; Muñoz, M.; Gonzalez-Moles, M.A.; Rosso, M. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2006, 25, 137]. In this regard, the anticancer activity of the NK1 receptor antagonists turns out to be very broad spectrum, allowing the treatment of human melanoma, neuroblastoma, human Hodgkin's lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, human rhabdomyosarcoma, human Burkitt's lymphoma, human lung carcinoma, human Edwing's sarcoma, human glioma, human osteosarcoma, malignant human gangliomas, human invasive malignant melanoma, human metastatic melanoma cells and human breast cancer among others [Muñoz, M. Use of non-peptide NK1 receptor antagonists for the production of apoptosis in tumour cells. Patent application number: PCT/ES2005/000068]. In this regard, it is important to highlight that it has recently been shown that the NK1 receptor is highly over-expressed in a large number of aggressive tumours, [(a) Hennig, I. M.; Laissue, J. A.; Horisberger, U.; Reubi, J. C. Int. J. Cancer 1995, 61, 786. (b) Singh, D.; et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000, 97, 388] in particular in glioma, astrocytomas and glioblastomas, [(a) Palma, C.; Maggi, C.A. Life Sci. 2000, 67, 985-1001. (b) Lai, J. P., Douglas, S. D., Wang, Y. J.; Ho, W. Z. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 2005, 12, 537-541], where the level of expression correlates with the degree of malignancy [Yamaguchi, K.; Richardson, M. D.; Bigner, D. D.; Kwata, M. M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2005, 56, 585].
The first designs of NK1 receptor antagonists based on the structure of SP have given rise to compounds with a peptide structure with low affinities and poor metabolic stabilities [(a) Enberg, G.; Svensson, T. H.; Rosell, S.; Folkers, K. Nature 1981, 293, 222. (b) Folkers, K., Hakanson, R.; Horig, J.; Jie-Cheng, X.; Leander, S.. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1984, 83, 449. (c) Folkers, K.; Feng, D. M.; Asano, N.; Hakanson, R.; Wiesenfeld-Hallin, Z.; Leander, S. Spantide II. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1990, 87, 4833]. The discovery at the start of the 90s in the last century of the first non-peptide antagonist of the NK1 receptors, CP-96345 [Snider, R. M.; Constantine, J. W.; John A. Lowe, J. A.; Kelly P. Longo, K. P.; Lebel, W. S.; Woody, H. A.; Drozda, S. E.; Desai, M. C.; Vinick, F. J. Robin W. Spencer, R. W.; Hess. H.-J. Science 1991, 251, 435] has driven research in this area, not only in the academic field, but also at the industrial level, with nearly all the major pharmaceutical companies working in this field with the aim of identifying selective and potent NK1 R antagonists [(a) Giardina, G. A.; Gagliardi, S.; Martinelli, M. IDrugs, 2003, 6, 758. (b) Huang, S.-C.; Korlipara, V. L. Exp. Pat. Opin. Ther. Pat. 2010, 20, 1019-1045]. More than two decades of extensive synthetic and economic effort has yielded the discovery of a considerable number of structurally diverse NK1 receptor antagonists, although none of them with the desired therapeutic success.
Currently, there is only one NK1 receptor antagonist on the market, Aprepitant (Merck), prescribed for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, [Sankhala, K.K.; Pandya, D.M.; Sarantopoulos, J.; Soefje, S.A.; Giles, F.J.; Chawla, S.P. Exp. Opin. Drug Metbol. Toxicol. 2009, 5, 1607]. The main reason for this is that the exact structure of the NK1 receptor, which belongs to the structurally complex superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, [(a) Kobilka, B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2013, 52, 6380. (b) Lefkowitz, R. J. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2013, 52, 6367] is still unknown. Therefore, the design and synthesis of new non-peptide molecules with a high affinity for the NK1 receptor, and preferably with a chemical structure different from known NK1 receptor antagonists, is an important area in modern medical chemistry.

EXAMPLE 6. Antagonistic activity of the NK1 receptors of the synthesised carbohydrate derivatives.
The capacity of the synthesised carbohydrate derivatives to modulate the NK1 receptor has been determined experimentally through the Ip-one assay and affinity studies through the displacement of marked SP ([125I]BH-SP).
6.1. Results obtained.
6.1.1. IP-One assay results: The results of the NK1 receptor antagonist activity study are shown as an example, the results are for the IP-One assay on synthesised carbohydrate derivatives 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 along with the commercial antagonists L-732,138 and CP-96345 (the first non-peptide NK1 antagonist), which have been used as a reference. SP was used as a positive control in the test.
All the compounds tested antagonise SP through the NK1 receptor. We highlight the results for derivatives 2, 4 and 5, which are excellent inhibitors of SP activity, with very similar Kinact values to those of the reference antagonist (FIG. 2 and 3):Kact SP: 1.64E-08 ± 0.62 M; Kinact L-732,138: 8.37E-08 ± 2.63 M; Kinact CP-96345: 3.65E-09 ± 0.55 M; Kinact 2: 2.37E-07 ± 1.16 M; Kinact 4: 7.37E-07 ± 2.71 M; Kinact 5: 5.60E-07 ± 0.53 M
Of all the derivatives, derivative 2 showed the greatest antagonist activity.The inhibition percentages were obtained at a ligand concentration of 10-6M (FIG. 4):L-732,138: 69% SP inhibition; Derivative 3: 60% SP inhibition; Derivative 6: 48% SP inhibition.
6.1.2. Results of the marked SP displacement study. The affinity of synthesised carbohydrate derivatives 2, 4, 5 and 8 are shown as an example.

The compounds show have a greater affinity for the NK1 receptors than SP.
6.2. General procedure for determining the antagonist activity of NK1 receptors.
6.2.1. Ip-one assay:
Cell culture and transfection. The cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Virginia, USA). The culture media, foetal bovine serum (FBS) and additives were supplied by Invitrogen.
The CHO cells were cultured on a Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with a 10% FBS supplement, penicillin/streptomycin, 100U/ml and L-glutamine 2 mM at 37°C in a humid atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Non-essential amino acids were also added to the medium (Invitrogen).
Transient transfection of the cell lines was carried out by electroporation in a volume of 300 µL with a total of 10 µg DNA (pRK5 Neo-NK1 wild type) plasmid (using up to 500 ng of pRK5como carrier DNA to achieve 10 µg) and with 107 cells in the electroporation buffer (50 mM K2HPO4, 20 mM CH3COOK, 20 mM KOH and 26 mM MgSO4, pH 7.4). After electroporation (280 V, 1mF, GeneZapper 450/2500; IBI, New Haven, Connecticut, USA), the cells were suspended in a complete medium and seeded on well culture plates with a density of 105 per well. The 96-well culture plates were first covered with polyornithine diluted in PBS, then incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes and they were then washed with PBS before being seeded.
ELISA. The cells were transfected with pRK5-NK1-6His to measure the expression of the transfected receptors. The cells were fixed 24 hours after electroporation using paraformaldehyde at 4% in PBS for 5 minutes and washed 3 times with PBS. A 30-minute block was carried out with PBS and 1% unsupplemented FBS before incubation with the anti-6 His primary antibody (0.5 µg/ml) for 30 minutes. The cells were then washed three times with PBS + 1% FBS for 5 minutes and incubated for 30 minutes with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1/1000; Amersham, Orsay,France). The cells were then washed three times with PBS + 1% FBS and three times with PBS. Then 60 µl of PBS and 20 µl of Supersignal ELISA Femto (Perbio-Pierce, Brebières, France) were added to the wells. The luminescence was read using a Wallac Victor2 (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Courtaboeuf, France).
Second Messenger accumulation (IP1). The activation and inhibition of the route of the IP by the NK1 receptor agonists and antagonists, respectively, was determined using the dynamic IP-One kit (Cisbio Bioassays, Bagnols-sur-Cèze, France). After transfection, 105 cells were distributed in 100 µl of a complete medium into a 96-well assay plate (Greiner Bio-One, Courtaboeuf, France). After 24 hours, the medium was eliminated and replaced by 40 µl of an incubation medium that contained the agonist and/or antagonist in an appropriate concentration. The homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (HTRF-FRET) assay was performed as indicated in the literature (Maurel, D.; Kniazeff, J.; Mathis, G.; Tinquet, E.; Pin, J.P.; Ansanay, H. Anal Biochem. 2004, 329, 253). the inhibitory effect of the non-peptidic NK1 antagonist in SP-induced IP1 accumulation was studied in the same way as Arunlakshana and Schild (1959) (Arunlakshana, or.;) Schild, H.O. Br J Pharmacol. 1959, 14, 48). The 10 minute preincubation was followed by a 30 minute incubation with the antagonist and SP.
Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of the differences between the experimental groups was determined by one-way or two-way variance analysis followed by a post-hoc Duncan multiple-rank test to perform pairwise comparisons between the means. The Student t test was also used.
6.2.2. Displacement of marked Substance P:
A marked SP concentration of 0.15 nM was used for the displacement studies and the concentration of the products of the invention was 10-6 M. The incubation time was 60 minutes at room temperature and the reference ligand used was [Sar9, Met(O2)11]-SP with IC50=0.29 nM (Heuillet, E. J. Neurochem. 1993, 60, 868-876).
EXAMPLE 7. Selective anticancer activity of the new carbohydrate derivative NK1 antagonists.
7.1. Results obtained.
By way of example, the results are shown for the anticancer activity in lung cancer studies for derivatives 1, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10. Two commercial NK1 antagonists, CP-96345 and Aprepitant, were used as a reference. The reference drug cisplatin, used in therapy to treat lung cancer, was used as a positive control.
The IC50 was determined in all cases through the MTT test, both for cancerous lung cells (A549) as well as in healthy lung cells (MRC-5) to determine the selectivity of the compounds. The following table shows the IC50 values for the MRC-5 and A549 cell lines corresponding to cisplatin.

All of our compounds not only showed a clear anticancer activity, they were also selective for lung cancer cells, unlike the commercial NK-1 antagonists Aprepitant and CP-96345. Among all of them, we would highlight the derivative 7, which had a selectivity far superior to the others. All the derivatives except derivative 8 showed greater activity against the cancer line than Aprepitant and CP-96345. The most active derivatives were 1, 2 and 5.
According to these results, the activity and selectivity of our derivative 2 matches those of cisplatin. Anticancer activity studies were, therefore, carried out with ligand 2 on other cell lines.
The possible anticancer activity of compound 2 was evaluated in a total of three in-vitro cancer models: breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma. In all three models, this compound was shown to be more cytotoxic to cancer cells than to normal cells. This selectivity was observed from the lowest concentrations tested and over a range of concentrations, we can, therefore, conclude that this compound presents selective cytotoxic activity. Specifically, it has proved to be 4, 6, and 12 times more selective for melanoma, lung and breast cancer cells respectively, with respect to the corresponding normal cells.
The following table shows the IC50 values for cell line MCF7 (human breast adenocarcinoma cells) and MCF10 (non-malignant human breast cells) as well as UACC-62 (human melanoma cells) and VH-10 lines (non-malignant human skin cells) for compound 2.

7.2. General procedure for the determination of selective anticancer activity for the new NK1 receptor antagonists.
Cell lines. A549 human cells from lung adenocarcinoma, MRC5 non-malignant human lung cells and UACC-62 human melanoma cells were obtained from the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC). MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells and MCF10 human non-malignant breast cells were generously provided by Dr Ruano and Dr Daza (University of Seville, Spain). VH-10 non-malignant human skin cells were generously provided by Dr Helleday (Karolinska Institute, Sweden).All the culture media used were supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 50 µg/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. An exception was the medium used for the cultivation of MCF10 cells which was a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and HAM's F12 media supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 50 µg/ml penicillin, 50 µg/ml streptomycin, 20 ng/ml growth factors, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 µg/ml insulin, 500 ng/ml hydrocortisone and 5% horse serum.
All the cell lines were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and controlled humidity in an incubator.
All the products used for the cell culture were obtained from the PAA laboratory, with the exception of the media for the MCF10 cell line which was provided by Dr Navarro.
Cell viability assay. The cells were exposed to the compounds for 48 hours. After the treatment, the media were withdrawn and cells were incubated for 3-5 hours with 125 µl MTT (1 mg/ml MTT in culture medium). Then, 80 µl 20% SDS in 0.02 M HCl was added to solubilise the formazan-MTT crystals and the plates were incubated overnight in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Finally, the plates were read using a plate reader spectrophotometer at 540 nm. The absorbance was directly proportional to cell viability, which is expressed as a percentage relative to the control. All the results were obtained from at least three independent experiments and expressed as mean ± the standard error of the mean (SEM).
