TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel diazadienyl compound, a raw material for forming a thin film that includes the compound, a method for manufacturing a thin film by using the raw material for forming a thin film, and a novel diazadiene compound.
BACKGROUND ART
Thin-film materials including a metal element have been used for a variety of applications because such materials exhibit electric properties, optical properties and the like. For example, copper and copper-containing thin films have been used as wiring materials for LSI because of a high electric conductivity, high resistance to electromigration, and a high melting point. Further, nickel and nickel-containing thin films are mainly used for parts of electronic components such as resistive films and barrier films, parts for recording media such as magnetic films, and parts for thin-film solar cells, such as electrodes. Cobalt and cobalt-containing thin films have been used for electrode films, resistive films, adhesive films, magnetic tapes, ultra-hard tool members and the like.
Examples of methods for manufacturing such thin films include a sputtering method, an ion plating method, a Metal Organic Decomposition method (MOD method) using a coating pyrolysis method and a sol-gel method, and a chemical vapor deposition method. Among them, the chemical vapor deposition (referred to hereinbelow simply as CVD) method, inclusive of an ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition) method, is an optimum manufacturing process because it has advantages such as being suitable for mass production, exceling in composition controllability and stepwise coating ability, and enabling hybrid accumulation.
A large number of various materials have been reported as metal-supplying sources for use in the chemical vapor deposition method. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a diazadienyl complex that can be used as a raw material for forming a thin film by an ALD method. Further, Patent Document 2 discloses a diazadiene-based metal compound that can be used in a chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition. Patent Documents 1 and 2 do not specifically describe a diazadiene compound of the present invention.Patent Document 1: U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2013/0164456Patent Document 2: Japanese Patent Application Laid-open No. 2013-545755

The diazadienyl compound of the present invention is not particularly restricted by the manufacturing method thereof and can be manufactured by using a well-known reaction. For example, a diazadienyl compound of cobalt can be manufactured, for example, by a method of conducting a reaction of an inorganic cobalt salt such as halide and nitrate, or a hydrate thereof with the corresponding diazadiene compound in the presence of a base such as sodium, lithium, sodium hydride, sodium amide, sodium hydroxide, sodium methylate, ammonia, and amine, or a method of conducting a reaction of an inorganic cobalt salt such as halide and nitrate, or a hydrate thereof with a sodium complex, lithium complex, potassium complex or the like of the corresponding diazadiene compound.
In addition, the diazadiene compound used here is not particularly restricted by the manufacturing method thereof and can be manufactured by using a well-known reaction. For example, a diazadiene compound used for manufacturing a diazadienyl compound in which R3 is hydrogen can be obtained by reacting an alkylamine and an alkylglyoxal in a solvent such as trichloromethane to obtain a product and extracting it with a suitable solvent, followed by dehydration treatment. Further, a diazadiene compound used for manufacturing a diazadienyl compound in which R3 is a C1-6 linear or branched alkyl group can be obtained by reacting an alkylamine and a diketone (R2-C(═O)C(═O)-R3) in a solvent such as trichloromethane to obtain a product and extracting it with a suitable solvent, followed by dehydration treatment.
The raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention includes the diazadienyl compound of the present invention, which has been explained hereinabove, as a precursor for the thin film, and the form of the raw material differs depending on the manufacturing process in which the raw material for forming a thin film is to be used. For example, when a thin film including only a metal of one type or silicon is manufactured, the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention does not include metal compounds or semimetal compounds other than the diazadienyl compound. Meanwhile, where a thin film including metals and/or semimetals of two or more types is manufactured, the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention includes, in addition to the abovementioned diazadienyl compound, a compound including the desired metal and/or a compound including the desired semimetal (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “other precursor”). As will be described hereinbelow, the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention may additionally include an organic solvent and/or a nucleophilic reagent. Since physical properties of the diazadienyl compound serving as the precursor are advantageous for the CVD method and ALD method, the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention is particularly useful as a raw material for chemical vapor deposition (referred to hereinbelow as “CVD”).
Where the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention is a raw material for chemical vapor deposition, the form thereof can be selected, as appropriate, according, e.g., to the delivery and feed method in the CVD method which is to be used.
The delivery and feed method can be a gas delivery method in which a CVD source is vaporized by heating and/or depressurizing the interior of a container in which the source is stored (can be referred to hereinbelow simply as “raw material container”), and the obtained vapor is introduced, optionally together with a carrier gas such as argon, nitrogen, and helium, into a film formation chamber in which a substrate is disposed (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “deposition reaction unit”) or a liquid delivery method in which a CVD source is transported in a state of a liquid or solution into a vaporization chamber and vaporized by heating and/or depressurizing in the vaporization chamber, and the vapor is introduced into a film formation chamber. When the gas delivery method is used, the diazadienyl compound itself, which is represented by General Formula (I), can be used as the CVD source. When the liquid delivery method is used, the diazadienyl compound itself, which is represented by General Formula (I), or a solution obtained by dissolving the compound in an organic solvent can be used as the CVD source. Those CVD sources may additionally include the other precursor, a nucleophilic reagent or the like.
Further, CVD of a multicomponent system can be implemented by a method of vaporizing and feeding CVD sources for each component independently (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “single source method”) and a method of vaporizing and feeding a mixed raw material obtained by mixing in advance multicomponent raw materials at the desired composition ratio (can be also referred to hereinbelow as “cocktail source method”). When the cocktail source method is used, a mixture of the diazadienyl compound of the present invention and the other precursor, or a mixed solution obtained by dissolving the mixture in an organic solvent can be used as the CVD source. The mixture or mixed solvent may additionally include a nucleophilic reagent.
The organic solvent is not particularly limited, and well-known typical organic solvents can be used. Examples of the organic solvents include acetates such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and methoxyethyl acetate; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, dibutyl ether, and dioxane; ketones such as methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, cyclohexanone, and methylcyclohexanone; hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, dimethylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexane, heptane, octane, toluene, and xylene; hydrocarbons including a cyano group such as 1-cyanopropane, 1-cyanobutane, 1-cyanohexane, cyanocyclohexane, cycanobenzene, 1,3-dicyanopropane, 1,4-dicyanobutane, 1,6-dicyanohexane, 1,4-dicyanocyclohexane, and 1,4-dicyanobenzene; pyridine and lutidine. Such organic solvents are used individually or as mixed solvents of two or more thereof according to the relationship between the solute solubility, usage temperature, boiling point, and flash point. When such organic solvents are used, the amount of the entire precursor in the CVD source which is a solvent in which the precursor is dissolved in the organic solvent is preferably 0.01 mol/L to 2.0 mol/L, in particular, 0.05 mol/L to 1.0 mol/L. The amount of the entire precursor, as referred to herein, is the amount of the diazadienyl compound of the present invention when the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention does not include a metal compound or a semimetal compound other than the diazadienyl compound of the present invention, and is the total amount of the diazadienyl compound of the present invention and the other precursor when the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention includes a compound including other metal and/or a compound including a semimetal in addition to the diazadienyl compound.
When CVD of a multicomponent system is performed, the other precursor which is used together with the diazadienyl compound of the present invention is not particularly limited, and any well-known typical precursor which has been used in CVD sources can be used.
Examples of the other precursor include one, or two or more compounds of silicon or a metal selected from a group including compounds having a hydride, a hydroxide, a halide, an azide, an alkyl, an alkenyl, a cycloalkyl, an aryl, an alkynyl, an amino, a dialkylaminoalkyl, a monoalkylamino, a dialkylamino, a diamine, a di(silyl-alkyl)amino, a di(alkyl-silyl)amino, a disilylamino, an alkoxy, an alkoxyalkyl, a hydrazido, a phosphido, a nitrile, a dialkylaminoalkoxy, an alkoxyalkyldialkylamino, a siloxy, a diketonate, a cyclopentadienyl, a silyl, a pyrazolate, a guanidinate, a phosphoguanidinate, an amidinate, a phosphoamidinate, a ketoiminate, a diketoiminate, a carbonyl, and a phosphoamidinate as a ligand.
Examples of metals for the precursor include magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, radium, scandium, yttrium, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, manganese, iron, osmium, cobalt, rhodium, iridium, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, zinc, cadmium, aluminum, gallium, indium, germanium, tin, lead, antimony, bismuth, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, holmium, erbium, thulium, and ytterbium.
Such other precursors are well known in the pertinent technical field, and the manufacturing methods thereof are also well known. For example, where an alcohol compound is used as the organic ligand, the precursor can be manufactured by conducting a reaction of the abovementioned inorganic metal salt or a hydrate thereof and the alkali metal alkoxide of the alcohol compound. Examples of the inorganic metal salt and hydrate thereof include metal halides and nitrates, and examples of the alkali metal alkoxides include sodium alkoxide, lithium alkoxide, and potassium alkoxide.
In the case of a single source method, it is preferred that the other precursor be a compound demonstrating thermal and/or oxidative decomposition behavior similar to that of the diazadienyl compound of the present invention. In the case of a cocktail source method, it is preferred that the other precursor be a compound demonstrating similar thermal and/or oxidative decomposition behavior and further demonstrating no transformations induced by chemical reactions or the like at the time of mixing.

A method for manufacturing a thin film of the present invention by which a thin film is manufactured by using the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention is based on the CVD method in which a vapor produced by vaporizing the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention, and an optionally used reactive gas are introduced into a film formation chamber in which a substrate is disposed, and the precursor is then decomposed and/or chemically reacted on the substrate to grow and deposit a thin film including a metal on the substrate surface. The method for delivering and feeding the raw materials, the deposition method, manufacturing conditions, and manufacturing apparatus are not particularly restricted, and well-known typical conditions and methods can be used.
Examples of the optionally used reactive gas include oxidative gases such as oxygen, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, water vapor, hydrogen peroxide, formic acid, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride; reductive gases such as hydrogen; and gases producing nitrides, for example, organic amine compounds such as monoalkylamines, dialkylamines, trialkylamines, and alkylenediamines, hydrazine, and ammonia. These gases can be used individually or in combinations of two or more thereof.
Examples of the delivery and feeding methods include the above-described gas delivery method, liquid delivery method, single source method, and cocktail source method.
Examples of the deposition method include thermal CVD in which a source gas or a source gas and a reactive gas are reacted only by heat in order to deposit a thin film; plasma CVD in which heat and plasma are used; photo-excited CVD in which heat and light are used; photo- and plasma-excited CVD in which heat, light and plasma are used; and ALD in which the CVD deposition reaction is separated into elementary steps and deposition is performed step by step at a molecular level.
Examples of the substrate material include silicon, ceramics such as silicon nitride, titanium nitride, tantalum nitride, titanium oxide, titanium nitride ruthenium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, and lanthanum oxide; glass; and metals such as metallic ruthenium.

The manufacturing conditions include the reaction temperature (substrate temperature), reaction pressure, deposition rate, and the like. The reaction temperature is preferably 100° C. or higher, at which the diazadienyl compound of the present invention is sufficiently reactive, and more preferably 150° C. to 400° C. Since the diazadienyl compound of the present invention can be thermally decomposed at a temperature lower than 250° C., a temperature of 150° C. to 250° C. is especially desirable. The reaction pressure is preferably from atmospheric pressure to 10 Pa for thermal CVD and photo-excited CVD, and preferably from 2000 Pa to 10 Pa when plasma is used.
The deposition rate can be controlled by the raw material feed conditions (vaporization temperature and vaporization pressure), reaction temperature, and reaction pressure. Since a high deposition rate can degrade the properties of the resulting thin film and a low deposition rate can cause problems with productivity, the deposition rate is preferably 0.01 nm/min to 100 nm/min and more preferably 1 nm/min to 50 nm/min. In the ALD method, the control is performed by the number of cycles so as to obtain the desired film thickness.
The temperature or pressure during vaporization of the raw material for forming a thin film can be also considered as the manufacturing condition. The step of obtaining the vapor by vaporizing the raw material for forming a thin film may be performed inside the raw material container or inside the vaporization chamber. In either case, it is preferred that the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention be evaporated at 0° C. to 150° C. Further, where the raw material for forming a thin film is vaporized to obtain the vapor inside the raw material container or vaporization chamber, it is preferred that the pressure inside the raw material container and the pressure inside the vaporization chamber be 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa.
The method for manufacturing a thin film of the present invention, when it is realized by the ALD method, may include a raw material introduction step in which the raw material for forming a thin film is vaporized to obtain a vapor and the vapor is introduced into the film formation chamber by the abovementioned delivery and feeding method, and also a precursor thin film formation step of forming a precursor thin film on the surface of the substrate with the diazadienyl compound in the vapor, an evacuation step of evacuating the unreacted diazadienyl compound gas, and a metal-containing thin film formation step of chemically reacting the precursor thin film with a reactive gas and forming a thin film including the metal on the surface of the substrate.
Each of the abovementioned steps will be described hereinbelow in greater detail with reference to the case of forming a metal oxide thin film. When a metal oxide thin film is formed by the ALD method, initially, the raw material introduction step, which has been explained hereinabove, is performed. The temperature and pressure preferred when vaporizing the raw material for forming a thin film are the same as explained hereinabove. Then, a precursor thin film is formed on the substrate surface with the diazadienyl compound introduced in the deposition reaction unit (precursor thin film formation step). At this time, heat may be applied by heating the substrate or heating the deposition reaction unit. The precursor thin film which is formed in this step is a metal oxide thin film or a thin film generated by decomposition and/or reaction of part of the diazadienyl compound and has a composition different from the target metal oxide thin film. The substrate temperature employed in this step is preferably from room temperature to 500° C., more preferably from 150° C. to 350° C. The pressure in the system (in the film formation chamber) when this step is performed is preferably 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa, more preferably 10 Pa to 1000 Pa.
The unreacted diazadienyl compound gas and byproduct gas are then evacuated from the deposition reaction unit (evacuation step). The unreacted diazadienyl compound gas and byproduct gas are ideally completely evacuated from the deposition reaction unit, but such complete evacuation is not always necessary. Examples of the evacuation method include a method of purging the interior of the system with an inactive gas such as nitrogen, helium, and argon, a method of evacuating by depressurizing the interior of the system, and a method in which the aforementioned methods are combined. The degree of depressurization when the depressurization method is used is preferably 0.01 Pa to 300 Pa, more preferably 0.01 Pa to 100 Pa.
The reactive gas is then introduced into the deposition reaction unit and a metal oxide thin film is formed from the precursor thin film, which has been formed in the preceding precursor thin film formation step, under the action of the oxidizing gas or the action of the oxidizing gas and heat (metal oxide-containing thin film formation step). The temperature when heat is used in this step is preferably from room temperature to 500° C., more preferably from 150° C. to 350° C. The pressure in the system (in the film formation chamber) in which this step is performed is preferably 1 Pa to 10,000 Pa, more preferably 10 Pa to 1000 Pa. The diazadienyl compound of the present invention has good reactivity with oxidizing gases and can yield a metal oxide thin film.
When the ALD method is used in the above-described manner in the method for manufacturing a thin film of the present invention, thin film deposition performed by a series of operations including the raw material introduction step, precursor thin film formation step, evacuation step, and metal oxide-containing thin film formation step may be taken as one cycle, and such cycles may be repeated a plurality of times till a thin film of a necessary thickness is obtained. In this case, after one cycle is completed, it is preferred that the unreacted diazadienyl compound gas, reactive gas (oxidizing gas when a metal oxide thin film is formed), and byproduct gas be evacuated from the deposition reaction unit in the same manner as in the evacuation step, and the next cycle be thereafter performed.
When a metal oxide thin film is formed by the ALD method, energy such as plasma, light, and voltage may be applied, and a catalyst may be used. The time period for applying the energy and the time period for using the catalyst are not particularly limited. For example, the energy may be applied and the catalyst may be used when the diazadienyl compound gas is introduced in the raw material introduction step, during heating in the precursor thin film formation step or metal oxide-containing thin film formation step, during evacuation of the interior of the system in the evacuation step, when the oxidizing gas is introduced in the metal oxide-containing thin film formation step, and also between the aforementioned steps.
Further, in the method for manufacturing a thin film of the present invention, annealing may be performed under an inactive gas atmosphere, an oxidizing atmosphere, or a reducing atmosphere after the thin film deposition to obtain better electric properties, and a reflow step may be employed when bump embedding is needed. In this case, the temperature is 200° C. to 1000° C., preferably 250° C. to 500° C.
A well-known chemical vapor deposition apparatus can be used for manufacturing a thin film by using the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention. Specific examples of suitable apparatuses include an apparatus, such as depicted in FIG. 1, in which a precursor can be fed by bubbling, and an apparatus, such as depicted in FIG. 2, which has a vaporization chamber. An apparatus can be also used in which, as depicted in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, plasma treatment can be performed with respect to a reactive gas. The single-substrate apparatuses, such as depicted in FIG. 1 to FIG. 4, are not limiting, and an apparatus which uses a batch furnace and is capable of simultaneous processing of a large number of substrates can be also used.
Where a thin film is manufactured using the raw material for forming a thin film of the present invention, the desired type of thin film such as metal, oxide ceramic, nitride ceramic, and glass can be formed by appropriately selecting the other precursor, reactive gas, and manufacturing conditions. Such thin films are known to exhibit various electric properties, optical properties and the like, and are used for a variety of applications. For example, copper and copper-containing thin films have been used as wiring materials for LSI because of a high electric conductivity, high resistance to electromigration, and a high melting point. Further, nickel and nickel-containing thin films are mainly used for parts of electronic components such as resistive films and barrier films, parts for recording media such as magnetic films, and parts for thin-film solar cells, such as electrodes. Cobalt and cobalt-containing thin films have been used for electrode films, resistive films, adhesive films, magnetic tapes, ultra-hard tool members and the like.

It can be seen from Table 1 above that while Comparative Example 1 is a compound with a melting point of 171° C., the Evaluation Examples 1-1 to 1-4 are all compounds that are liquid under conditions of normal pressure, 30° C. Since a raw material for forming a thin film having a low melting point is easy to transport, such a raw material for forming a thin film can improve productivity. Further, the TG-DTA results show that Evaluation Examples 1-1 to 1-4 have lower 50% mass reduction temperatures than Comparative Example 1. This shows that Evaluation Examples 1-1 to 1-4 exhibit better vapor pressure than Comparative Example 1. Particularly, it is found that Evaluation Examples 1-1 and 1-4 show particularly excellent vapor pressures.
