Technical Field
The present invention relates to novel cyclic compounds having a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signal inhibitory action useful as preventive and therapeutic drugs of autoimmune disease and/or inflammatory disease or diseases such as chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CINP), liver injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and the like, and use thereof.
[Background of the Invention]
TLR4 was initially discovered as a receptor which recognizes lipopolysaccharide of Gram negative bacteria and activates the natural immunity system. However, in recent years, it has been elucidated that not only does TLR4 activate such natural immunity reactions for preventing infections, but also recognizes various endogenous ligands produced in said various diseases and activates various cells playing central roles in the said diseases. Moreover, it has been reported that expression of TLR4 is accentuated in lesions of various diseases and that onset and progression of diseases in disease model animals are markedly suppressed in TLR4 knockout mouse and mutant mouse. Accordingly, it is suggested that TLR4 plays an important role in autoimmune disease and/or inflammatory disease, and diseases such as cardiac disease, renal disease, liver disease, central nervous system disease, infectious disease, malignant tumor, sepsis, septic shock and the like.
In addition to such diseases, the relationship to ischemia-reperfusion injury (ischemia reperfusion injury: IRI) caused by reperfusion of blood flow to organs and tissues in ischemic condition upon organ transplantation and the like, is also reported. High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB-1), which is one of TLR4 endogenous ligands, increases in transplanted organ. Moreover, the transplanted organ derived from donor with genetically impaired TLR4 function shows resistance to IRI-associated dysfunction. From such publicly known knowledge, it is suggested that TLR4 signal due to HMGB-1 plays an important role in IRI (Non-Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 2).
As a result, TLR4 signaling inhibitors (may also be called "TLR4 inhibitors") are anticipated to be preventive and therapeutic drugs of autoimmune disease and/or inflammatory disease or diseases such as cardiac disease, renal disease, liver disease, central nervous system disease, infectious disease, malignant tumor, sepsis, septic shock, etc.

The cells were adjusted to 2x106 cells/mL using RPM1-1640 culture medium (phenol red free) supplemented with 10 % inactivated bovine fetal serum, and were plated on 384 well plate so as to contain 6x104 cells/30 µL per well. Thereafter the cells were cultured at 37°C overnight under 5% CO2/95% air. The test compound dissolved in DMSO was diluted 200 times using RPM1-1640 culture medium and adjusted so as to form a compound concentration of 500 nM. The prepared test compound 10 µL (final concentration 100 nM) was added to the cells, and LPS (Sigma) and mouse interferon γ (Wako Pure Chemicals) were added in amounts of 10 µL so as to form final concentrations of 1.25ng/mL and 0.2 ng/mL respectively. The cells were further cultured overnight, and then the nitrite ion (stable NO metabolite) concentration in the culture supernatant was measured as an index of NO production. The nitrite ion concentration was assayed by adding 10 µL of 20 µg/mL 2,3-diamino naphthalene (DAN) dissolved in 0.2N HCl to 20 µL culture supernatant, incubating at room temperature for ten minutes, and then adding 10 µL of 0.5N NaOH, and measuring the fluorescent value at 460 nm (excitation wavelength 355 nm) using an EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). The NO production inhibition rate (%) was calculated using the value without the addition of stimulating agent as control of 100 % inhibition, and the value without the addition of the compound as control of 0 % inhibition. The results thereof are shown in Table 2.

Test Example 2: Effect with respect to blood TNF-α concentration elevation by LPS stimulation
Various kinds of cytokines are produced in vivo accompanying inflammatory response and abnormal immunity or the like. Therefore, the action of test compound with respect to blood TNFα concentration rise was investigated using laboratory animals.
Female BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) were purchased, and, after preliminary rearing for about 1 week, the mice were divided into groups of four animals. The test compound was suspended in 0.5 % aqueous methyl cellulose solution and was orally administered to the test group at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Solvent was administered to control group in the same way. LPS (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to the test group and the control group one hour after the administration of the test compound or solvent, and blood was sampled one hour later. The serum was separated from the obtained blood, and the TNFα concentration in the serum was measured using an assay kit made by R&D Systems Inc. The inhibition rates of the test group with respect to the control group are shown in Table 3.

The total quantities of 1), 2) and 3) and 30g of 4) are kneaded with water, the kneaded mixture is then subjected to vacuum drying and granulation. To said granular powder is admixed 14g of 4) and 1g of 5) and the mixture subjected to tableting using a tableting machine. In this way, 1000 tablets containing 30 mg of compound of Example 1 per tablet are obtained.
