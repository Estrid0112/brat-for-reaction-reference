CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This non-provisional application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. §119(a) to Patent Application No. 10-2016-0101135, filed in the Republic of Korea on Aug. 9, 2016, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application.
BACKGROUND
(a) Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to a therapeutic agent of acute myeloid leukemia including 1,3,7-trisubstituted 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2(1H)-one derivatives, which has proliferation inhibitory activity for a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line OCI-AML3 having a NRAS mutant gene while having low inhibitory activity for a wild-type NRAS and has activity of inhibiting GCK and ACK1 protein kinases at the same time.
(b) Background Art
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a kind of blood cancer which is caused by abnormal growth or differentiation of myeloid leukocyte progenitor cells and considered the most common acute leukemia (65%) in adults. 16% or more of AML patients have a point-mutated RAS (small G protein) protein and NRAS mutations account for the majority (10% or more) of RAS kinases. For this reason, the NRAS G protein has been considered as a promising drug target for treating AML. When the RAS as a protooncogene is mutated, the RAS is continuously activated (gain-of-function) and various signaling systems of the RAS downstream are activated to accelerate the growth of cancer cells.
Over the last 40 years, RAS point mutants or key signaling molecules of the RAS downstream are proposed as targets, but due to the complexity and compensating effects of the mutated RAS signaling system, in vivo experiments and clinical trials are not extended. For example, selumetinib (AZD 6244), which inhibits MEK, a key molecule of the RAS downstream, does not have a treatment effect in all three AML patients with the NRAS mutant gene in a clinical 2 phase. In addition, as an attempt for finding targets, proteins TBK1, STK33 and GATA2 having a genetically synthetic lethal relation with KRAS mutation have been found through RNA interference (RNAi) screening. However, this attempt also did not result in clinical treatment effects. In particular, in the case of STK33, it has been proved that a therapeutic strategy using KRAS mutation and synthetic lethal principles may not be established through cell-based pharmacologic screening at a pre-clinical stage. Recently, irreversible inhibitors and allosteric inhibitors for KRAS G12C point mutations have been studied, but the studies are still in early stages. Further, recently, a compound GNF 7 that selectively inhibits a RAS mutation signaling system has been ensured and an inhibitory effect in preclinical leukemia models has been confirmed through cell-based pharmacological screening. An action mechanism of the compound GNF 7 is to inhibit two kinases GCK and ACK1 at the same time which specifically contribute to cell growth in the RAS mutation downstream. This indicates the efficacy even in an actual AML patient cell sample having the NRAS mutation.
Meanwhile, in International Patent Publication No. WO 2005-011597 (Patent Document 1), there is disclosed a compound having 3,4-dihydropyrimido [4,5-d] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one as a scaffold and it is disclosed that the compound is effective for the treatment of diseases or symptoms caused by activity of kinase such as Abl and BCR-Abl. However, in Patent Document 1, it is disclosed that the compound is useful as a therapeutic agent of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) based on BCR-Abl inhibitory activity.
The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

According to the results in Table 1 above, the compounds 1 to 7 are compounds having, mother nucleus, 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one, but there is a difference in the seventh substituent (R1) of the scaffold. That is, the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 has a remarkable difference in the proliferation inhibitory activity against the NRAS cell line depending on the substituent R1. According to the results of Table 1 above, it can be seen that when the substituent R1 is a ‘piperazinyl-substituted pyridine group’, the compound has the proliferation inhibitory activity for the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line OCI-AML3 having a NRAS mutant gene while having low inhibitory activity for wild type-NRAS (U937) and the effect thereof is remarkable.

The compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 has a remarkable difference in inhibitory activity for protein kinases GCK and ACK1 according to a substituent R1. According to the results of Table 2 above, it can be seen that when the substituent R1 is a ‘piperazinyl-substituted pyridine group’ or ‘methyl-substituted pyrazole group’, the compound has inhibitory activity for the kinases GCK and ACK1 at the same time.
