Prior arts
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) of receptor tyrosine kinase was firstly found in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The fusion protein formed by translocation of chromosome 2 and 5 contains the 3'terminal intracellular domain of ALK and the 5' terminaldomain of nuclear phosphoprotein (nucleophosmin, NPM). The ALK gene is located at chromosome 2p23 locus. Under normal circumstances the human ALK transcribes to produce mRNA with a size of 6222bp, which consisting of 29 exons and encodes a 1620 amino acid sequence of 200KDa type I transmembrane protein ALK. The protein is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and a member of the RTK insulin superfamily(Palmer R. H., et al., Biochem J., 2009, 420, 345-361.). The complete ALK has a typical three-part structure of RTK, namely extracellular domain, lipophilic transmembrane region, and cytosolictyrosine kinase. The extracellular domain contains a specific binding domain: N-terminal signal peptide, two methyl dopa, A5 protein and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase µ(MAM, meprin) domain,one low density lipoprotein A (LDLa) motif and a glycine-rich region (G-rich) near the cell membrane. MAM domain and G-rich region may be associated with the ALK activation. The first tyrosine residue, Tyr1604, of the human ALK kinase region YxxxYY motif has been shown to be associated with autologous activation of the ALK kinase region (Tartari C.J., et al., J.Bio. Chem., 2008, 283(7), 3743-3750.).
The translocation of the chromosomes results in the formation of the ALK fusion gene, which encodes a fusion protein that forms a non-ligand-dependent dimer that causes constitutive ALK activation. The activated ALK signal could cause excessive proliferation and malignant transformation of cells by activating its downstream signaling pathway of RAS-MEK-ERK, JAK-STAT3 / 5, PI3K-AKT and PLCγ.
Since ALK fusion gene has been reported for the first time in the study of anaplastie large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in 1994, ALK has been found to be able to fuse with a variety of genes, and this variety of fusion genes are closely related to the occurrence of a variety of tumors. Such as NMP-ALK fusion gene is associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma(ALCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma(DLBCL), TPM3-ALK fusion gene is associated with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), inflammatory myofibroblastoma (IMT), histiocytoma (Histioc. Tumor) and kidney cancer; and EML4-ALK fusion gene is closely related to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), kidney cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer, which become the focus of the current study (Lin E., et al., Mol.CancerRes., 2009, 7, 1466-1476.). In addition, ALK fusion gene was detected in neuroblastoma, melanoma, rhabdomyoma and esophageal squamous cell tumors (Webb TR, et al., Expert Rev.AnticancerTher., 2009, 9 (3), 331- 356.).
ALK is also associated with neurological diseases. Recent studies have shown that ALK has the function of regulating the frontal cortex and hippocampus of adult animals. ALK can be used as a new target for the treatment of mental illness, such as schizophrenia, depression and substance (heroin) addiction(Bilsland J. G., et al., Neuropsycho-pharmacology, 2008, 33, 685-700.).
Currently available ALK inhibitors are Pfizer's Crizotinib (WO2006021881, WO2007066185, WO2008053157), Novart's Ceritinib (WO2012106540) and Roche's Alectinib (WO2010143664). The development of ALK kinase inhibitor can effectively reduce the effect of mutant ALK gene on downstream signaling pathway, and thus affects the invasion and proliferation and other effects of tumor cells, and finally affects the growth of tumor cells and play an anti-tumor effect.
