FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to phenonthroline based pincer complex of formula (I) and process for preparation thereof. Particularly the present invention relates to use of phenonthroline based pincer complex of formula (I) as catalyst for the esterification of alcohols and hydrogenation of esters including lactones under mild conditions. More particularly the present invention relates to a one pot process for the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol in the presence of a pincer based catalyst and a secondary amine wherein the secondary amine is recovered and recycled.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In the state-of-the-art catalysis, design and development of new catalytic systems for selective organic transformations is of significant interest, though very challenging. Particularly, alternative ‘green’ approaches to traditionally employing stoichiometric reagents and/or harsh conditions in industrially important reactions are extremely essential with regard to both energy and environment. The direct conversion of alcohols to value-added products and hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds to the corresponding alcohols and/or amines are benchmark reactions. Alcohol esterification is one of the most important reactions in synthetic organic chemistry and has potential applications including in fragrance, polymer, and pharmaceutical industries. The reaction is typically carried-out by coupling of activated carboxylic acid derivatives with an alcohol and produce stoichiometric acid waste. An ideal and alternative approach would be catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation of alcohols with the evolution of molecular hydrogen, but homogeneous systems capable of catalyzing dehydrogenation of alcohols are relatively rare.
Catalytic hydrogenation of carboxylic acid derivatives, particularly esters with hydrogen gas, provides a promising alternative approach to conventional reduction methods. The operational simplicity, ‘green’ approach and economic viability are additional advantages and make this method much more attractive. In industry, this process is carried out under heterogeneous conditions using catalysts such as copper chromite at high pressure (200-300 atm) and temperatures (200-300° C.).

Heterogeneous catalytic systems for direct hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol require high temperature and pressure and often selectivity is the major issue. Owing to rational tuning of reactivity and selectivity of homogeneous catalysts much attention has been paid for their utility in selective hydrogenation of CO2. In recent years, pincer ligands which bind to metal centers in a tri-dentate, meridional fashion have drawn much attention and serve as excellent ligands, due to stability and variability of the generated metal-ligand framework. The donor/acceptor ability at both the central and adjacent side-arm positions of the pincer ligands can be controllable. And both the electronic and steric environment around the metal center can also be tunable.

The phenanthroline based pincer complexes of formula (I) is selected from HCl(CO)Ru(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (3), H(CO)Ru-(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (4) and H(CO)Ru(η1BH4)(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (5a).
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel phenanthroline based pincer complexes of formula (I) comprising the steps of:a) Adding solution of Lithium diisopropylamide and tBuOK in suitable solvent to a solution of 2-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline (1) in ether at temperature in the range of 0 to 5° C. followed by stirring the reaction mixture for the period ranging from 30 to 40 min at the same temperature;b) Adding a solution of di-tert-butylchlorophosphine in ether with constant stirring for further 1 to 2 hr at temperature in the range of −50 to −78° C. followed by stirring at temperature ranging from 25 to 30° C. for the period in the range of 12 to 14 hrs to obtain Phen-PNN(tBu) (2);c) Heating the reaction mixture of compound of step (b), RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 in THF at temperature in the range of 60 to 70° C. for the period ranging from 5 to 6 hr to afford HCl(CO)Ru(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (3);d) Adding Sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide to a solution of compound of step (c) in C6H6 to obtain phenanthroline based pincer complexes of formula H(CO)Ru-(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (4);e) Stirring the reaction mixture comprising compound of step (c) and NaBH4 in toluene and ethanol at temperature in the ranging from 50 to 70° C. for the period ranging from 10 to 15 min then at room temperature for the period in the range of 4 to 6 hr to afford H(CO)Ru(η1BH4)(Phen-(tBu)PNN) (5a).
The solvent in step (a) is selected from hexane heptane, tetrahydrofuran (THF) diethyl ether, toluene and etheylbenzene.
The step (c) is carried out under argon atmosphere.
The ‘N arm’ in the Milstein catalyst is hemilabile in nature and it can dissociate during the course of catalysis. Thus, under extreme conditions and by use of early transition elements (Fe, Co, Ni etc.,) metal can come out from the ligand core and generates inactive metal particles (data not available). However in the phenanthroline based system the dissociation is restricted and thus gives the unique stability to the metal centre. Py-tBuPNN ligand (liquid state) is highly moisture and air sensitive, due to this complexation has been achieved under extremely inert atmosphere (glove-box), however phenanthroline ligand (solid state) is very much stable and can handled without any special care under an ordinary atmosphere.

Example 1
Synthesis of Phen-PNN(tBu)
An oven-dried 250 mL two-necked round bottom flask equipped with an argon inlet, a stirring bar and dropping funnel is cooled under a stream of argon. The flask is then charged with 1.94 g (10.0 mmol) of 2-methyl-1,10-phenanthroline (1) in 50 mL dry ether. The solution was cooled to 0° C. and a 1.8 M solution of LDA in heptane/THF/etheylbenzene (6.2 mL, 11.0 mmol) was added via a syringe (15 min) followed by addition of tBuOK (2 mmol). The resulting brown coloured mixture was stirred for 30 min at the same temperature and a solution of di-tert-butylchlorophosphine (1.99 g, 11.0 mmol) in 10 mL dry ether was added dropwise (10 min). Continue the stirring for further 1 hr at -78° C. and the mixture was allowed slowly to warm up to 30° C. and continue the stirring for 12 hrs at the temperature. To this reaction mixture was added 20 mL of degassed water and the ether phase was separated under N2 atmosphere. The aqueous phase was extracted with ether (2×20 mL). The combined ether solutions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and the solvent was removed under vacuum to get yellowish-white solid. This was crystallized from mixture of toluene:ether (1:2) at ca. 0° C. to yield 2.27 g (67%) of 2-((di-tert-butylphosphanyl)methyl)-1,10-phenanthroline [Phen-(tBu)PNN] (2) as a white solid.

Process for the Synthesis of Methanol from Carbon Dioxide Using Ruthenium (II) Based Pincer-Type Complexes Catalyst
The process for the synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide by using single catalytic system comprising the steps of:a) mixing catalyst, secondary amine and solvent to obtain a solution;b) adding potassium tert-butoxide (if applicable) to the solution obtained in step (a) to obtain a solution;c) pressurizing the solution as obtained in step (b) with carbon dioxide at 10 atmosphere followed by H2 atmosphere in the range of 30-40 atm to obtain a solution;d) heating the solution as obtained in step (c) in the range of 110° C.-120° C. with stirring for 12-14 hrs to obtain a solution;e) removing excess gases from the solution as obtained in step (d) to obtain N-formylated product of secondary amine;f) adding catalyst and potassium tert-butoxide (if applicable)g) and pressurizing with H2 in the range of 40-45 atmosphere followed by heating the solution in the range of 110-120° C. with stirring for 18-20 hrs to obtain methanol and secondary amine.
The solvent used is tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, toluene, mesitylene, xylene etc.,
The ruthenium (II) based pincer-type complexes catalyst is selected from HCl(CO)Ru(Phen(tBu)PNN), H(CO)Ru-(Phen-(tBu)PNN), HCl(CO)Ru(BPy-tPNN), [H(CO)Ru−(BPy-tPNN)], and HCl(CO)Ru(Py-tPNN)].
The said secondary amine may be reused and is selected from:
Wherein;
X is selected from the group consisting of NH, CH2 and O
R1 and R2 are the same or different and each such substituent is independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl (linear, branched), cyclo (up to 7 membered, which may be further mono, di, tri or tetra substituted and selected from the group consisting of alkyl (linear and branced), aryl (further substituted), cycloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylheterocyclyl, alkylheteroaryl, halogen, triflurometyl, nitro, alkoxy, dialkylamino, diarylamino, and -SR), cycloalkyl, aryl (which may be further mono, di, tri or tetra substituted), heterocyclyl, heteroaryl, alkylcycloalkyl, alkylaryl, alkylheterocyclyl, and alkylheteroaryl.
The cascade hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol by a single molecular catalyst involves two steps, a) conversion of carbon dioxide to formamide, b) effective formamide hydrogenation to methanol and corresponding amine. The reaction is very selective and operates under mild conditions such as low pressure and temperature without the need of any strong acid.
According to the present invention, the schematic representation of instant process is given in scheme 1.
