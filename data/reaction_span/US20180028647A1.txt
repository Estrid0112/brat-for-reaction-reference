FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The field of the invention generally relates to compositions and methods for treating cancer, proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory diseases using compositions targeted to the disease environment, to reduce, alleviate, or prevent one or more symptoms associated with the disease.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Metabolic aberrations in the form of altered flux through key metabolic pathways are primary hallmarks of many malignant tumors. Among the many adjustments of the metabolic pathways that are found in tumor cells, a key role is played by an enhanced aerobic glycolysis followed by lactic fermentation, which is also known as the Warburg effect (Warburg, O. Science, 123:309 (1956)). Normal cells generally transform glucose into carbon dioxide and water under aerobic conditions, by means of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). On the contrary, invasive cancer cells mostly produce lactate, even in the presence of sufficient levels of oxygen, even though this glycolytic pathway turns out to be less efficient than OXPHOS in producing ATP units. This apparently counterproductive behavior of cancer cells actually constitutes a survival advantage in rapidly proliferating cells, since it makes them insensitive to transient or permanent hypoxic conditions, it contributes to the production of nucleosides and amino acids, and constitutes a very rapid way to produce energy due to the enhanced glucose uptake occurring in cancer tissues. Lactate is not just a waste product of this process. It promotes tumor invasion by favoring cell migration, angiogenesis, immune escape and radioresistance (Draoui, N, et al., Dis. Model. Mech., 4:727 (2011)). For example, rather than using lactate as a nutrient, cancer cells generally export lactate, leading to acidification of the tumor environment and a local inflammatory response that drives tumorigenesis (Doherty and Cleveland, J Clin Invest. 2013 Sep. 3; 123(9): 3685-3692). Lactate in the tumor cell microenvironment also appears to impair the adaptive immune response, disabling immune surveillance, in part by inhibiting immune cell metabolism.
Targeting this unique tumor metabolism can provide an alternative strategy to selectively destroy the tumor, leaving normal tissue unharmed (Warburg, Science 123:309-314 (1956), Zu et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 313:459-465 (2004), Samudio et al, Cancer Res. 69:2163-2166 (2009), Gatenby et al, Nat. Rev. Cancer 4:891-899 (2004), Kim et al, Cancer Res. 66:8927-8930 (2006), and Cheong et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 30:671-678 (2012)). The orphan drug dichloroacetate (DCA) is a mitochondrial kinase inhibitor that has the ability to show such characteristics. By utilizing the metabolic switch, DCA reverses the abnormal cancer cell metabolism from aerobic glycolysis to glucose oxidation by reducing the activity of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1), which negatively regulates pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) causing pyruvate to convert to acetyl-CoA promoting oxidative phosphorylation (Bonnet et al. 2007). DCA reduces the high mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) of cancer cells and increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) in malignant cells, but not in normal cells (Pathak R K et al., ACS Chem. Biol., 9:1178-1187 (2014)).
However, therapeutically prohibitive high DCA doses are needed for suppression of tumor growth due to the lack of effective mechanisms for DCA entry into tumor cells and its localization inside the target organelle, mitochondria of cells. One recent study revealed a mitochondria-targeted DCA analogue, MITO-DCA, with a much improved cellular and mitochondrial uptake (Pathak R K et al., ACS Chem. Biol., 9:1178-1187 (2014)). MITO-DCA uses a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation moiety for the targeted delivery and accumulation into the mitochondrial matrix. The study showed that MITO-DCA efficiently reduced glycolytic functions, reduced basal cellular respiration, suppressed the calculated ATP synthesis, and attenuated the spare respiratory capacity in prostate cancer cells in vitro (Pathak R K et al., ACS Chem. Biol., 9:1178-1187 (2014)).
However, targeted anti-cancer drugs such as MITO-DCA still face many challenges in accessing target sites in vivo, such as premature detachment of inhibitors from the targeting molecule, or fast elimination from the body.
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide compositions and methods that increase the stability of targeted anti-cancer agents, and minimize their premature breakdown before reaching their targeted site.
It is another object of the invention to provide compositions and methods that improve encapsulation of anti-cancer agents into drug delivery nanoparticles.
It is a further object of the invention to provide compositions and methods that increase the rate of delivery of therapeutics to disease environment in conditions such as cancer, proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory diseases, for reducing, or alleviating one or more symptoms.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Compositions including an modulator of cancer cell metabolism and, preferably, a cancer cell- or a glucose-depleted and/or lactate-rich disease environment-targeting moiety, wherein the targeting moiety is associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to the modulator, or to a nanoparticle or other delivery vehicle thereof, and methods of use for treating cancer have been developed. In some embodiments, the modulator is itself a targeting moiety, optionally associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to one or more further modulators, targeting moieties, or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the modulator reduces cancer cell glycolysis. The modulator can be, for example, a glucose transporter (GLUTs) inhibitor, a hexokinase inhibitor, a phosphofructokinase inhibitor, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor, a phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) inhibitor, an enolase (ENO) inhibitor, a pyruvate kinase (PK) activator, a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a glutaminase (GLS) inhibitor, a pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activator, a pyrvuate dehydrogenase kinase inhibitor or a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) inhibitor, an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, a glutaminase inhibitor, a glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1 (CIC) inhibitor, and a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor. In some embodiments, the modulator reduces the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in cancer cells. The modulator can also inhibit a monocarboxylate transporter (MCTs) in cancer cells. In some embodiments, the modulator is dichloracetate (DCA), dichloro acetophenone, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), oxamic acid, lonidamine (LND), metformin, geldanamycin, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), 2-Cyano-3-(1-phenyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-propenoic acid (UK5099), 4-[3-chloro-4-[[(2R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoyl]amino]phenyl]sulfonyl-N,N-dimethylbenzamide (AZD7545), teriflunomide, 2[6(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (etoximir), or ethoxyethanol.
Compositions including a modulator of cancer cell metabolism, wherein the modulator is conjugated to a hydrophobic moiety for enhanced encapsulation into a nanoparticle, and preferably a targeting moiety, wherein the targeting moiety is associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to the modulator, or to the nanoparticle and methods of use for treating cancer, are also provided. In some embodiments, the hydrophobic moiety is a substituted or unsubstituted long chain substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkylene, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl, carbocyclyl, heteroalkyl, heteroaryl, heterocyclyl, arylalkyl, or acyl, etc. In preferred embodiments, the hydrophobic moiety is a substituted or unsubstituted alkyl group such as ethyl, octyl, palmityl, or tetradecyl group.
Preferably the modulator, for example, via the targeting moiety, is preferentially delivered to cancer cells. Preferably the modulator does not target or otherwise more than minimally modulate the metabolism of non-cancer cells, particular immune cells, or does so at a reduced level compared to cancer (e.g., tumor) cells. In this way, by-products and other effects associated with aberrant metabolism in cancer cells are reduced, preferably leading directly or indirectly to cancer cell death. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is a mitochondria targeting moiety. In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is triphenylphosphonium (TPP). In some embodiments, the modulator reduces cancer cell migration, angiogenesis, immune escape and radioresistance. In preferred embodiments, the modulator induces a change in the cancer cell itself or its microenvironment that reduces suppression of, or induces activation of, an immune response against the cancer cell.
In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is a positively charged molecule at a physiological pH, preferably at the pH of the disease microenvironment. In preferred embodiments, the targeting moiety is a positively charged modulator such as metformin, imipramine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, esomeprazole, omeprazole, celecoxib, tadalafil, rosuvastatin, sitagliptin, memantine, rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate mesylate, valsartan, dexlansoprazole, olmesartan, and lisdexamfetamine.
Compositions including an active agent for treating proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory diseases, preferably, a disease environment-targeting moiety, wherein the targeting moiety is associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to the active agent, or to a nanoparticle or other delivery vehicle thereof, and methods of use for treating proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory diseases have been developed. In some embodiments, the active agent is a modulator of cellular metabolism.

The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to a subject in need thereof in an effective amount to reduce, alleviate, or prevent one or more symptoms of the cancer, proliferative disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory diseases. In some embodiments, in subjects with tumors, the pharmaceutical compositions are effective to reduce tumor burden, reduce tumor progression, or a combination thereof.
Methods for treating subjects in need thereof using the compositions are also provided. The methods typically include administering to a subject in a need thereof an effective amount of a composition including a modulator of cancer metabolism. In some embodiments, the methods include administering to the subject one or more additional active agents or procedure such as radiation or surgical removal against cancer. The additional active agent can be a chemotherapeutic agent, for example, docetaxel or anti-tumor antibody. The pharmaceutical compositions can be administered prior to or in conjunction with an additional cancer therapy and/or procedure.

I. Definitions
The term “carrier” or “excipient” refers to an organic or inorganic, natural or synthetic inactive ingredient in a formulation, with which one or more active ingredients are combined.
The terms “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” means a dosage sufficient to alleviate one or more symptoms of a disorder, disease, or condition being treated, or to otherwise provide a desired pharmacologic and/or physiologic effect. The precise dosage will vary according to a variety of factors such as subject-dependent variables (e.g., age, immune system health, etc.), the disease or disorder being treated, as well as the route of administration and the pharmacokinetics of the agent being administered.
The term “prevention” or “preventing” means to administer a composition to a subject or a system at risk for or having a predisposition for one or more symptom caused by a disease or disorder to cause cessation of a particular symptom of the disease or disorder, a reduction or prevention of one or more symptoms of the disease or disorder, a reduction in the severity of the disease or disorder, the complete ablation of the disease or disorder, stabilization or delay of the development or progression of the disease or disorder.
The term “inhibit” or other forms of the word such as “inhibiting” or “inhibition” means to reduce, diminish, minimize, hinder or restrain a particular characteristic. It is understood that this is typically in relation to some standard or expected value, in other words it is relative, but that it is not always necessary for the standard or relative value to be referred to. For example, “inhibits” an enzyme means hindering or restraining the activity of the enzyme relative to a standard or a control. “Inhibits” can also mean to hinder or restrain the synthesis or expression of the enzyme relative to a standard or control.
The terms “treatment” or “treating” means to administer a composition to a subject or a system with an undesired condition (e.g., cancer or other proliferative disorder). The condition can include a disease.
The term “parenteral administration”, means administration by any method other than through the digestive tract or non-invasive topical or regional routes. For example, parenteral administration may include administration to a patient intravenously, intradermally, intraperitoneally, intrapleurally, intratracheally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, subjunctivally, by injection, and by infusion.
The term “topical administration”, means the non-invasive administration to the skin, orifices, or mucosa. Topical administrations can be administered locally, i.e., they are capable of providing a local effect in the region of application without systemic exposure. Topical formulations can provide systemic effect via adsorption into the blood stream of the individual. Topical administration can include, but is not limited to, cutaneous and transdermal administration, buccal administration, intranasal administration, intravaginal administration, intravesical administration, ophthalmic administration, and rectal administration.
The term “enteral administration”, means administration via absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Enteral administration can include oral and sublingual administration, gastric administration, or rectal administration.
The term “pulmonary administration”, means administration into the lungs by inhalation or endotracheal administration. As used herein, the term “inhalation” refers to intake of air to the alveoli. The intake of air can occur through the mouth or nose.
The terms “bioactive agent” and “active agent”, used interchangeably, include, without limitation, physiologically or pharmacologically active substances that act locally or systemically in the body. A bioactive agent is a substance used for the treatment (e.g., therapeutic agent), prevention (e.g., prophylactic agent), diagnosis (e.g., diagnostic agent), cure or mitigation of disease or illness, a substance which affects the structure or function of the body, or pro-drugs, which become biologically active or more active after they have been placed in a predetermined physiological environment.
The terms “positively charged” refers to the overall positive charge of an active agent, a targeting moiety, or their derivatives, at a physiologically relevant pH, for example, pH of the blood is about 7.3-7.5, and pH of the slightly more acidic tumor microenvironment is about pH 6.5-6.9. The positively charged active agent remains positively charged at least prior to, during, or after administration into a subject.
The terms “sufficient” and “effective”, used interchangeably, refer to an amount (e.g. mass, volume, dosage, concentration, and/or time period) needed to achieve one or more desired result(s).
The term “biocompatible”, refers to a material that along with any metabolites or degradation products thereof that are generally non-toxic to the recipient and do not cause any significant adverse effects to the recipient. Generally speaking, biocompatible materials are materials which do not elicit a significant inflammatory or immune response when administered to a patient.
The term “biodegradable”, generally refers to a material that will degrade or erode under physiologic conditions to smaller units or chemical species that are capable of being metabolized, eliminated, or excreted by the subject. The degradation time is a function of composition and morphology. Degradation times can be from hours to weeks.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable”, refers to compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problems or complications commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, in accordance with the guidelines of agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier”, as used herein, refers to all components of a pharmaceutical formulation which facilitate the delivery of the composition in vivo. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, diluents, preservatives, binders, lubricants, disintegrators, swelling agents, fillers, stabilizers, and combinations thereof.
The term “molecular weight”, generally refers to the mass or average mass of a material. If a polymer or oligomer, the molecular weight can refer to the relative average chain length or relative chain mass of the bulk polymer. In practice, the molecular weight of polymers and oligomers can be estimated or characterized in various ways including gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or capillary viscometry. GPC molecular weights are reported as the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) as opposed to the number-average molecular weight (Mn). Capillary viscometry provides estimates of molecular weight as the inherent viscosity determined from a dilute polymer solution using a particular set of concentration, temperature, and solvent conditions.
The term “small molecule”, generally refers to an organic molecule that is less than about 2000 g/mol in molecular weight, less than about 1500 g/mol, less than about 1000 g/mol, less than about 800 g/mol, or less than about 500 g/mol. Small molecules are non-polymeric and/or non-oligomeric.
The term “dendrimer”, includes, but is not limited to, a molecular architecture with an interior core, interior layers (or “generations”) of repeating units regularly attached to this initiator core, and an exterior surface of terminal groups attached to the outermost generation. Dendrimers have regular dendrimeric or “starburst” molecular structures.
The term “copolymer”, generally refers to a single polymeric material that includes two or more different monomers. The copolymer can be of any form, such as random, block, graft, etc. The copolymers can have any end-group, including capped or acid end groups.
The term “hydrophilic”, refers to substances that have strongly polar groups that readily interact with water.
The term “hydrophobic”, refers to substances that lack an affinity for water; tending to repel and not absorb water as well as not dissolve in or mix with water.
The term “lipophilic”, refers to compounds having an affinity for lipids.
The term “amphiphilic”, refers to a molecule combining hydrophilic and lipophilic (hydrophobic) properties.
The term “mean particle size”, generally refers to the statistical mean particle size (diameter) of the particles in the composition. The diameter of an essentially spherical particle may be referred to as the physical or hydrodynamic diameter. The diameter of a non-spherical particle may refer preferentially to the hydrodynamic diameter. As used herein, the diameter of a non-spherical particle may refer to the largest linear distance between two points on the surface of the particle. Mean particle size can be measured using methods known in the art, such as dynamic light scattering. Two populations can be said to have a “substantially equivalent mean particle size” when the statistical mean particle size of the first population of nanoparticles is within 20% of the statistical mean particle size of the second population of nanoparticles; more preferably within 15%, most preferably within 10%.
The terms “monodisperse” and “homogeneous size distribution”, used interchangeably, describe a population of particles, microparticles, or nanoparticles all having the same or nearly the same size. As used herein, a monodisperse distribution refers to particle distributions in which 90% of the distribution lies within 5% of the mean particle size.
The term “targeting moiety”, refers to a moiety that binds to or localizes to a specific locale. The moiety may be, for example, a protein, nucleic acid, nucleic acid analog, carbohydrate, or small molecule. The locale may be a tissue, a particular cell type, or a subcellular compartment. The targeting moiety or a sufficient plurality of targeting moieties may be used to direct the localization of a particle or an active entity.
The term “reactive coupling group”, refers to any chemical functional group capable of reacting with a second functional group to form a covalent bond. The selection of reactive coupling groups is within the ability of the skilled artisan. Examples of reactive coupling groups can include primary amines (-NH2) and amine-reactive linking groups such as isothiocyanates, isocyanates, acyl azides, NHS esters, sulfonyl chlorides, aldehydes, glyoxals, epoxides, oxiranes, carbonates, aryl halides, imidoesters, carbodiimides, anhydrides, and fluorophenyl esters. Most of these conjugate to amines by either acylation or alkylation. Examples of reactive coupling groups can include aldehydes (-COH) and aldehyde reactive linking groups such as hydrazides, alkoxyamines, and primary amines. Examples of reactive coupling groups can include thiol groups (-SH) and sulfhydryl reactive groups such as maleimides, haloacetyls, and pyridyl disulfides. Examples of reactive coupling groups can include photoreactive coupling groups such as aryl azides or diazirines. The coupling reaction may include the use of a catalyst, heat, pH buffers, light, or a combination thereof.
The term “protective group”, refers to a functional group that can be added to and/or substituted for another desired functional group to protect the desired functional group from certain reaction conditions and selectively removed and/or replaced to deprotect or expose the desired functional group. Protective groups are known to the skilled artisan. Suitable protective groups may include those described in Greene, T. W. and Wuts, P. G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, (1991).

In contrast, a “non-tumor cell” is a normal cell (which may be quiescent or activated) that is located within a tumor microenvironment, including, but not limited to Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs), leucocytes, macrophages, and/or other cells of the immune system, and/or stromal cells, and/or fibroblasts (e.g., cancer or tumor associated fibroblasts).
II. Compositions
Direct or indirect inhibition of lactate production by cancer cells can influence the tumor microenvironment and thereby activate exhausted or dormant immune cells and/or help to influence the number of immune cells in the microenvironment. It has been established that energetics can be used to influence the microenvironment of cancers with immunological activity or inactivity.
Compositions for preferentially modulating metabolism in cancer cells are provided. The compositions generally include a cell metabolism modulator optionally in, on, or otherwise associated with a delivery vehicle such a nanoparticle, microsphere, dendrimer, antibody, or conjugate. In some embodiments, the compositions are targeted to a glucose-depleted and/or lactate-rich disease environment.
In the most preferred embodiments, the compositions lead to (a) direct or indirect inhibition of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation or any other form of metabolism that utilizes glucose or equivalents from the disease area's microenvironment or direct or indirect inhibition of the uptake of glucose or equivalents from the disease area microenvironment, and/or (b) direct or indirect inhibition of the production of lactate or equivalents, or the direct or indirect inhibition of the release of lactate or equivalents into the disease microenvironment.
Typically the composition includes a moiety or other modification that increases delivery of the modulator to the cancer cells relative to non-cancer cells, and particularly immune cells. In some embodiments, the composition include a moiety (e.g., a mitochondrial localization signal) or other characteristic (e.g., EPR, zeta potential of the delivery vehicle, etc.,), or combination thereof that enhances delivery to the mitochondria. In the most preferred embodiments, the composition is designed for delivery to (a) the tumor microenvironment generally or preferentially, and/or (b) to the cancer cells in the microenvironment.
Therapeutic targets that effect metabolism include, but are not limited to, glucose transporters (GLUT family), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) (MCT family), proteins involved in glycolysis such as hexokinase (HK family), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH family), pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyrvuate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK family), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphofructokinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), members of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle such as succinate dehydrogenase (SDH family), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH family) and members involved in oxidative phosphorylation such as Complex 1 proteins, phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM), enolase (ENO), HSP90, CPT1, glutaminase, glutamate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1 (CIC), and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.
Exemplary preferred delivery vehicles are discussed in U.S. Published Application No. 2014/0303081, which is specifically incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. In some embodiments, the delivery vehicle is a mitochondrial-targeted PLGA-PEG-TPP nanoparticle containing a metabolic modulating compound such as those disclosed herein.

In other aspects, L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 are as defined above for Formula I, with the provision that one of L1, L2, L3, L4, and L5 is not an ester. In some aspects, at least one of L1o, L2o, L3o, L4o, and L5o, is an amide linkage. In other aspects, L1o, L2o, L3o, L4o, and L5o are as defined above for Formula I, with the provision that one of L1o, L2o, L3o, L4o, and L5o is not an ester.
In some embodiments, the modulator is an anti-cancer drug. In further embodiments, the modulator is a glucose transporter (GLUTs) inhibitor, a hexokinase inhibitor, a phosphofructokinase inhibitor, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor, a phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) inhibitor, an enolase (ENO) inhibitor, a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) inhibitor, a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle inhibitor, or a monocarboxylate transporter (MCTs) inhibitor, a HSP90 inhibitor, a CPT1 inhibitor, an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, a glutaminase inhibitor, a glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1 (CIC) inhibitor, and a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor. In preferred embodiments, the modulator is dichloracetate (DCA), 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), oxamic acid, lonidamine (LND), metformin, geldanamycin, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), 2-Cyano-3-(1-phenyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-propenoic acid (UK5099), 4-[3-chloro-4-[[(2R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoyl]amino]phenyl]sulfonyl-N,N-dimethylbenzamide (AZD7545), teriflunomide, 2[6(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (etoximir), or ethoxyethanol.
In some embodiments, the modulator is a positively charged molecule at a physiological pH, such as metformin, imipramine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, esomeprazole, omeprazole, celecoxib, tadalafil, rosuvastatin, sitagliptin, memantine, rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate mesylate, valsartan, dexlansoprazole, olmesartan, and lisdexamfetamine. In some embodiments, the modulator is modified to have a positively charged molecule at a physiological pH such as addition of amine groups.
In some embodiments, the modulator is modified to have desired chemical properties for incorporation into delivery vehicles, for example, via conjugation with a hydrophobic group such as palmityl, octyl, or tetradecyl group.
In other embodiments, the targeting moiety is not directly conjugated to the modulator, but instead associated with the same nanoparticle for the targeted delivery. In further embodiments, both targeting moiety and modulator are independently modified for better encapsulation into nanoparticles so in such cases, targeting moiety and modulator are associated with each other via their interactions with the same nanoparticle.
In some embodiments, the modulators have the property of targeting to an area of interest such as a tumor site. In these cases, the modulators are by themselves targeted agents, optionally conjugated with further chemical groups for desired functionalities. These modulators can be conjugated directly, or indirectly, to one or more hydrophobic side chains for enhanced incorporation into a delivery vehicle, or to one or more additional targeting features. For example, metformin, being positive charged, is accounted for its accumulation within the matrix of energized mitochondria, without any further targeting moiety. Therefore, in a specific embodiment, the targeted agent is metformin. In yet another embodiment, the targeted agent is palmityl derivatives of metformin. In this case, TM is hydrogen in Formula I, and the long alkyl chain such as C1-C20 is linked to metformin via one or more L groups, such as L2-L3-L4-L5.
In further embodiments, modulators having the inherent property of targeting to a site of interest, are used as a targeting moiety for a second active agent. In this case, TM is
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00013.TIF </img>
For example, metformin can be conjugated directly, or indirectly to one or more active agent such as BPTES. In this case, Mo is metformin, and M is BPTES. These two modulators, or their derivatives such as palmitoylated metformin, are conugated via one or more L groups, such as L2-L3-L4-L5. Alternatively, metformin, and BPTES can be independently conjugated to separate alkyl groups, which are subsequently incorporated into the same micelle, or nanoparticle for delivery.
1. Targeting Moiety (TM)
The composition can include one or more targeting moieties associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to the modulator of cancer cell metabolism, or to a nanoparticle or other delivery vehicle thereof. The targeting elements may refer to elements that bind to or otherwise localize the nanoparticles to a specific locale. The locale may be a tissue, a particular cell type, or a subcellular compartment. In some embodiments, the composition includes a targeting moiety can, for example, target the composition to cancer cells or a tumor microenvironment, target the mitochondria, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the modulators or the nanoparticles can include targeting moieties that specifically bind to targeted molecules. A positive feedback loop is created when the nanoparticles release an inducing agent that causes a targeted cell, tissue or organ to increase the expression or bioavailability of the targeted molecules specifically recognized by the targeting moiety.
In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is pH sensitive, lactate sensitive, acid sensitive, or mitochondrial membrane potential sensitive. In some embodiments, the moiety is one that keeps the composition away from the immune cells, or healthy cells.
Representative targeting moieties include, but are not limited to, antibodies and antigen binding fragments thereof, aptamers, peptides, and small molecules. The targeting moiety can be conjugated to a hydrophobic group, e.g., a polymer that incorporates into the nanoparticle. Typically the targeting moiety is displayed on the outer shell of the nanoparticle. In some embodiments, the outer shell serves as a shield to prevent the nanoparticles from being recognized by a subject's immune system thereby increasing the half-life of the nanoparticles in the subject. In some embodiments, the nanoparticles also contain a hydrophobic core. The nanoparticles are suitable for systemic, intraperitoneal, oral, pulmonary, or topical administration. The nanoparticles also optionally include a detectable label, for example, a fluorophore or NMR contrast agent that allows visualization of nanoparticles within the diseased area.
The targeting moiety can be an antibody or antigen binding fragment thereof. The targeting moieties should have an affinity for a cell-surface receptor or cell-surface antigen on the targeted organs, tissues, cells, and/or subcellular organelles.
The targeting moiety can specifically recognize and bind to a target molecule specific for a cell type, a tissue type, or an organ. The targeted molecule can be a cell surface polypeptide, lipid, or glycolipid. The target molecule can be a receptor that is selectively expressed on a specific cell surface, a tissue or an organ. Cell specific markers can be for specific types of cells including, but not limited to stem cells, skin cells, blood cells, immune cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, cancer cells, virally infected cells, and organ specific cells. The cell markers can be specific for endothelial, ectodermal, or mesenchymal cells. Representative cell specific markers include, but are not limited to cancer specific markers.
In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is a positively charged molecule at a physiological pH, and/or at a pH of a targeted region e.g., at tumor microenvironment. In preferred embodiments, the targeting moiety is a positively charged therapeutic agent at physiological pH, and/or at pH of the target site. For example, metformin can be used as a targeting moiety to delivery itself, and/or a further active agent to a tumor site via direct, or indirect conjugation, or loading onto the same drug delivery vehicle. Some exemplary therapeutic agents that are positively charged at physiological pH are metformin, imipramine, perphenazine, trifluoperazine, esomeprazole, omeprazole, celecoxib, tadalafil, rosuvastatin, sitagliptin, memantine, rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate mesylate, valsartan, dexlansoprazole, olmesartan, and lisdexamfetamine. In some embodiments, these modulators with targeting properties are used to target a further therapeutic agent to address one or more aspects of the disease e.g., one for treating the cause of the disease, and another for alleviating one or more disease-associated symptoms. For example, an anti-cancer agent with targeting properties e.g., metformin is directly or indirectly linked to an anti-inflammatory agent.
In further embodiments, therapeutic agents are modified to have desired targeting functionalities. For example, amine groups are added to the therapeutic agents, or their derivatives to make the overall charges of the targeted agents positive.
In some embodiments, metformin and derivatives thereof are the targeting moieties for delivering one or more further modulators.
i. Mitochondria Targeting Moiety
In some embodiments, mitochondria targeting moiety is incorporated as the targeting moiety (TM) in the composition. Mitochondria targeting moiety is a moiety that targets the mitochondria by selectively delivering the compound to or accumulating the compound in the mitochondria. The mitochondrial target moiety can be any cationic molecules such as cationic ligands, cationic proteins, cationic polymers, and cationic polymer-peptide conjugates, mitochondrial localization signals, and protein transduction domains.
Exemplary mitochondria targeting moieties (TM) that can be incorporated into the compounds are delocalized lipophilic cations, which are effective at crossing the hydrophobic membranes and accumulating in the mitochondria. Triphenylphosphonium (denoted TPP or (Ph)3P+) containing compounds can accumulate greater than 10 fold within the mitochondria matrix. Any therapeutically acceptable TPP-containing compound can be used as the mitochondria targeting moiety TM in the compounds. Another delocalized lipophilic cation that can be used as TM in the compounds is dequalinium.
In other examples, the mitochondria targeting moiety can be a rhodamine cation such as Rhodamine 123. Rhodamine 6G can also be used.
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00014.TIF </img>
In further embodiments, non-cationic compounds serve to target and accumulate the compounds in the mitochondria matrix. For example, Szeto-Schiller peptides can serve as suitable mitochondria targeting moieties in the compounds to target and accumulate the inhibitor in the mitochondria matrix. Any suitable Szeto-Schiller peptide can be used in the compounds. Non limiting examples include SS-02 (H-2',6'-dimethyl-tyrosine-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2), SS-20 (H-Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2), and SS-31 (H-D-Arg-2',6'-dimethyl-tyrosine-Lys-Phe-NH2).
2. Modulators (M)
Modulator (M) is a chemical moiety that is an active agent when attached to any modification tags such as a targeting moiety, or when free (i.e., when cleaved from targeting moiety). Therefore, M is a modulator of a targeted pathway, either an agonist or an antagonist, to achieve a desired therapeutic, or prophylactic effect. In some embodiment, a modulator is capable of reducing, alleviating, or preventing one or more symptoms of a condition selected from the group consisting of cancer, autoimmune disorders, inflammatory disorders, and neurodegenerative disorders.
The increased dependence of cancer cells on the glycolytic pathway for ATP generation provides a biochemical basis for the design of therapeutic strategies to preferentially kill cancer cells.
Compositions and methods for direct or indirect pharmacological inhibition of cancer cell metabolism, including glycolysis in cancer cells, are provided. Targets of inhibitions include: (1) glycolytic enzymes directly involved in glycolysis, and glucose transporters (GLUTs), which control the availability of glucose for tumor growth; (2) enzymes involved in interconnected pathways such as pentose phosphate pathway and TCA cycle; (3) monocarboxylate transporters, which transport lactate in or from tumor cells (e.g., PPP pathway, glutamine pathway, etc.). Therefore, in some cases, the modulator is a glucose transporter (GLUTs) inhibitor, a hexokinase inhibitor, a phosphofructokinase inhibitor, a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) inhibitor, a phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM) inhibitor, an enolase (ENO) inhibitor, a lactate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) inhibitor, an inhibitor that inhibits components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, or an inhibitor that inhibits a monocarboxylate transporter (MCTs) in cancer cells, an oxidative phosphorylation inhibitor, a glutaminase inhibitor, a glutamate dehydrogenase inhibitor, a mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1 (CIC) inhibitor, and a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor.
In some embodiments, modulators are agonists that promote cellular oxidative metabolism. For example, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is believed to act in opposition to the metabolic phenotypes favored by proliferating tumor cells. Thus, in some embodiments, the modulators are AMPK agonists such as metformin, phenformin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG), salicylate, and A-769662.
In the most preferred embodiments, the modulator is a small molecule, such as those discussed in more detail below. The term “small molecule” refers to small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 daltons, preferably between 100 and 2000, more preferably between about 100 and about 1250, more preferably between about 100 and about 1000, more preferably between about 100 and about 750, more preferably between about 200 and about 500 daltons. The small molecules often include cyclical carbon or heterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or polyaromatic structures substituted with one or more functional groups.
Some exemplary modulator are dichloracetate (DCA), a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) inhibitor, 3-bromopyruvate (3BP), a hexokinase (HK) inhibitor, oxamic acid, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor, Lonidamine (LND), a HK inhibitor and MCT inhibitor. Other exemplary inhibitors include geldanamycin, a HSP90 inhibitor, ethoxyethanol, a CPT1 inhibitor, bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), a glutaminase inhibitor, 2-Cyano-3-(1-phenyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-2-propenoic acid (UK5099), a mitochondrial pyruvate transporter inhibitor, 4-[3-chloro-4-[[(2R)-3,3,3-trifluoro-2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoyl]amino]phenyl]sulfonyl-N,N-dimethylbenzamide (AZD7545), a pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 2 (PDHK2) inhibitor, teriflunomide, a dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor, and 2[6(4-chlorophenoxy)hexyl]oxirane-2-carboxylate (etoximir), a fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, 4-chloro-3-[[(3-nitrophenyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzoic acid, and benzenetricarboxylate (BTA), mitochondrial citrate transport protein (CTP) Inhibitors, and ethoxyethanol, a carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1).
In other embodiments, the modulator can be a functional nucleic acid such those discussed in more detail below. Suitable targets, and inhibitors and activators thereof, are discussed in Pelicano, et al, Oncogene (2006) 25, 4633-4646 and in more detail below.
Other exemplary modulators that can be incorporated into the compounds include mitochondrial acting anti-cancer agents. For example, the M can be a modulator of the BCL-3 protein family, such as compounds that act on BCL-XL, BCL-2, BCL-1, MCL1, or the like; compounds that affect HK, affect HK2-VDAC interaction, PDK inhibitors, affect LDH-A, affect fatty acid synthase, affect ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors, or the like; VDAC-targeting or ANT-targeting agents; ROS regulators such as SOD inhibitors, GSH inhibitors, GPX inhibitors or the like; HSP90 inhibitor or the like. Examples of specific inhibitors M that can be present in the compounds include lonidamine, dichloroacetate, alpha-tocopheryl succinate, methyl jasmonate, betulinic acid, and resveratrol, A-385358, ABT-263, ABT-737, AT-101, 2-amino-6-bromo-4-(1-cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-4H-chromene-3-carboxylate (HA 14-1), LDH-A shRNA, orlistat, SB-204990, soraphen A, 4-(N-(s-glutathionylacetate)aminophenylarsenoxide (GSAO), clodronate, PK1 1195, menadione, beta-lapachone, CD437, gamitrinibs, 8-(2-chloro-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-2-fluoro-9-(pent-4-nyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (PU24Fcl), (8-(6-bromobenzo[d][1,3,]dioxyl-5-ylthio)-9-(pent-4-nyl)-9H-purin-6-amine (PUH58), 8-(6-iodobenzo[d][1,3,]dioxyl-5-ylthio)-9-(3-isopropylamino)propyl-9H-purin-6-amine (PUH71), shepherdin, 2-methoxy estradiol, tetrathiomolybdate, buthionine sulphoximine, dimethylamino-parthenolide, parthenolide, imexons, magafodipir, menadione, motexafin gadolinium, PEITCs, elescomol (STA-4783), all trans-retinoic acid, 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid, E-3-(4'-hydroxy-3'-adamantylbiphenyl-4yl)acrylic acid, 3-bromopyruvate, butyric acid, 2-deoxyD-glucose, arsenite trioxide, betulinic acid, and the like.
In certain examples, the modulator is a Bcl-2 inhibitor, such as oblimersen sodium, AT-101, ABT-263, GX15-070, gossypol, TW-37, ApoG2, ABT 737, and obatoclax.
i. DCA & Derivatives
Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a water-soluble small molecule PDK inhibitor with excellent therapeutic abilities. One of the limitations of the molecule is its poor availability at the target site due to lack of targeting abilities. DCA encounters tremendous barriers in its navigation to enter the mitochondria. The monocarboxylate transporters which are linked to DCA cellular entry are electroneutral in most cells including tumor (Jackson et al, J. Biol. Chem. 271:861-868, 1996). Lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies are natural substrates for this transport system; hence DCA faces strong competition with these substrates for its uptake. Moreover, for mitochondrial uptake, DCA competes with pyruvate for its entry via the mitochondrial pyruvate transporter. Studies identified a new sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1) or solute carrier family-5 member-8 (SLC5A8), which is linked in the transport of acetate, propionate, butyrate, lactate, pyruvate, 3-bromopyruvate, nicotinate, and evidenced that this highly energy-coupled transporter would accept DCA as a substrate. (Coady et al, J. Physiol. 557:719-731, 2004; Miyauchi et al, J. Biol. Chem. 279: 13293-13296 (2004)). However, this transporter is expressed in normal cells, but expression is silenced in tumor cells. (Li et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:8412-8417 (2003); Babu et al, Oncogene 30:4026-4037 (2011)). Thus the lack of SLC5A8 makes tumor cells resistant to the anti-tumor activity of DCA.
Lactate is the most abundant product of highly glycolytic tumor and some of the effects of high levels of extracellular lactate include: blocking of monocyte differentiation to dendritic cells (DCs), significant inhibition of cytokine release from DCs and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, inhibition of monocyte migration, and reduction of cytotoxic T-cell function (Gottfried et al, Blood 107:2013-2021, 2006). Inhibition of glycolysis using DCA can overcome immune suppressive nature of glycolytic tumor; however, it needs very high DCA doses. Taking advantage of the fact that cancer cells frequently have more negatively charged mitochondria, a lipophilic mitochondria targeting moiety, e.g., triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation, has been used for targeted delivery of DCA, which equilibrates across the membranes in a Nernstian fashion and accumulates into the mitochondrial matrix space in inverse proportion to A i/m. (Smith et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100:5407-5412 (2003); Ross et al, Biochem. J. 411:633-645 (2008); Marrache et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109: 16288-16293 (2012); Marrache et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109: 16288-16293 (2012)).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of dichloroacetate, for example, modified with a β-alanyl group for enhanced stability of the amide linkage before further conjugation to other groups such as Tris, or one or more targeting moieties. Modifications with hydrophobic groups such as alkyl groups allow for improved encapsulation into nanoparticles. In some embodiments, these nanoparticles also encapsulate free dichloroacetate.
In some embodiments, the derivative is dichloroacetophenones.
ii. 3-bromo-2-oxopropanoate & Derivatives
3-bromopyruvate is also an inhibitor of hexokinase and has been shown to abolish ATP production and cause severe depletion of cellular ATP). 3-BP exhibits potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells with mitochondrial respiratory defects and cells in hypoxic environment (Xu R H et al., Cancer Res 65:613-621 (2005)). In addition to inhibiting HK, 3-bromopyruvate is also a potent inhibitor of glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) by reacting with the -SH nucleophile sites of these enzymes through the rapid displacement of its bromo-leaving group.
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of 3-bromopyruvate, for example, modified with a long chain alkyl group such as octyl, and tetradecyl, allowing for improved encapsulation into nanoparticles. In some embodiments, these nanoparticles also encapsulate free 3-bromopyruvate. In some embodiments, derivatization of 3-bromopyruvate involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety.
iii. Oxamate & Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are inhibitors of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Oxamate is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which is the enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate and oxidizes the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD+. Oxamate has shown to sensitize resistant cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents (Zhou M et al., Mol Cancer. 9:33 (2010)). Oxamate salt is commercially available (Sigma-Aldridge #02751).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of oxamate, for example, modified with a long chain alkyl group such as octyl. In this case, the long hydrophobic octyl group allows more efficient loading of this derivative into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, these nanoparticles also encapsulate free oxamate. In some embodiments, derivatization of oxamate involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety. In other embodiments, the targeting moiety is not directly conjugated to the modulator, but instead associated with the same nanoparticle for the targeted delivery.
iv. Metformin & Derivatives
Metformin is a clinically approved drug by the FDA to treat type II diabetes, targets the mitochondrial complex I and thereby reducing ATP synthesis. In some embodiments, the modulators are inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I.
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of metformin, for example, modified with a long chain alkyl group, for example C1-C20 alkyl groups, or substituted forms thereof. The addition of these long hydrophobic groups allows more efficient loading of this derivative into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. Alternatively, the long hydrophobic tails assemble into micelles for delivery with the active agent exposed on the outer surface of the micelles.
In some embodiments, derivatization of metformin involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety (TM). In other embodiments, derivatives of metformin and one or more targeting moieties are associated with the same nanoparticle for targeted delivery.
v. Geldanamycin & Derivatives
Geldanamycin is a benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotic that manifests anti-cancer activity through the inhibition of HSP90-chaperone function. The HSP90 molecular chaperone is expressed at high levels in a wide variety of human cancers including melanoma, leukemia, and cancers in colon, prostate, lung, and breast. In cancer cells dependent upon mutated and/or over-expressed oncogene proteins, HSP90 is thought to have a critical role in regulating the stability, folding, and activity of HSP90-associated proteins, so-called “client proteins”. These client proteins include the growth-stimulating proteins and kinases that support malignant transformation (Fukuyo Y et al., Cancer Lett. 290(1):24-35(2010)).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of geldanamycin, for example, palmityl geldanamycin. In this case, the long hydrophobic palmityl group allows more efficient loading of this derivative into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, these nanoparticles also encapsulate free geldanamycin. In some embodiments, derivatization of geldanamycin involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety (TM).
vi. Ethoxyethanol & Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are inhibitors of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1). In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives ethoxyethanol. Ethoxyethanol is an inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) that decreases beta oxidation in the mitochondria. Another example of CPT1 inhibitor is etomoxir.
vii. Lonidamine & Derivatives
Lonidamine (also known as TH-070) is a derivative of indazole-3-carboxylic acid, and has been known for a long time to inhibit aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells (Floridi et al., Cancer Res., 41(11 Pt 1):4661-6 (1981)). The proven ability of lonidamine to inhibit energy metabolism in cancer cells and to enhance the activity of other anticancer agents has led to extensive clinical trial in many cancer models.
In addition to inhibiting hexokinase, lonidamine was also shown to inhibit MCTs, which prevents lactate export from cells and causes intracellular acidification (Ben-Yoseph, O. et al., J. Neurooncol. 36, 149-157 (1998)). It was also reported that lonidamine could inhibit mitochondrial electron transport chain (Floridi, A. et al., Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 226, 73-83 (1983)). However, the mechanism underlying this inhibition is not clear.
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of lonidamine, for example, modified with a long chain alkyl group for increased hydrophobicity. In some embodiments, derivatization of lonidamine also involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety (TM).
viii. Cyanohydroxycinnamic Acid & Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are inhibitors of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT). The “classic” inhibitors of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) have been derivatives of cinnamic acid, first identified by Halestrap and co-workers for their effect on isolated mitochondrial pyruvate transport (Halestrap A P, et al., Biochem J. 1974; 138:313-316.), and by Lehninger and co-workers on intact Ehrich ascites tumor (Spencer T L, et al., Biochem J. 1976; 154:405-414.). The latter study and studies by others (Wahl M L, et al., Mol Cancer Ther. 2002; 1:617-628; Coss R A, et al., Mol Cancer Ther. 2003; 2:383-388) have indicated the cinnamic acid derivatives to be competitive inhibitors of lactate transport in tumors, with α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (ACCA), a commonly utilized off-the-shelf chemical used as a matrix during mass spectrometry, as one of the more potent inhibitors of lactate transport, with a Ki of 0.5 mM.
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of cyanohydroxycinnamic acid, for example, tetradecyl-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid. In this case, the long hydrophobic alkyl group allows more efficient loading of this derivative into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, these nanoparticles also encapsulate free cyanohydroxycinnamic acid. In some embodiments, derivatization of cyanohydroxycinnamic acid also involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety (TM).
ix. Mitochondrial Citrate Transport Protein (CTP) Inhibitor & Derivatives

The Mitochondrial Citrate Transport Protein (CTP) Inhibitor, 4-chloro-3-[[(3-nitrophenyl)amino]sulfonyl] benzoic acid, also referenced under CAS 412940-35-3, controls the biological activity of Mitochondrial Citrate Transport Protein (CTP). It is commercially available (EMD MILLIPORE #475877).

In this case, the long hydrophobic alkyl group allows more efficient loading of this derivative into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, derivatization of 4-chloro-3-[[(3-nitrophenyl)amino]sulfonyl]benzoic acid, or 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate (BTA) also involves direct conjugation of a targeting moiety (TM).
x. AZD7545 & Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are PDHK inhibitors. AZD7545 is a potent PDHK inhibitor with IC50 of 36.8 nM and 6.4 nM for PDHK1 and PDHK2, respectively. In primary rat hepatocytes, AZD7545 increases PDH activity with EC50 of 105 nM (Mayers R M, et al. Biochem Soc Trans. 31(Pt 6), 1165-1167 (2003)). AZD7545 inhibits PDHK activity by disrupting the interactions between PDHK2 and the inner lipoyl-bearing domains (L2) of the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component (E2) of PDC (Tuganova A, et al. Biochemistry. 46(29), 8592-8602 (2007)).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of AZD7545, for example, conjugated with a long chain alkyl group, and/or a targeting moiety (TM).
xi. BPTES & Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are Glutaminase GLS1 inhibitors. Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES) is a selective inhibitor of Glutaminase GLS1. Glutaminase (GLS), which converts glutamine to glutamate, plays a key role in cancer cell metabolism, growth, and proliferation (Xiang Y et al., J Clin Invest. 125(6):2293-306 (2015)).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of BPTES, for example, conjugated with a long chain alkyl group, and/or a targeting moiety (TM). Long hydrophobic alkyl group allows more efficient loading of BPTES, or its derivatives into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, this incorporation results in BPTES exposed at the surface of the nanoparticles. In other embodiments, this incorporation results in BPTES buried at, or near the core of the nanoparticles.
xii. Pemetrexed& Derivatives
In some embodiments, the modulators are inhibitors to folate metabolism and purine and pyrimidine synthesis. Pemetrexed is a novel multitargeted antifolate that inhibits > or =3 enzymes involved in folate metabolism and purine and pyrimidine synthesis. These enzymes are thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (Adjeii A A, Clin Lung Cancer. 5 Suppl 2:S51-5(2004)).
In some embodiments, the compositions are derivatives of pemetrexed, for example, conjugated with a long chain alkyl group, and/or a targeting moiety (TM). Long hydrophobic alkyl group allows more efficient loading of pemetrexed, or its derivatives into a nanoparticle for drug delivery. In some embodiments, this incorporation results in pemetrexed exposed at the surface of the nanoparticles. In other embodiments, this incorporation results in pemetrexed buried at, or near the core of the nanoparticles.
3. Linkages for Enhanced Stability
In one aspect, the compounds are engineered for stability for efficient uptake at the targeted site, for example, cancer cellul, and/or mitochondria, to induce anti-cancer activity at the target site. The compounds can also enhance the effects of anti-tumor immunity at pharmacologically relevant doses.
In some embodiments, the modulator is modified by simple chemical modifications to enhance one or more of the following properties: 1) abilities to target to specific site(s) e.g., mitochondria, 2) stability of modified analogues of the modulators i.e., to prevent premature degradation/elimination before reaching the targeted site(s), and 3) rate of encapsulation within a delivery vesicle e.g., a nanoparticle.
i. β-alanyl-DCA
The use of the comparatively stable amide linkage for DCA conjugation to alanyl allow targeting MITO-ADCA to the mitochondria whilst minimizing any premature detachment of the targeting moiety from DCA before reaching the mitochondria of cells. In some embodiments, β-alanyl-DCA is used to further conjugate to one or more targeting moieties, to long hydrophobic side chains.
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00015.TIF </img>
In some embodiments, the alanyl-modification reduces the rate of premature detachment of the targeting moiety from DCA (e.g., Mito-ADCA) before reaching the mitochondria of any target cells by 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more than 90% compared to without alanyl-modification such as in Mito-DCA.
In some embodiments, the alanyl-modification increases the rate of accumulation at the target site by 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more than 90% compared to without alanyl-modification such as in Mito-DCA.
ii. TPP-ADCA
A single ADCA conjugated to a single triphenylphosphonium moiety (TPP-ADCA) is also described, which contains one DCA per TPP molecule.
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00016.TIF </img>
iii. TPP-Tris-β-alanino-DCA (Mito-ADCA)
MITO-ADCA can be activated by the enzymes present in the mitochondria to release the active drug for its accumulation in the PDK1 binding pocket. In MITO-ADCA, the mitochondria targeting TPP cation is introduced via an amide linkage and multiple ADCA molecules were incorporated via tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris) via ester bonds.
To construct MITO-ADCA, TPP-Tris-(OH)3 is first synthesized by reacting (5-carboxypentyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide with Tris using N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), a highly specific reagent that enables the coupling of amine with carboxyl in the presence of hydroxyl groups. The hydroxyl groups from TPP-Tris-(OH)3 are coupled to Boc protected beta-alanine. Once the Boc protection groups are removed, DCA anhydride is added to produce Mito-ADCA. Coupling other inhibitors M to the TPP-Tris-(OH)3 intermediate can be accomplished in a similar manner.
MITO-ADCA contains three DCA moieties per TPP molecule, allowing the delivery of higher DCA dose using one targeting ligand. This can translate to increased therapeutic benefit. Thus, MITO-ADCA has the potential to deliver more drug dose using a single TPP targeting moiety. Similar delivery efficiency can be expected with the other inhibitors to be conjugated.

4. Linking Chemical Moiety
The compounds can contain a linking chemical moiety that serves to connect, directly or indirectly, one or more modulators to the hydrophobic portion of the compounds. The linking chemical moiety can be any organic, inorganic, or organometallic moiety which is polyvalent, so as to provide more than two points of attachment. The linking chemical moiety can be an organic molecule that contains multiple functional groups, or an organic moiety such as a substituted alkyl, unsubstituted alkyl, substituted alkylene, unsubstituted alkylene, substituted alkenyl, unsubstituted alkenyl, substituted alkynyl, unsubstituted alkynyl, substituted aryl, unsubstituted aryl, substituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted heteroaryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, substituted heterocyclyl, unsubstituted heterocyclyl, substituted arylalkyl, or unsubstituted arylalkyl.
The functional groups can be any atom or group of atoms that contains at least one atom that is neither carbon nor hydrogen, with the proviso that the groups must be capable of reacting with a nucleophile or an electrophile. Suitable functional groups include halogens (bromine, chlorine, and iodine); oxygen-containing functional groups such as a hydroxyls, epoxides, carbonyls, aldehydes, ester, carboxyls, and acid chlorides; nitrogen-containing functional groups such as amines and azides; and sulfur-containing groups such as thiols. The functional group may also be a hydrocarbon moiety which contains one or more non-aromatic pi-bonds, such as an alkyne, alkene, or diene. The linking chemical moiety can contain at least two different types of functional groups (e.g., one or more amines and one or more hydroxyls, one or more hydroxyls and one or more carboxyls, or one or more halides and one or more hydroxyls). In such cases, the different functional groups present on the linking chemical moiety can be independently addressed synthetically, permitting the covalent attachment of the rest of the compound and the one or more modulators in controlled stoichiometric ratios.
Following reaction of segments of the hydrophobic portion of the compounds and the modulator (directly or indirectly) with functional groups on the linking chemical moiety, the one or more hydrophobic portions and the one or more modulators will be covalently joined to the linking chemical moiety via bonds. The identity of these bonds will be determined by the identity of the functional group on the linking chemical moiety, the reactive loci of the hydrophobic portion or the rest of the compound and that of the functional group that attaches the modulator (directly or indirectly) to the linking chemical moiety. Examples of suitable bonds that connect the portions of the compound to the linking chemical moiety include -C(O)NH-, -C(O)NR'-, -NR'C(O)-, -C(O)O-, -OC(O)-, -C(O)OCH2-, -SO2NR'-, -CH2R'-, -O-, -NR'H-, -NR'-, -OCONH-, -NHCOO-, -OCONR'-, -NRCOO-, -NHCONH-, -NR'CONH-, -NHCONR'-, -NR'CONR'-, -CHOH-, -CROH-, unsubstituted alkyl (such as unsubstituted C1-C12 alkyl), substituted alkyl (such as substituted C1-C12 alkyl), wherein R' is hydrogen, halogen (F, Cl, Br, I), hydroxyl, unsubstituted alkyl (such as unsubstituted C1-C12 alkyl), substituted alkyl (such as substituted C1-C12 alkyl), substituted alkylene (such as substituted C1-C12 alkylene), unsubstituted alkylene (such as unsubstituted C1-C12 alkylene), an aryl group, or a heterocyclic group. Exemplary linking chemical moieties include the following organic compounds:

5. Modifications for Enhanced Encapsulation into Nanoparticles
In one aspect, the chemical linkages and/or modifications to the TM, and/or M are engineered for enhanced rate of encapsulation into delivery vehicles such as nanoparticles.
Generally, the enhanced rate of encapsulation of M and/or TM into nanoparticles is not limited by a particular mode of incorporation. For example, M and/or TM can be either exposed at the surface of the nanoparticles, buried at/near the core of the nanoparticles, or combinations thereof. The enhanced rate of encapsulation can also be achieved through increased non-covalent association with the nanoparticles, such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals' forces, electrostatic interactions etc.
In some embodiments, two or more modulators independently conjugated to substituted/unsubstituted alkyl group(s), are subsequently joined together via one or more hydrophobic moieties. In such case, Formula I applies, where TM is
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00026.TIF </img>
For example, IMo is metformin, and M is DCA. These two modulators, or their derivatives such as palmitoylated metformin, are conugated via one or more L groups, such as L2-L3-L4-L5, and a W group. Any one or more of the L2-L3-L4-L5, and W can be hydrophobic groups. Without being limited to a certain theory, such molecular arrangement helps to enhance their incorporation into micelles, or nanoparticles such that the hydrophilic modulators e.g., metformin, and DCA, are located at, or close to the surface of the micelles, the alkyl groups, and the one more or hydrophobic moieties are at, or near the core of the micelles. Generally, this molecular design for enhanced incorporation into nanoparticles applies to any hydrophilic modulators, hydrophilic targeting moieties, or combinations thereof.
In some embodiments, two or more modulators independently conjugated to substituted/unsubstituted alkyl group(s), are subsequently joined together via one or more hydrophilic moieties. In such case, Formula I applies, where TM is
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00027.TIF </img>
For example, IMo is BPTES, and M is pemetrexed. These two modulators, or their derivatives such as palmitoylated BPTES, are conugated via one or more L groups, such as L2-L3-L4-L5, and W. Any one or more of the L2-L3-L4-L5, and W are hydrophilic groups. Without being limited to a certain theory, such molecular arrangement helps to enhance their incorporation into micelles, or nanoparticles such that the hydrophilic moieties e.g., a phosphodiester linkage, are located at the surface of the micelles, the alkyl groups, and modulators e.g., BPTES, and pemetrexed, are at, or near the core of the micelles. Generally, this molecular design for enhanced incorporation into nanoparticles applies to any hydrophobic modulators, hydrophobic targeting moieties, or combinations thereof. In some further embodiments, these encapsulated, conjugated modulators are incorporated into the same micelle as those surface-exposed, conjugated modulators for desired targeting properties, and/or drug efficacy.
In some embodiments, the IM, IMo, TM is a positively, or negatively charged molecule to be incorporated into a delivery vehicle. In some embodiments, the IM, IMo, or TM is a hydrophobic, or hydrophilic molecule. In some embodiments, the M or TM is a positively charged molecule, either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, at a physiological pH; and IMo conjugated directly, or indirectly to the M is either positively, or negatively charged, either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, or combinations thereof.
In some embodiments, the increase in the length of alkyl chain increases the hydrophobicity of the composition, and enhances the rate of encapsulation into nanoparticles. For example, the increase in hydrophobicity increases the rate of encapsulation into the nanoparticle by 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or more than 90% compared to those without such modifications.

B. Additional Moieties
The modulator itself, or nanoparticles or another vehicle carrying the modulator can be associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to one or more additional moieties. The moiety can be a further targeting moiety, a detectable label, or a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent. For example, a polymer conjugate can be a PLGA-PEG-phosphonate.
C. Imaging Agents
The compositions can be incorporated into nanoparticles along with a detectable label, such as a radioisotope, a fluorophore (e.g., fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin (PE)), an enzyme (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, horseradish peroxidase), element particles (e.g., gold particles) or a contrast agent. These may be encapsulated within, the nanoparticles carrying the modulators and/or targeting moieties.
For example, a fluorescent label can be chemically conjugated to a polymer of the nanoparticle to yield a fluorescently labeled polymer. In other embodiments the label is a contrast agent. A contrast agent refers to a substance used to enhance the contrast of structures or fluids within the body in medical imaging. Contrast agents are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, agents that work based on X-ray attenuation and magnetic resonance signal enhancement. Suitable contrast agents include iodine and barium.
In some embodiments, the targeting moiety is the imaging agent, for example Rhodamine 123.
D. Dendrimeric Compounds
Dendrimers offer precise architecture, high loading capacity, tunable solubility, and bioconjugation capability. The compounds disclosed herein can comprise dendrimers or hyperbranched polymers with multiple targeting moieties and modulators. The combination of the unique properties of dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers with the targeting moieties and modulators can lead to a more efficient-synthesis of compounds possessing high efficiency, for example, for bulk production.
Suitable dendrimers scaffolds that can be used herein include poly(amidoamine), also known as PAMAM, or STARBURST™ dendrimers; polypropylamine (POPAM), polyethylenimine, polylysine, polyester, iptycene, aliphatic poly(ether), and/or aromatic polyether dendrimers. Each dendrimer of the dendrimer complex may be same or of similar or different chemical nature than the other dendrimers (e.g., the first dendrimer may include a PAMAM dendrimer, while the second dendrimer may be a POPAM dendrimer). In some embodiments, the first or second dendrimer may further include an additional agent such as a multiarm PEG polymer including a polyethylene glycol having at least two branches bearing sulfhydryl or thiopyridine terminal groups. Other PEG polymers bearing other terminal groups such as succinimidyl or maleimide terminations can be used. The PEG polymers in the molecular weight 10 kDa to 80 kDa can be used. Complexes can be formed of one or more dendrimers.
The manufacturing process for these dendrimers is a series of repetitive steps starting with a central initiator core (e.g., ethylenediamine-cores). Each subsequent growth step represents a new “generation” of polymer with a larger molecular diameter, twice the number of reactive surface sites, and approximately double the molecular weight of the preceding generation. Dendrimeric scaffolds suitable for use herein are commercially available in a variety of generations. Preferable, the disclosed dendrimeric compounds herein are based generation 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 dendrimeric scaffolds. Such scaffolds have, respectively, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, and 4096 reactive sites. Thus, the disclosed dendrimeric compounds based on these scaffolds have the corresponding number of combined targeting moieties and modulators.
Polyether amines are also suitable and contain primary amino groups attached to the terminus of a polyether backbone. The polyether backbone is typically based either on propylene oxide (PO), ethylene oxide (EO), or mixed EO/PO/BO. In one aspect, the polyether amine can be a polyoxyalkyleneamines. Such polyether amines can be obtained commercially from Huntsman Performance Products (Salt Lake City, Utah) under the name JEFF AMINE™ (e.g, JEFFAMINE D230). JEFF AMINES can have monoamines, diamines, and triamines, and are available in a variety of molecular weights, ranging up to 5,000. Further examples of suitable dendrimers are based on 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (MPA). These hyperbranched polymers are commercially available in 2, 3, or 4, generations, which respectively have 16, 32, and 64 reactive sites for linking the disclosed TM and M moieties.
Still further, suitable dendrimers can be prepared by combining two or more dendrons. Dendrons are wedge-shaped sections of dendrimers with reactive focal point functional groups. Many dendron scaffolds are commercially available. They come in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6th generations with, respectively, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 reactive groups. In certain examples, TM moieties are linked to one type of dendron and the inhibitor moieties are linked to another type of dendron. The two dendrons are then connected to form a dendrimer. A specific example of these compounds is shown below where a 2nd generation MPA dendron with 4 reactive sites was coupled to triphenylphosphinyl containing TM moieties. A separate 5th generation MPA dendron, with 32 reactive sites, was coupled to DCA. The two dendrons were then linked via click chemistry (i.e., a 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction between an azide moiety on one dendron and alkyne moiety on another to form a triazole linker.
Exemplary preferred dendrimers are discussed in Published Application No. PCT/US2014/045131, which is specifically incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
E. Nanoparticles
Generally, nanoparticles can be used to deliver the compounds to any targeted site, e.g. specific cell types, specific organelles. Mitochondria targeted polymeric nanoparticles are being used for delivery of the compounds to mitochondria and different parts within mitochondria. Exemplary preferred embodiments include, but are not limited to, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing dichloroacetate, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing lonidamine, mitochondrial targeting nanoparticle containing 3-bromopyruvate, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing galloflavin or oxalate, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing metformin, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing geldanamycin, mitochondrial-targeting nanoparticle containing cyanohydroxycinnamic acid.
Appropriate delivery vehicles for the compounds are known in the art and can be selected to suit the particular active agent. For example, in some embodiments, the composition is incorporated into or encapsulated by, or bound to, a nanoparticle, microparticle, microsphere, micelle, synthetic lipoprotein particle, or carbon nanotube. For example, the compositions can be incorporated into a vehicle such as polymeric microparticles or polymer nanoparticles which provide controlled release of the active agent(s). In some embodiments, release of the drug(s) is controlled by diffusion of the active agent(s) out of the microparticles and/or degradation of the polymeric particles by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation.
In some embodiments, two modulators, with or without targeting moieties, are incorporated into the same particles and are formulated for release at different times and/or over different time periods. For example, in some embodiments, one of the agents is released entirely from the particles before release of the second agent begins. In other embodiments, release of the first agent begins followed by release of the second agent before the all of the first agent is released. In still other embodiments, both agents are released at the same time over the same period of time or over different periods of time.
1. Particle Core
The particle core can be a polymeric particle, a lipid particle, a solid lipid particle, an inorganic particle, or combinations thereof.

Non-biodegradable polymers can include ethylene vinyl acetate, poly(meth) acrylic acid, polyamides, copolymers and mixtures thereof.
Excipients may also be added to the core polymer to alter its porosity, permeability, and or degradation profile.
The polymeric core can contain one or more hydrophilic polymers. Hydrophilic polymers include cellulosic polymers such as starch and polysaccharides; hydrophilic polypeptides; poly(amino acids) such as poly-L-glutamic acid (PGS), gamma-polyglutamic acid, poly-L-aspartic acid, poly-L-serine, or poly-L-lysine; polyalkylene glycols and polyalkylene oxides such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO); poly(oxyethylated polyol); poly(olefinic alcohol); polyvinylpyrrolidone); poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide); poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate); poly(saccharides); poly(hydroxy acids); poly(vinyl alcohol), and copolymers thereof.
Examples of suitable hydrophobic polymers include polyhydroxyacids such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), and poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acids); polyhydroxyalkanoates such as poly3-hydroxybutyrate or poly4-hydroxybutyrate; polycaprolactones; poly(orthoesters); polyanhydrides; poly(phosphazenes); poly(lactide-co-caprolactones); polycarbonates such as tyrosine polycarbonates; polyamides (including synthetic and natural polyamides), polypeptides, and poly(amino acids); polyesteramides; polyesters; poly(dioxanones); poly(alkylene alkylates); hydrophobic polyethers; polyurethanes; polyetheresters; polyacetals; polycyanoacrylates; polyacrylates; polymethylmethacrylates; polysiloxanes; poly(oxyethylene)/poly(oxypropylene) copolymers; polyketals; polyphosphates; polyhydroxyvalerates; polyalkylene oxalates; polyalkylene succinates; poly(maleic acids), as well as copolymers thereof.

The molecular weight of the hydrophobic polymer can be varied to tailor the properties of polymeric particle core. For example, the molecular weight of the hydrophobic polymer segment can be varied to engineer nanoparticles possessing the required average particle size and degradation profile. The hydrophobic polymer segment has a molecular weight of between about 150 Da and about 100 kDa, more preferably between about 1 kDa and about 75 kDa, most preferably between about 5 kDa and about 50 kDa.
The polymeric particle core can contain an amphiphilic polymer. Amphiphilic polymers can include block copolymers of any of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic polymers described above. In some embodiments the amphiphilic polymer is a copolymer containing a hydrophobic polyhydroxyacid block and a hydrophilic polyalkylene glycol block. The amphiphilic polymer can be a PLGA-PEG block copolymer, and PGA-PEG block copolymer, or a PLGA-PEG block copolymer.
PEGylation may also be used, in some cases, to decrease charge interaction between a polymer and a biological moiety, e.g., by creating a hydrophilic layer on the surface of the polymer, which may shield the polymer from interacting with the biological moiety. In some cases, the addition of poly(ethylene glycol) repeat units may increase plasma half-life of the polymer (e.g., copolymer, e.g., block copolymer), for instance, by decreasing the uptake of the polymer by the phagocytic system while decreasing transfection/uptake efficiency by cells. Those of ordinary skill in the art will know of methods and techniques for PEGylating a polymer, for example, by using EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride) and NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) to react a polymer to a PEG group terminating in an amine, or by ring opening polymerization techniques (ROMP).
Copolymers containing poly(ester-ether)s, e.g., polymers having repeat units joined by ester bonds (e.g., R-C(O)-O-R' bonds) and ether bonds (e.g., R-O-R' bonds) may be formed as a hydrolyzable polymer, containing carboxylic acid groups, conjugated with poly(ethylene glycol) repeat units to form a poly(ester-ether).
The polymeric particle core can contain any of the above polymers or blends or copolymers thereof. The polymeric particle core can contain one, two, three, or more different polymers.
Amphiphilic compounds include, but are not limited to, phospholipids, such as 1,2 distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine (DAPC), dibehenoylphosphatidylcholine (DBPC), ditricosanoylphosphatidylcholine (DTPC), and dilignoceroylphatidylcholine (DLPC), incorporated at a ratio of between 0.01-60 (weight lipid/w polymer), most preferably between 0.1-30 (weight lipid/w polymer). Phospholipids which may be used include, but are not limited to, phosphatidic acids, phosphatidyl cholines with both saturated and unsaturated lipids, phosphatidyl ethanolamines, phosphatidylglycerols, phosphatidylserines, phosphatidylinositols, lysophosphatidyl derivatives, cardiolipin, and β-acyl-γ-alkyl phospholipids. Examples of phospholipids include, but are not limited to, phosphatidylcholines such as dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, dipentadecanoylphosphatidylcholine dilauroylphosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC), diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine (DAPC), dibehenoylphosphatidylcholine (DBPC), ditricosanoylphosphatidylcholine (DTPC), dilignoceroylphatidylcholine (DLPC); and phosphatidylethanolamines such as dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine or 1-hexadecyl-2-palmitoylglycerophosphoethanolamine. Synthetic phospholipids with asymmetric acyl chains (e.g., with one acyl chain of 6 carbons and another acyl chain of 12 carbons) may also be used.
The amphiphilic lipid can have a molecular weight of 200 to 1000, e.g., 700-900. By containing a relatively small amount of lipid, the nanoparticles avoid the negative impact that a tri, tetra or higher layer of lipid could have on a nanoparticle, such as an adverse effect on drug release. Thus, in one embodiment, the nanoparticles comprise approximately 10% to 40% lipid (by weight), and will have a size of about 90 nm to about 40 nm in diameter.
In a particular embodiment, an amphiphilic component that can be used to form an amphiphilic layer is lecithin, and, in particular, phosphatidylcholine. Lecithin forms a phospholipid bilayer having the hydrophilic (polar) heads facing aqueous solutions, and the hydrophobic tails facing each other. Lecithin has an advantage of being a natural lipid that is available from, e.g., soybean, and already has FDA approval for use in other delivery devices.
The particle core can be a lipid particle core. In some embodiments the particle core is a lipid nanoparticle. Lipid particles and lipid nanoparticles are known in the art. The lipid particles and lipid nanoparticles can be lipid micelles, liposomes, or solid lipid particles. The lipid particle can be made from one or a mixture of different lipids. Lipid particles are formed from one or more lipids, which can be neutral, anionic, or cationic at physiologic pH. The lipid particle is preferably made from one or more biocompatible lipids. The lipid particles may be formed from a combination of more than one lipid, for example, a charged lipid may be combined with a lipid that is non-ionic or uncharged at physiological pH.
The particle core can be a lipid micelle. Lipid micelles for drug delivery are known in the art. Lipid micelles can be formed, for instance, as a water-in-oil emulsion with a lipid surfactant. An emulsion is a blend of two immiscible phases wherein a surfactant is added to stabilize the dispersed droplets. In some embodiments the lipid micelle is a microemulsion. A microemulsion is a thermodynamically stable system composed of at least water, oil and a lipid surfactant producing a transparent and thermodynamically stable system whose droplet size is less than 1 micron, from about 10 nm to about 500 nm, or from about 10 nm to about 250 nm. Lipid micelles are generally useful for encapsulating hydrophobic active agents, including hydrophobic therapeutic agents, hydrophobic prophylactic agents, or hydrophobic diagnostic agents.
The particle core can be a liposome. Liposomes are small vesicles composed of an aqueous medium surrounded by lipids arranged in spherical bilayers. Liposomes can be classified as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, or multi-lamellar vesicles. Multi-lamellar liposomes contain multiple concentric lipid bilayers. Liposomes can be used to encapsulate targeted agents, by trapping hydrophilic agents in the aqueous interior or between bilayers, or by trapping hydrophobic agents within the bilayer.
The lipid micelles and liposomes typically have an aqueous center. The aqueous center can contain water or a mixture of water and alcohol. Suitable alcohols include, but are not limited to, methanol, ethanol, propanol, (such as isopropanol), butanol (such as n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, tert-butanol, pentanol (such as amyl alcohol, isobutyl carbinol), hexanol (such as 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol), heptanol (such as 1-heptanol, 2-heptanol, 3-heptanol and 4-heptanol) or octanol (such as 1-octanol) or a combination thereof.

Solid lipid particles are typically submicron in size, i.e. from about 10 nm to about 1 micron, from 10 nm to about 500 nm, or from 10 nm to about 250 nm. Solid lipid particles are formed of lipids that are solids at room temperature. They are derived from oil-in-water emulsions, by replacing the liquid oil by a solid lipid.

The lipids can also include various natural (e.g., tissue derived L-α-phosphatidyl: egg yolk, heart, brain, liver, soybean) and/or synthetic (e.g., saturated and unsaturated 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines, 1-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines, 1,2-diheptanoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine) derivatives of the lipids.

III. Methods of Making Particles
Methods for making the anti-cancer compositions for enhanced delivery to target sites are provided. The methods generally include polymer synthesis, nanoparticle preparation including encapsulation of the compositions.
In some embodiments, the compositions self assemble first due their hydrophobic groups, prior to their mixing with polymers in preparing for inhibitor-loaded nanoparticles.
A. Polymer Conjugates Methods of polymer synthesis are described, for instance, in Braun et al. (2005) Polymer Synthesis: Theory and Practice. New York, N.Y.: Springer. The polymers may be synthesized via step-growth polymerization, chain-growth polymerization, or plasma polymerization. In most case they can be purchased from commercial sources.
In some embodiments an amphiphilic polymer is synthesized starting from a hydrophobic polymer terminated with a first reactive coupling group and a hydrophilic polymer terminated with a second reactive coupling group capable of reacting with the first reactive coupling group to form a covalent bond. One of either the first reactive coupling group or the second reactive coupling group can be a primary amine, where the other reactive coupling group can be an amine-reactive linking group such as isothiocyanates, isocyanates, acyl azides, NHS esters, sulfonyl chlorides, aldehydes, glyoxals, epoxides, oxiranes, carbonates, aryl halides, imidoesters, carbodiimides, anhydrides, and fluorophenyl esters. One of either the first reactive coupling group or the second reactive coupling group can be an aldehyde, where the other reactive coupling group can be an aldehyde reactive linking group such as hydrazides, alkoxyamines, and primary amines. One of either the first reactive coupling group or the second reactive coupling group can be a thiol, where the other reactive coupling group can be a sulfhydryl reactive group such as maleimides, haloacetyls, and pyridyl disulfides.
In preferred embodiments a hydrophobic polymer terminated with an amine or an amine-reactive linking group is coupled to a hydrophilic polymer terminated with complimentary reactive linking group. For example, an NHS ester activated PLGA can be formed by reacting PLGA-CO(OH) with NHS and a coupling reagent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or ethyl(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). The NHS ester activated PLGA can be reacted with a hydrophilic polymer terminated with a primary amine, such as a PEG-NH2 to form an amphiphilic PLGA-b-PEG block copolymer.
In some embodiments, a conjugate of an amphiphilic polymer with a targeting moiety is formed using the same or similar coupling reactions. In some embodiments the conjugate is made starting from a hydrophilic polymer terminated on one end with a first reactive coupling group and terminated on a second end with a protective group. The hydrophilic polymer is reacted with a targeting moiety having a reactive group that is complimentary to the first reactive group to form a covalent bond between the hydrophilic polymer and the targeting moiety. The protective group can then be removed to provide a second reactive coupling group, for example to allow coupling of a hydrophobic polymer block to the conjugate of the hydrophilic polymer with the targeting moiety. A hydrophobic polymer terminated with a reactive coupling group complimentary to the second reactive coupling group can then be covalently coupled to form the conjugate. Of course, the steps could also be performed in reverse order, i.e. a conjugate of a hydrophobic polymer and a hydrophilic polymer could be formed first followed by deprotection and coupling of the targeting moiety to the hydrophilic polymer block.
In some embodiments, a conjugate is formed having a moiety conjugated to both ends of the amphiphilic polymer. For example, an amphiphilic polymer having a hydrophobic polymer block and a hydrophilic polymer block may have targeting moiety conjugated to the hydrophilic polymer block and an additional moiety conjugated to the hydrophobic polymer block. In some embodiments the additional moiety can be a detectable label. In some embodiments the additional moiety is a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent. For example, the additional moiety could be a moiety used for radiotherapy. The conjugate can be prepared starting from a hydrophobic polymer having on one end a first reactive coupling group and a another end first protective group and a hydrophilic polymer having on one end a second reactive coupling group and on another end a second protective group. The hydrophobic polymer can be reacted with the additional moiety having a reactive coupling group complimentary to the first reactive coupling group, thereby forming a conjugate of the hydrophobic polymer to the additional moiety. The hydrophilic polymer can be reacted with a targeting moiety having a reactive coupling group complimentary to the second reactive coupling group, thereby forming a conjugate of the hydrophilic polymer to the targeting moiety. The first protective group and the second protective group can be removed to yield a pair of complimentary reactive coupling groups that can be reacted to covalently link the hydrophobic polymer block to the hydrophilic polymer block.
B. Emulsion Methods
In some embodiments, a nanoparticle is prepared using an emulsion solvent evaporation method. For example, a polymeric material is dissolved in a water immiscible organic solvent and mixed with a drug solution or a combination of drug solutions. In some embodiments a solution of a therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic agent to be encapsulated is mixed with the polymer solution. The polymer can be, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: PLA, PGA, PCL, their copolymers, polyacrylates, the aforementioned PEGylated polymers, the aforementioned Polymer-drug conjugates, the aforementioned polymer-peptide conjugates, or the aforementioned fluorescently labeled polymers, or various forms of their combinations. The drug molecules can be, but are not limited to, one or a more of the following: PPARgamma activators (e.g. Rosiglitazone, (RS)-5-[4-(2-[methyl(pyridin-2-yl)amino]ethoxy)benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione, Pioglitazone, (RS)-5-(4-[2-(5-ethylpyridin-2-yl)ethoxy]benzyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione, Troglitazone, (RS)-5-(4-[(6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-yl)methoxy]benzyl)thiazolidine-2,4-dione etc.), prostagladin E2 analog (PGE2, (5Z,11α,13E,15S)-7-[3-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyoct-1-enyl)-5-oxo-cyclopentyl] hept-5-enoic acid etc.), beta3 adrenoceptor agonist (CL 316243, Disodium 5-[(2R)-2-[[(2R)-2-(3-Chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate hydrate, etc.), Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF-21), Irisin, RNA, DNA, chemotherapeutic compounds, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) contrast agents, or combinations thereof. The water immiscible organic solvent, can be, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: chloroform, dichloromethane, and acyl acetate. The drug can be dissolved in, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: acetone, ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
In some embodiments the polymer solution contains one or more polymer conjugates as described above. The polymer solution can contain a first amphiphilic polymer conjugate having a hydrophobic polymer block, a hydrophilic polymer block, and a targeting moiety conjugated to the hydrophilic end. In preferred embodiments the polymer solution contains one or more additional polymers or amphiphilic polymer conjugates. For example the polymer solution may contain, in addition to the first amphiphilic polymer conjugate, one or more hydrophobic polymers, hydrophilic polymers, lipids, amphiphilic polymers, polymer-drug conjugates, or conjugates containing other targeting moieties. By controlling the ratio of the first amphiphilic polymer to the additional polymers or amphiphilic polymer conjugates, the density of the targeting moieties can be controlled. The first amphiphilic polymer may be present from 1% to 100% by weight of the polymers in the polymer solution. For example, the first amphiphilic polymer can be present at 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, or 60% by weight of the polymers in the polymer solution.
An aqueous solution is then added into the resulting mixture solution to yield emulsion solution by emulsification. The emulsification technique can be, but not limited to, probe sonication or homogenization through a homogenizer. The plaque-targeted peptides or fluorophores or drugs may be associated with the surface of, encapsulated within, surrounded by, and/or distributed throughout the polymeric matrix of this inventive particle.
C. Nanoprecipitation Method
In another embodiment, a nanoparticle is prepared using nanoprecipitation methods or microfluidic devices. A polymeric material is mixed with a drug or drug combinations in a water miscible organic solvent. The polymer can be, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: PLA, PGA, PCL, their copolymers, polyacrylates, the aforementioned PEGylated polymers, the aforementioned Polymer-drug conjugates, the aforementioned polymer-peptide conjugates, or the aforementioned fluorescently labeled polymers, or various forms of their combinations.

The water miscible organic solvent, can be, but is not limited to, one or more of the following: acetone, ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile and Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The resulting mixture solution is then added to a polymer non-solvent, such as an aqueous solution, to yield nanoparticle solution. The plaque-targeted peptides or fluorophores or drugs may be associated with the surface of, encapsulated within, surrounded by, and/or distributed throughout the polymeric matrix of this inventive particle.
D. Microfluidics
Methods of making nanoparticles using microfluidics are known in the art. Suitable methods include those described in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2010/0022680 A1 by Karnik et al. In general, the microfluidic device comprises at least two channels that converge into a mixing apparatus. The channels are typically formed by lithography, etching, embossing, or molding of a polymeric surface. A source of fluid is attached to each channel, and the application of pressure to the source causes the flow of the fluid in the channel. The pressure may be applied by a syringe, a pump, and/or gravity. The inlet streams of solutions with polymer, targeting moieties, lipids, drug, payload, etc. converge and mix, and the resulting mixture is combined with a polymer non-solvent solution to form the nanoparticles having the desired size and density of moieties on the surface. By varying the pressure and flow rate in the inlet channels and the nature and composition of the fluid sources nanoparticles can be produced having reproducible size and structure.
E. Other Methodologies
1. Solvent Evaporation
In this method the polymer is dissolved in a volatile organic solvent, such as methylene chloride. The drug (either soluble or dispersed as fine particles) is added to the solution, and the mixture is suspended in an aqueous solution that contains a surface active agent such as poly(vinyl alcohol). The resulting emulsion is stirred until most of the organic solvent evaporated, leaving solid microparticles. The resulting microparticles are washed with water and dried overnight in a lyophilizer. Microparticles with different sizes (0.5-1000 microns) and morphologies can be obtained by this method. This method is useful for relatively stable polymers like polyesters and polystyrene.
However, labile polymers, such as polyanhydrides, may degrade during the fabrication process due to the presence of water. For these polymers, the following two methods, which are performed in completely anhydrous organic solvents, are more useful.
2. Hot Melt Microencapsulation
In this method, the polymer is first melted and then mixed with the solid particles. The mixture is suspended in a non-miscible solvent (like silicon oil), and, with continuous stirring, heated to 5 □C above the melting point of the polymer. Once the emulsion is stabilized, it is cooled until the polymer particles solidify. The resulting microparticles are washed by decantation with petroleum ether to give a free-flowing powder. Microparticles with sizes between 0.5 to 1000 microns are obtained with this method. The external surfaces of spheres prepared with this technique are usually smooth and dense. This procedure is used to prepare microparticles made of polyesters and polyanhydrides. However, this method is limited to polymers with molecular weights between 1,000-50,000.
3. Solvent Removal
This technique is primarily designed for polyanhydrides. In this method, the drug is dispersed or dissolved in a solution of the selected polymer in a volatile organic solvent like methylene chloride. This mixture is suspended by stirring in an organic oil (such as silicon oil) to form an emulsion. Unlike solvent evaporation, this method can be used to make microparticles from polymers with high melting points and different molecular weights. Microparticles that range between 1-300 microns can be obtained by this procedure. The external morphology of spheres produced with this technique is highly dependent on the type of polymer used.
4. Spray-Drying
In this method, the polymer is dissolved in organic solvent. A known amount of the active drug is suspended (insoluble drugs) or co-dissolved (soluble drugs) in the polymer solution. The solution or the dispersion is then spray-dried. Typical process parameters for a mini-spray drier (Buchi) are as follows: polymer concentration=0.04 g/mL, inlet temperature=−24° C., outlet temperature=13-15° C., aspirator setting=15, pump setting=10 mL/minute, spray flow=600 Nl/hr, and nozzle diameter=0.5 mm. Microparticles ranging between 1-10 microns are obtained with a morphology which depends on the type of polymer used.
5. Hydrogel Microparticles
Microparticles made of gel-type polymers, such as alginate, are produced through traditional ionic gelation techniques. The polymers are first dissolved in an aqueous solution, mixed with barium sulfate or some bioactive agent, and then extruded through a microdroplet forming device, which in some instances employs a flow of nitrogen gas to break off the droplet. A slowly stirred (approximately 100-170 RPM) ionic hardening bath is positioned below the extruding device to catch the forming microdroplets. The microparticles are left to incubate in the bath for twenty to thirty minutes in order to allow sufficient time for gelation to occur. Microparticle particle size is controlled by using various size extruders or varying either the nitrogen gas or polymer solution flow rates. Chitosan microparticles can be prepared by dissolving the polymer in acidic solution and crosslinking it with tripolyphosphate. Carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) microparticles can be prepared by dissolving the polymer in acid solution and precipitating the microparticle with lead ions. In the case of negatively charged polymers (e.g., alginate, CMC), positively charged ligands (e.g., polylysine, polyethyleneimine) of different molecular weights can be ionically attached.
IV. Formulations
Formulations and pharmaceutical compositions containing an effective amount of the composition in a pharmaceutical carrier appropriate for administration to an individual in need thereof to treat one or more symptoms of cancer are provided. The formulations are designed for administration parenterally (e.g., by intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous injection or infusion). It may also be possible to administer topically (e.g., to a mucosal surface such as the mouth, lungs, intranasal, intravaginally, etc.). The compositions designed to be administered locally or systemically.
The compositions can be formulated for immediate release, extended release, or modified release. A delayed release dosage form is one that releases a drug (or drugs) at a time other than promptly after administration. An extended release dosage form is one that allows at least a twofold reduction in dosing frequency as compared to that drug presented as a conventional dosage form (e.g. as a solution or prompt drug-releasing, conventional solid dosage form). A modified release dosage form is one for which the drug release characteristics of time course and/or location are chosen to accomplish therapeutic or convenience objectives not offered by conventional dosage forms such as solutions, ointments, or promptly dissolving dosage forms. Delayed release and extended release dosage forms and their combinations are types of modified release dosage forms.
Formulations are prepared using a pharmaceutically acceptable “carrier” composed of materials that are considered safe and effective and may be administered to an individual without causing undesirable biological side effects or unwanted interactions. The “carrier” is all components present in the pharmaceutical formulation other than the active ingredient or ingredients.
Generally, pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared by reaction of the free acid or base forms of an active agent with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, non-aqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include salts of an active agent derived from inorganic acids, organic acids, alkali metal salts, and alkaline earth metal salts as well as salts formed by reaction of the drug with a suitable organic ligand (e.g., quaternary ammonium salts). Lists of suitable salts are found, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, Md., 2000, p. 704.
In some embodiments, the targeted agent is incorporated into or encapsulated by a nanoparticle, microparticle, micelle, synthetic lipoprotein particle, or carbon nanotube. For example, the compositions can be incorporated into a vehicle such as polymeric microparticles which provide controlled release of the active agent. In some embodiments, release of the modulator is controlled by diffusion of the targeted agent out of the microparticles and/or degradation of the polymeric particles by hydrolysis and/or enzymatic degradation. Suitable polymers include ethylcellulose and other natural or synthetic cellulose derivatives. Polymers which are slowly soluble and form a gel in an aqueous environment, such as hydroxypropyl methylcellulose or polyethylene oxide may also be suitable as materials for drug containing microparticles. Other polymers include, but are not limited to, polyanhydrides, poly (ester anhydrides), polyhydroxy acids, such as polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), poly-3-hydroxybut rate (PHB) and copolymers thereof, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate (P4HB) and copolymers thereof, polycaprolactone and copolymers thereof, and combinations thereof.
The targeted agent can be incorporated into or prepared from materials which are insoluble in aqueous solution or slowly soluble in aqueous solution, but are capable of degrading within the GI tract by means including enzymatic degradation, surfactant action of bile acids, and/or mechanical erosion. As used herein, the term “slowly soluble in water” refers to materials that are not dissolved in water within a period of 30 minutes. Preferred examples include fats, fatty substances, waxes, waxlike substances and mixtures thereof. Suitable fats and fatty substances include fatty alcohols (such as lauryl, myristyl stearyl, cetyl or cetostearyl alcohol), fatty acids and derivatives, including, but not limited to, fatty acid esters, fatty acid glycerides (mono-, di- and tri-glycerides), and hydrogenated fats. Specific examples include, but are not limited to, hydrogenated vegetable oil, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, hydrogenated castor oil, hydrogenated oils available under the trade name Sterotex®, stearic acid, cocoa butter, and stearyl alcohol. Suitable waxes and wax-like materials include natural or synthetic waxes, hydrocarbons, and normal waxes.
Specific examples of waxes include beeswax, glycowax, castor wax, carnauba wax, paraffins and candelilla wax. As used herein, a wax-like material is defined as any material which is normally solid at room temperature and has a melting point of from about 30 to 300° C.
Parenteral Formulations
The composition, for example, a modulator of cancer cell metabolism having a cancer cell-targeting moiety associated with, linked, conjugated, or otherwise attached directly or indirectly to the modulator of cancer cell metabolism, or to a nanoparticle or other delivery vehicle thereof can be formulated for parenteral delivery, such as injection or infusion, in the form of a solution or suspension, or a powder. The formulation can be administered via any route, such as, the blood stream or directly to the organ or tissue to be treated. The particles may be provided in a lyophilized or dried form in a unit dosage form, for suspension at the time of injection. These may be provided in a kit with an appropriate amount of diluent such as sterile water or buffered solution.
Parenteral formulations can be prepared as aqueous compositions using techniques known in the art. Typically, such compositions can be prepared as injectable formulations, for example, solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for using to prepare solutions or suspensions upon the addition of a reconstitution medium prior to injection; emulsions, such as water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions, oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions, and microemulsions thereof, liposomes, or emulsomes.
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, one or more polyols (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), oils, such as vegetable oils (e.g., peanut oil, corn oil, sesame oil, etc.), and combinations thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride.
Solutions and dispersions of the compounds or nanoparticles can be prepared in water or another solvent or dispersing medium suitably mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients including, but not limited to, surfactants, dispersants, emulsifiers, pH modifying agents, and combination thereof.
Suitable surfactants may be anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic surface active agents.

Suitable preservatives include, but are not limited to, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and thimerosal. The formulation may also contain an antioxidant to prevent degradation of the active agent(s) or nanoparticles.
The formulation is typically buffered to a pH of between 3 and 8 for parenteral administration upon reconstitution. Suitable buffers include, but are not limited to, phosphate buffers, acetate buffers, and citrate buffers.
Water soluble polymers are often used in formulations for parenteral administration. Suitable water-soluble polymers include, but are not limited to, polyvinylpyrrolidone, dextran, carboxymethylcellulose, and polyethylene glycol.
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compound or nanoparticles in the required amount in the appropriate solvent or dispersion medium with one or more of the excipients listed above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized compositions into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those listed above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the compound or nanoparticle plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. The powders can be prepared in such a manner that the particles are porous in nature, which can increase dissolution of the particles. Methods for making porous particles are well known in the art.
Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration are preferably in the form of a sterile aqueous solution or suspension of particles formed from one or more polymer-drug conjugates. Acceptable solvents include, for example, water, Ringer's solution, phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and isotonic sodium chloride solution. The formulation may also be a sterile solution, suspension, or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as 1,3-butanediol.
In some instances, the formulation is distributed or packaged in a liquid form. Alternatively, formulations for parenteral administration can be packed as a solid, obtained, for example by lyophilization of a suitable liquid formulation. The solid can be reconstituted with an appropriate carrier or diluent prior to administration.
Solutions, suspensions, or emulsions for parenteral administration may be buffered with an effective amount of buffer necessary to maintain a pH suitable for ocular administration. Suitable buffers are well known by those skilled in the art and some examples of useful buffers are acetate, borate, carbonate, citrate, and phosphate buffers.

V. Methods of Use
Methods of using the compositions to treat cancer are provided. Methods of using the compositions to treat other diseases, disorders and injury including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc.; inflammatory diseases, including, but not limited to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis, are also provided.
Methods of using the compositions to treat cancer are provided. The methods typically include administering a subject in a need thereof an effective amount of a composition including a targeted agent which contains a modulator of cancer metabolism.
In the most preferred embodiments, methods of using the compositions lead to (a) direct or indirect inhibition of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation or any other form of metabolism that utilizes glucose or equivalents from the disease area's microenvironment or direct or indirect inhibition of the uptake of glucose or equivalents from the disease area microenvironment, and/or (b) direct or indirect inhibition of the production of lactate or equivalents, or the direct or indirect inhibition of the release of lactate or equivalents into the disease microenvironment.
Modulating cancer metabolism can modify the tumor microenvironment amenable for an immune response against the cancer cells. In some embodiments, treatment using the compositions increases the number or activity of immune cells, for example, tumor associated immune cells, relative to the number or activity of the immune cells prior to administration of the targeted agent, or compared to administration of the targeted agent absent a targeting moiety, a delivery vehicle, or a combination thereof. The immune cells can include, but are not limited to, CD4 cells and CD8 cells. In some embodiments, the compositions increase the number of CD4 or CD8 cells in the tumor. In some embodiments, the increase in immune cells is an increase in the total number of immune cells. In some embodiments, the increase in immune cells is an increase in the ratio of immune cells to tumor cells. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the increase in immune cells is actually the results of a reduction in tumor cells. In some embodiments, treatment using the compositions leads to a decrease in expression of a regulator of immune suppression (or suppressor of immune activation) such as PD-1, CTLA4, or a combination thereof.
A. Treatment Regimen
A treatment regimen can include one or multiple administrations of the compositions for achieving a desired physiological change, including administering to an animal, such as a mammal, especially a human being, an effective amount of the compositions to treat the disease or symptom thereof, or to produce the physiological change.
1. Dosage and Effective Amounts
A therapeutically effective amounts of targeted agents used in the treatment of cancer are typically sufficient to reduce or alleviate one or more symptoms of cancer. Symptoms of cancer may be physical, such as tumor burden, or biological such as proliferation of cancer cells. Accordingly, the amount of modulator can be effective to, for example, kill tumor cells or inhibit proliferation or metastasis of the tumor cells. Preferably the modulator, for example via the targeting moiety, is preferentially delivered cancer cells. Preferably the modulator does not target or otherwise modulate the metabolism of non-cancer cells, particular immune cells such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or does so at a reduced level compared to cancer (e.g. tumor) cells. In this way, by-products and other affects associated with aberrant metabolism in cancer cells are reduced, preferably leading directly or indirectly to cancer cell death. In some embodiments, the targeted agent reduces cancer cell migration, angiogenesis, immune escape, radioresistance, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the targeted agent induces a change in the cancer cell itself or its microenvironment that reduces suppression or induces activation of an immune response against the cancer cell. For example, in some embodiments, the composition is administered in an effective amount to enhance and/or prolonging the activation of T cells (i.e., increasing antigen-specific proliferation of T cells, enhance cytokine production by T cells, stimulate differentiation, stimulate effector functions of T cells and/or promote T cell survival) or overcome T cell exhaustion and/or anergy.
The actual effective amounts of modulator can vary according to factors including the specific modulator administered, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration, and the age, weight, condition of the subject being treated, as well as the route of administration and the disease or disorder.
The therapeutic result of the targeted agents can be compared to a control. Suitable controls are known in the art. A typical control is a comparison of a condition or symptom of a subject prior to and after administration of the targeted agent. The condition or symptom can be a biochemical, molecular, physiological, or pathological readout. For example, the effect of the composition on a particular symptom, pharmacologic, or physiologic indicator can be compared to an untreated subject, or the condition of the subject prior to treatment. In some embodiments, the symptom, pharmacologic, or physiologic indicator is measured in a subject prior to treatment, and again one or more times after treatment is initiated. In some embodiments, the control is a reference level, or average determined based on measuring the symptom, pharmacologic, or physiologic indicator in one or more subjects that do not have the disease or condition to be treated (e.g., healthy subjects). In some embodiments, the effect of the treatment is compared to a conventional treatment that is known the art, such as one of those discussed herein.
In some embodiments, the effective amount of targeted agents causes little or no killing of non-cancerous cells, and preferably little or no inhibition of metabolism in non-cancer cells. It is particularly preferred that the composition have little or no effect on immune cells such as TIL.
In some embodiments, dosages are administered once, twice, or three times daily, or every other day, two days, three days, four days, five days, or six days to a human. In some embodiments, dosages are administered about once or twice every week, every two weeks, every three weeks, or every four weeks. In some embodiments, dosages are administered about once or twice every month, every two months, every three months, every four months, every five months, or every six months.
In some embodiments, the regimen includes one or more cycles of a round of therapy followed by a drug holiday (e.g., no drug). The round of the therapy can be, for example, and of the administrations discussed above. Likewise, the drug holiday can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days; or 1, 2, 3, 4 weeks, or 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 months.
In particular embodiments, the subject is administered a dosage of between about 6 mg/kg and 18 mg/kg. Particular dosage regimens include, for example, one or more cycles in which the subject is administered the drug each of five days in a row, followed by a two-day drug holiday.
B. Combination Therapies and Procedures
The compositions can be administered alone or in combination with one or more conventional therapies, for example, a conventional cancer therapy. In some embodiments, the conventional therapy includes administration of one or more of the compositions in combination with one or more additional active agents. The combination therapies can include administration of the active agents together in the same admixture, or in separate admixtures. Therefore, in some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition includes two, three, or more active agents. Such formulations typically include an effective amount of a modulator of cancer cell metabolism. The additional active agent(s) can have the same, or different mechanisms of action. In some embodiments, the combination results in an additive effect on the treatment of the cancer. In some embodiments, the combinations result in a more than additive effect on the treatment of the disease or disorder.
The additional therapy or procedure can be simultaneous or sequential with the combination therapy. In some embodiment the additional therapy is performed between drug cycles or during a drug holiday that is part of the compositions dosage regime. For example, in some embodiments, the additional therapy or procedure is surgery, a radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.
Additional therapeutic agents include conventional cancer therapeutics such as chemotherapeutic agents, cytokines, chemokines, and radiation therapy. The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs can be divided into: alkylating agents, antimetabolites, anthracyclines, plant alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and other antitumour agents. All of these drugs affect cell division or DNA synthesis and function in some way. Additional therapeutics include monoclonal antibodies and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors e.g., imatinib mesylate (GLEEVEC® or GLIVEC®), which directly targets a molecular abnormality in certain types of cancer (chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors).
Representative chemotherapeutic agents include, but are not limited to, amsacrine, bleomycin, busulfan, capecitabine, carboplatin, carmustine, chlorambucil, cisplatin, cladribine, clofarabine, crisantaspase, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dacarbazine, dactinomycin, daunorubicin, docetaxel, doxorubicin, epipodophyllotoxins, epirubicin, etoposide, etoposide phosphate, fludarabine, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, hydroxycarbamide, idarubicin, ifosfamide, innotecan, leucovorin, liposomal doxorubicin, liposomal daunorubici, lomustine, mechlorethamine, melphalan, mercaptopurine, mesna, methotrexate, mitomycin, mitoxantrone, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, pemetrexed, pentostatin, procarbazine, raltitrexed, satraplatin, streptozocin, teniposide, tegafur-uracil, temozolomide, teniposide, thiotepa, tioguanine, topotecan, treosulfan, vinblastine, vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine, taxol and derivatives thereof, trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®), cetuximab, and rituximab (RITUXAN® or MABTHERA®), bevacizumab (AVASTIN®), and combinations thereof. Representative pro-apoptotic agents include, but are not limited to, fludarabinetaurosporine, cycloheximide, actinomycin D, lactosylceramide, 15d-PGJ(2)5 and combinations thereof.
In some embodiments, the compositions and methods are used prior to or in conjunction with an immunotherapy such inhibition of checkpoint proteins such as PD-1 or CTLA-4, adoptive T cell therapy, and/or a cancer vaccine. Methods of adoptive T cell therapy are known in the art and used in clinical practice. Generally adoptive T cell therapy involves the isolation and ex vivo expansion of tumor specific T cells to achieve greater number of T cells than what could be obtained by vaccination alone. The tumor specific T cells are then infused into patients with cancer in an attempt to give their immune system the ability to overwhelm remaining tumor via T cells, which can attack and kill the cancer. Several forms of adoptive T cell therapy can be used for cancer treatment including, but not limited to, culturing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes or TIL; isolating and expanding one particular T cell or clone; and using T cells that have been engineered to recognize and attack tumors. In some embodiments, the T cells are taken directly from the patient's blood. Methods of priming and activating T cells in vitro for adaptive T cell cancer therapy are known in the art. See, for example, Wang, et al, Blood, 109(11):4865-4872 (2007) and Hervas-Stubbs, et al, J. Immunol., 189(7):3299-310 (2012).
Historically, adoptive T cell therapy strategies have largely focused on the infusion of tumor antigen specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) which can directly kill tumor cells. However, CD4+ T helper (Th) cells such as Th1, Th2, Tfh, Treg, and Th17 can also be used. Th can activate antigen-specific effector cells and recruit cells of the innate immune system such as macrophages and dendritic cells to assist in antigen presentation (APC), and antigen primed Th cells can directly activate tumor antigen-specific CTL. As a result of activating APC, antigen specific Th1 have been implicated as the initiators of epitope or determinant spreading which is a broadening of immunity to other antigens in the tumor. The ability to elicit epitope spreading broadens the immune response to many potential antigens in the tumor and can lead to more efficient tumor cell kill due to the ability to mount a heterogeneic response. In this way, adoptive T cell therapy can used to stimulate endogenous immunity.
In some embodiments, the T cells express a chimeric antigen receptor (CARs, CAR T cells, or CARTs). Artificial T cell receptors are engineered receptors, which graft a particular specificity onto an immune effector cell. Typically, these receptors are used to graft the specificity of a monoclonal antibody onto a T cell and can be engineered to target virtually any tumor associated antigen. First generation CARs typically had the intracellular domain from the CD3 ζ-chain, which is the primary transmitter of signals from endogenous TCRs. Second generation CARs add intracellular signaling domains from various costimulatory protein receptors (e.g., CD28, 41BB, ICOS) to the cytoplasmic tail of the CAR to provide additional signals to the T cell, and third generation CARs combine multiple signaling domains, such as CD3z-CD28-41BB or CD3z-CD28-OX40, to further enhance effectiveness.
In some embodiments, the compositions and methods are used prior to or in conjunction with a cancer vaccine, for example a dendritic cell cancer vaccine. Vaccination typically includes administering a subject an antigen (e.g., a cancer antigen) together with an adjuvant to elicit therapeutic T cells in vivo. In some embodiments, the cancer vaccine is a dendritic cell cancer vaccine in which the antigen delivered by dendritic cells primed ex vivo to present the cancer antigen. Examples include, for example, PROVENGE® (sipuleucel-T), which is a dendritic cell-based vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer (Ledford, et al., Nature, 519, 17-18 (5 Mar. 2015). Such vaccines and other compositions and methods for immunotherapy are reviewed in Palucka, et al., Nature Reviews Cancer, 12, 265-277 (April 2012).
In some embodiments, the compositions and methods are used prior to or in conjunction with surgical removal of tumors, for example, in preventing primary tumor metastasis. In some embodiments, the compositions and methods are used to enhance body's own anti-tumor immune functions.
C. Subjects to be Treated
In general, the compositions and methods of treatment thereof are useful in the context of cancer, including tumor therapy. The compositions can also be used for treatment of other diseases, disorders and injury including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Alzheimer's, Huntington's, etc.; inflammatory diseases, including, but not limited to ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.
In some embodiments, the subject to be treated is a human. All the methods described can include the step of identifying and selecting a subject in need of treatment, or a subject who would benefit from administration with the described compositions.
1. Proliferative Disorders
In some embodiments, the compositions and methods of treatment thereof are useful for treatment of abnormal cellular proliferation such as cancer or endometriosis.
In a mature animal, a balance usually is maintained between cell renewal and cell death in most organs and tissues. The various types of mature cells in the body have a given life span; as these cells die, new cells are generated by the proliferation and differentiation of various types of stem cells. Under normal circumstances, the production of new cells is so regulated that the numbers of any particular type of cell remain constant. Occasionally, though, cells arise that are no longer responsive to normal growth-control mechanisms. These cells give rise to clones of cells that can expand to a considerable size, producing a tumor or neoplasm. A tumor that is not capable of indefinite growth and does not invade the healthy surrounding tissue extensively is benign. A tumor that continues to grow and becomes progressively invasive is malignant. The term cancer refers specifically to a malignant tumor. In addition to uncontrolled growth, malignant tumors exhibit metastasis. In this process, small clusters of cancerous cells dislodge from a tumor, invade the blood or lymphatic vessels, and are carried to other tissues, where they continue to proliferate. In this way a primary tumor at one site can give rise to a secondary tumor at another site.
The compositions and methods described herein are useful for treating subjects having benign or malignant tumors by delaying or inhibiting the growth of a tumor in a subject, reducing the growth or size of the tumor, inhibiting or reducing metastasis of the tumor, and/or inhibiting or reducing symptoms associated with tumor development or growth.
Malignant tumors which may be treated are classified herein according to the embryonic origin of the tissue from which the tumor is derived. Carcinomas are tumors arising from endodermal or ectodermal tissues such as skin or the epithelial lining of internal organs and glands. The compositions are particularly effective in treating carcinomas. Sarcomas, which arise less frequently, are derived from mesodermal connective tissues such as bone, fat, and cartilage. The leukemias and lymphomas are malignant tumors of hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow. Leukemias proliferate as single cells, whereas lymphomas tend to grow as tumor masses. Malignant tumors may show up at numerous organs or tissues of the body to establish a cancer.
The types of cancer that can be treated with the provided compositions and methods include, but are not limited to, cancers such as vascular cancer such as multiple myeloma, adenocarcinomas and sarcomas, of bone, bladder, brain, breast, cervical, colorectal, esophageal, kidney, liver, lung, nasopharangeal, pancreatic, prostate, skin, stomach, and uterine. In some embodiments, the compositions are used to treat multiple cancer types concurrently. The compositions can also be used to treat metastases or tumors at multiple locations.

In some embodiments, the cancers are characterized as being triple negative breast cancer, or having one or more KRAS-mutations, EGFR mutations, ALK mutations, RB1 mutations, HIF mutations, KEAP mutations, NRF mutations, or other metabolic-related mutations, or combinations thereof. The methods and compounds as described herein are useful for both prophylactic and therapeutic treatment.
Therapeutic treatment involves administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compositions or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as described after cancer is diagnosed.
In further embodiments, the described compositions are used for prophylactic use i.e. prevention, delay in onset, diminution, eradication, or delay in exacerbation of signs or symptoms after onset, and prevention of relapse. For prophylactic use, a therapeutically effective amount of the compounds and compositions or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof as described are administered to a subject prior to onset (e.g., before obvious signs of cancer), during early onset (e.g., upon initial signs and symptoms of cancer), or after an established development of cancer. Prophylactic administration can occur for several days to years prior to the manifestation of symptoms. Prophylactic administration can be used, for example, in the chemopreventative treatment of subjects presenting precancerous lesions, those diagnosed with early stage malignancies, and for subgroups with susceptibilities (e.g., family, racial, and/or occupational) to particular cancers.
2. Neurodegenerative Diseases
The compositions and methods can also be used to delivery active agents for the treatment of a neurological or neurodegenerative disease or disorder or central nervous system disorder. The methods typically include administering the subject an effective amount of the disclosed composition to increase cognition or reduce a decline in cognition, increase a cognitive function or reduce a decline in a cognitive function, increase memory or reduce a decline in memory, increase the ability or capacity to learn or reduce a decline in the ability or capacity to learn, or a combination thereof.
Neurodegeneration refers to the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons, including death of neurons. For example, the compositions and methods can be used to treat subjects with a disease or disorder, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and PD-related disorders, Huntington's Disease (HD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and other dementias, Prion Diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, Corticobasal Degeneration, Frontotemporal Dementia, HIV-Related Cognitive Impairment, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Motor Neuron Diseases (MND), Spinocerebellar Ataxia (SCA), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), Friedreich's Ataxia, Lewy Body Disease, Alpers' Disease, Batten Disease, Cerebro-Oculo-Facio-Skeletal Syndrome, Corticobasal Degeneration, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker Disease, Kuru, Leigh's Disease, Monomelic Amyotrophy, Multiple System Atrophy, Multiple System Atrophy With Orthostatic Hypotension (Shy-Drager Syndrome), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation, Opsoclonus Myoclonus, Posterior Cortical Atrophy, Primary Progressive Aphasia, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Vascular Dementia, Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), Lacunar syndromes, Hydrocephalus, Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome, post-encephalitic dementia, cancer and chemotherapy-associated cognitive impairment and dementia, and depression-induced dementia and pseudodementia.
In some embodiments, the subject has a central nervous system disorder or is in need of neuroprotection. Exemplary conditions and/or subjects include, but are not limited to, subjects having had, subjects with, or subjects likely to develop or suffer from a stroke, a traumatic brain injury, a spinal cord injury, Post-Traumatic Stress syndrome, or a combination thereof.
In some embodiments, the compositions and methods are administered to a subject in need thereof in an effective amount to reduce, or prevent one or more molecular or clinical symptoms of a neurodegenerative disease, or one or more mechanisms that cause neurodegeneration. Neurodegeneration, and diseases and disorders thereof, can be caused by a genetic mutation or mutations; protein mis-folding; intracellular mechanisms such as dysregulated protein degradation pathways, membrane damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, or defects in axonal transport; defects in programmed cell death mechanisms including apoptosis, autophagy, cytoplasmic cell death; and combinations thereof. More specific mechanisms common to neurodegenerative disorders include, for example, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, inflammatory changes, iron accumulation, and/or protein aggregation.
Symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases are known in the art and vary from disease to disease. In some embodiments, the disease exhibits or is characterized by one or any combination of the following symptoms or diseases: stress, anxiety, seasonal depression, insomnia and tiredness, schizophrenia, panic attacks, melancholy, dysfunction in the regulation of appetite, insomnia, psychotic problems, epilepsy, senile dementia, various disorders resulting from normal or pathological aging, migraine, memory loss, disorders of cerebral circulation, cardiovascular pathologies, pathologies of the digestive system, fatigue due to appetite disorders, obesity, pain, psychotic disorders, diabetes, senile dementia, or sexual dysfunction. In some embodiments, the subject does not exhibit one or more of the preceding symptoms.
In some embodiments, the subject has been medically diagnosed as having a neurodegenerative disease or a condition in need of neuroprotection by exhibiting clinical (e.g., physical) symptoms of the disease. Therefore, in some embodiments, the compounds or compositions disclosed herein are administered prior to a clinical diagnosis of a disease or condition. In some embodiments, a genetic test indicates that the subject has one or more genetic mutations associated with a neurodegenerative disease or central nervous system disorder.
Neurodegenerative diseases are typically more common in aged individuals.
Active agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are well known in the art and can vary based on the symptoms and disease to be treated. For example, conventional treatment for Parkinson's disease can include levodopa (usually combined with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor or COMT inhibitor), a dopamine agonist, or an MAO-B inhibitor.
Treatment for Huntington's disease can include a dopamine blocker to help reduce abnormal behaviors and movements, or a drug such as amantadine and tetrabenazine to control movement, etc. Other drugs that help to reduce chorea include neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Compounds such as amantadine or remacemide have shown preliminary positive results. Hypokinesia and rigidity, especially in juvenile cases, can be treated with antiparkinsonian drugs, and myoclonic hyperkinesia can be treated with valproic acid. Psychiatric symptoms can be treated with medications similar to those used in the general population. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine have been recommended for depression, while atypical antipsychotic drugs are recommended for psychosis and behavioral problems.
Riluzole (RILUTEK®) (2-amino-6-(trifluoromethoxy) benzothiazole), an antiexcitotoxin, has yielded improved survival time in subjects with ALS. Other medications, most used off-label, and interventions can reduce symptoms due to ALS. Some treatments improve quality of life and a few appear to extend life. Common ALS-related therapies are reviewed in Gordon, Aging and Disease, 4(5):295-310 (2013), see, e.g., Table 1 therein. A number of other agents have been tested in one or more clinical trials with efficacies ranging from non-efficacious to promising. Exemplary agents are reviewed in Carlesi, et al., Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 149:151-167 (2011).

EXAMPLES
Example 1: Synthesis and Stability of β-alanyl DCA (ADCA)
Synthesis from DCA
β-alanine (2 g, 22 mmol) and NaHCO3 (4.6 g, 55 mmol) were suspended in water/THF mixture (2:1, 30 mL) and DCA chloride (2 mL, 24.2 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was added to the mixture dropwise at 0° C. The solution was stirred for 2 hr at RT, diluted to 100 mL with NaHCO3 and washed with ether 3×50 mL. The aqueous layer was acidified with 1 M HCl to pH 2 and extracted with DCM 5×50 mL. The organic fraction was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. The residue was precipitated into hexanes, to give the product as white powder (99% pure, small amount of DCA as an impurity). Yield: 84 mg (2%). The synthesis route of β-alanyl DCA is shown below.

Synthesis from DCA Anhydride
ADCA can also be prepared using alternative method such as the following: β-alanine (2 g, 22 mmol) was suspended in DCM (30 mL) and DCA anhydride (4 mL, 26.4 mmol) was added to the mixture. The solution stirred for three days and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was triturated in ether/hexanes 1:2 (150 mL) and left at −20 for 1 h. The resulting precipitate was filtered off. The product was recrystallized two times using 1:1 ether/hexanes mixture. Yield 3.7 g, 84%, colorless crystals.
This synthesis route of β-alanyl DCA is shown below in Scheme VII.
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00041.TIF </img>
ADCA is Stable in Serum
Stability of ADCA in cell culture media containing 10% FBS was examined by looking at the HPLC chromatograms and area under the peaks. For the study, 1.5 mM solution of ADCA was prepared by mixing 10 μL of 100 mM DMSO stock solution with 1.99 mL of cell media. Turbidity was observed after mixing, however no precipitate was observed. The samples were then stored at 37° C., 150 μL aliquots were analyzed by HPLC (the sample was mixed before taking an aliquot, however no visible precipitate was observed even before mixing). Alanyl-DCA was detected at 205 nm with a retention time of 9.7 min on HPLC. The total area of absorbance peak indicated virtually no change in ADCA concentration over five days.
Example 2: Stability of TPP-Tris-β-alanino-DCA (Mito-ADCA)
Synthesis of TPP-Tris-β-alanino-DCA (Mito-ADCA)
MitoADCA was prepared in two steps. The synthesis route of TPP-Tris-β-alanino-DCA is shown below in Scheme VIII.
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00042.TIF </img>
TPP-tris-OH was reacted with Boc protected beta-alanine using EDC, DMAP reagents in DMF solvent. DMF was removed and the product was purified by column chromatography.
To the solution of BOC protected compound in DCM, excess TFA was added, stirred 30 min to remove the BOC group. After concentration, this residue was dissolved in DCM, and Pyridine was added. To this mixture, DCA anhydride was added drop-wise, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. The solution was washed with 0.1% H2SO4-Brine, and dried over MgSO4. After concentration, the residue was purified by column chromatography. HPLC analysis of the resultant compound showed 2 peaks. From mass and NMR analysis it was concluded that the second product is a molecule similar to Mito-ADCA, where one of DCA was replaced with TFA. This exchange with TFA might have happened during the BOC deprotection. In further attempts, TFA was replaced by HCl/dioxane to deprotect the BOC group and the product was pure from NMR and HPLC.
Stability of Mito-ADCA
Stability of Mito-ADCA in cell culture media containing 10% FBS was monitored by examining the HPLC chromatograms and area under the peaks. Scheme below expected degradation products:
<img> id-US20180028647A1-20180201-C00043.TIF </img>
For this study, 500 μM solution of Mito-ADCA (MAD) was prepared by mixing 10 μL of 100 mM DMSO stock solution with 1.99 mL of cell culture media (RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Pen/strep). Turbidity was observed after mixing, however no precipitate was observed. The samples were then stored at 37° C., 150 μL aliquots were analyzed by HPLC (the sample was mixed before taking an aliquot, and no visible precipitate was observed even before mixing).
The analysis of the solution after centrifugation showed presence of MAD in the precipitate. Using HPLC, MitoADCA (MAD), loss of one alanylDCA (MAD-ADCA), loss of three alanyl-DCA (i.e., TPP-Tris-OH) and the alanyl-DCA (ADCA) were tracked. MAD was detected and monitored at 268 nm with retention time of 18.08 min, Mito-A-DCA missing 1 alanyl DCA at 268 nm with retention time of 17.13 min, total amount of MAD and Mito-A-DCA missing 1 alanyl DCA at 268 nm, TPP-Tris-OH at 268 nm with retention time of 14.6 min, and alanyl DCA at 205 nm with retention time of 9.5 min. The MAD half-life in cell media at 500 μM was measured as ˜20 h. TPP-Tris-OH starts appearing in HPLC only after 10 h in media. Alanyl-DCA is released as a result of hydrolysis instead of DCA.
In a further study, Mito-ADCA stability testing was carried out in rat serum. 0.5 mg/mL solutions 18% rat serum were prepared and analyzed by HPLC. Mito-ADCA was detected at 268 nm with a retention time of 18.08 min over time of 4500 min in 18% rat serum. Mito-ADCA exhibited a half-life in serum of around 7 h. Alanyl-DCA is released as a result of hydrolysis instead of DCA. After 2d a peak of TPP-Tris-OH was observed. The amount of TPP-Tris-OH corresponded to 76% of the original. Mito-ADCA was stable in water for 2 days without signs of decomposition.
Example 3: Synthesis of TPP-alanino-DCA (TPP-ADCA)
The solution of 4-bromobutyltriphenylphosphonium bromide and sodium azide in the mixture of ethanol (“EtOH”) and water was stirred under reflux for overnight. The solvent was evaporated and residue was dissolved in DCM-EtOH (9:1) and filtered with filter paper. The filtrate was concentrated to give a desired compound (99% Yield). The product was confirmed by NMR.

Example 5: Synthesis and Stability of TPP-ib-DCA
Synthesis of TPP-ib-DCA
Synthesis of TPP-ib-DCA was carried out in two steps starting from TPP-aminehydrochloride. A solution of DCC (260 mg, 1.26 mmol) in DCM (5 mL) was added to a stirred solution of TPP-amine (500 mg, 1.26 mmol), acid (1.05 mmol), HOSu (213 mg, 1.57 mmol), and triethylamine (290 μL, 2.1 mmol) and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. The urea was filtered off and the residue was purified by column chromatography using 5 to 20% MeOH in DCM. Yield 258 mg.
A solution of dichloroacetic anhydride (220 μL, 1.43 mmol) and (4-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanamido)butyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (200 mg, 0.48 mmol) in DCM (10 mL) was stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution was concentrated and the product was purified by precipitation into diethyl ether two times. The product was purified by chromatography.

Stability of TPP-ib-DCA
Hydrolytic stability of TPP-ibDCA in serum, and in water was studied. A 500 μg/mL solution of TPP-ib-DCA in water, and in 18% rat serum was analyzed by HPLC using the method for Mito-ADCA/DCA detection described above. The total area of absorbance peaks of each compound on HPLC chromatograms at a specified detection wavelength was monitored over time: TPP-ib-DCA in 18% rate serum was detected at 268 nm with retention time of 17.7 min; DCA in 18% rate serum was detected at 205 nm with retention time of 4.8 min; TPP-ib-DCA in water was detected at 268 nm with retention time of 17.7 min; DCA in water was detected at 205 nm with retention time of 4.8 min. The hydrolysis in serum seems to be slower than MitoDCA. Surprisingly, the appearance of free DCA is delayed relative to the disappearance of the ester. In water, hydrolysis of TPP-ib-DCA stops halfway likely due to the acidification of the solution.

Preparation of PDCA Encapsulated Nanoparticles
PDCA was encapsulated in PLGA-PEG block copolymers to prepare PDCA encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs). PLGA-PEG-OH was used to prepare non-targeted (NT)-NPs, while PLGA-PEG-TPP was used to prepare Targeted (T)-NPs. Some T-NP formulations were prepared using mixture of PLGA-PEG-OH and PLGA-PEG-TPP polymers for varying charge and better stability of encapsulated PDCA. Table 1 provides various characterization details of these nanoparticles. As expected the NT-PDCA-NP formulations show small sizes and negative charges, while the T-PDCA-NP formulations show small size with positive charge. The loadings increase with increase of feed PDCA amount with respect to polymer and encapsulation efficiencies are 50-100% range. All the targeted NP compositions showed some degradation of DCA from PDCA and the respective PDCA analogs with the loss of one DCA or two DCA were visible in the HPLC.

Stability of PDCA-NPs
The stability of PDCA encapsulated nanoparticles was tested over a period of 7 weeks. A 20 mg/mL batch of PDCA-NPs were stored at 4° C. for 46 days without stabilizer and in another batch of 20 mg/mL of PDCA-NPs were stored with sucrose as a stabilizer for 9 and 32 days at −20° C. Size, charge, PDCA concentrations were monitored over time.
To summarize, the size, charge and drug concentrations were unchanged for samples stored at −20° C. with the stabilizer. However hydrolysis of PDCA resulting in loss of DCA increased with time for the sample stored at 4° C. The shelf life at 4° C. was about 14 days. At −20° C. no significant degradation was observed even after 32 days.

The loading was 3.4% with encapsulation efficiency of 6.9%. The resulting Tetradecyl 3-BP nanoparticles had z-average diameter of 89.53 nm (PDI=0.153) and zeta-potential of 45.7 mV. The loading was 14.16% with encapsulation efficiency of 14.16%.
Larger nanoparticles for OMM targeting were prepared by a following method. Octyl 3-BP or Tetradecyl 3-BP in acetonitrile (1 mL, 5 mg/mL) was added dropwise to 10 mL of water and stirred for 2 h. After 2 h a solution of PLGA-PEG-TPP in acetonitrile (1 mL, 5 mg/mL) was added dropwise and the resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h. Particles were purified by Amicon filtration 3 times. The resulting Octyl 3-BP nanoparticles had z-average diameter of 219.2 nm (PDI=0.178) and zeta-potential of 47.2 mV. The loading was 7.7% with encapsulation efficiency of 7.7% (Table 5).

The targeted Octyl 3-BP nanoparticle size could be increased further by increasing the ratio of Octyl 3-BP to the targeted polymer. For instance, by starting with 1 mL of 10 mg/mL solution of Octyl 3-BP the nanoparticles that had z-average diameter of 269.6 nm (PDI=0.212) and zeta-potential of 40.0 mV. The loading was 16.0% with encapsulation efficiency of 8.0%.

Stability of Oct3BP-NPs
The storage stabilities of Oct3-BP encapsulated nanoparticles were monitored over a period of 7 weeks. Two batches of Oct3BP-NPs were stored at −20° C. for 17 and 46 days with sucrose stabilizer and thawed and stored at 4° C. One batch of Oct3BP-NPs were stored at −4° C. without stabilizer. Size, charge, and 3BP concentration were monitored.
Minimal changes were observed for nanoparticle size and charge regardless of their storage conditions. The loading decreases with time for both 4° C., and −20° C. storage conditions. Storage at −20° C. has only a small beneficial effect on stability compared to when stored at 4° C. without any stabilizer. The shelf life for 10% loss in concentration was observed after 22 days at 4° C. and 27 days at −20° C.

Example 12: Nanoparticles with PalmTrisEthoxyEthanol (PTEE)
Synthesis of PalmTrisEthoxyEthanol (PTEE)
PTEE was prepared from ethoxy ethanol in two steps. In first step, ethoxy ethanol (1.98 g, 22 mmoles) was dissolved in dichloromethane. To this solution, succinic anhydride (2 g, 20 mmoles) was added along with catalytic amount of dimethyl amino pyridine (121 mg, 2 mmoles). Solution was stirred under reflux overnight. Solution was concentrated and product was purified by column chromatography using DCM and MeOH. Yield: 88%.
In the second step, the Palm-Tris-OH (309 mg, 1 mmol) and ethoxyethylsuccinic acid (1.14 g, 6 mmoles) along with EDC (1.15 g, 6 mmoles), and DMAP (121 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in DMF and stirred overnight at 60° C. The reaction mixture was washed with 0.1% sulfuric acid containing brine, followed by wash with bicarbonate solution and finally brine solution. The solution was concentrated and purified by column chromatography using hexane and acetone. And the product PTEE was isolated in 92% yield. Purity of the product was confirmed by NMR and HPLC. The synthesis route of PalmTrisEthoxyEthanol is shown in Scheme XXI.

Example 13: Synthesis of Palmityl-bis-Lonidamine (PalmbisLND)
PalmbisLND was prepared in two steps. In step one, palmitic acid (2 g) was reacted with 2-amino-2-methyl-propan-1,3-diol using EEDQ in ethanol for overnight. Next day the solvent was evaporated and residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate. This solution was washed with 0.1% sulfuric acid containing brine for three times and dried with magnesium sulfate. Product was purified by recrystallization in Ethylacetate and hexane mixture. Purity of Palmbis-OH was checked by TLC and NMR.
In the second step Lonidamine (LND, 138 mg, 145 mmol), 50 mg of palmbis-OH was dissolved in DMF, and to this solution EDC (135 mg), DMAP (17 mg) was added and stirred at 40 C overnight. Next day, to this solution ethyl acetate was added and washed with 0.1% sulfuric acid containing brine for three times and dried with magnesium sulfate. 137 mg of product was recovered after purification by column chromatography using hexane and ethylacetate mixture. Purity of PalmbisLND was checked by TLC and NMR.
