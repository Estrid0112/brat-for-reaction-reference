TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to the technical field of chemical medicines, and specifically to a 2-oxo-1,2-dihydrobenzo[cd]indole compound and use thereof.
BACKGROUND ART
The bromodomain (BRD) family of proteins recognizes and binds to the acetylated lysine acting as a reader of lysine acetylation state. These “epigenetic readers” bind to acetyllysine residues on the tails of histones H3 and H4, and regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. There is increasing evidence of their role in human disease, and recently a number of small-molecule nihibitors have been reported. There is increasing evidence for the roles of BRDs in disease including inflammation, neurological indications, viral infection, cancers, and autoimmune disorder.
An analysis of the human proteome has revealed that there are eight distinct BRD families, representing 61 different BRDs from 46 separate proteins, although others may still be undiscovered. The BET family of BRDs is a subset of this larger bromodomain family and is made up of four members: BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT in humans. BRD2 and BRD3 are reported to associate with histones along activity transcribed genes and may be involved in facilitating transcriptional elongation, while BRD4 appears to be involved in the recruitment of the P-TEFb complex to inducible genes, resulting in phosphorylation of RNApolymerase and increased transcription output. Chromosomal translocation of BRD3 and BRD4 to the nuclear protein in testis (NUT) locus generates BRD3-NUT or BRD4-NUT fusion protein that results in c-Myc overexpression and NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), an aggressive squamous cell malignancy unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutics. BRDT is uniquely expressed in the testes and ovary.
Recently, a number of small-molecule compounds with potent inhibitory activity against BET family proteins have been reported. The first potent BET inhibitor was the diazepine JQ1 by nuclear magnetic resonance technology, subsequently, more molecues were reported by epigenetic screening and targeted biochemistry. By these potent inhibitors, more knowledge about the relationship of BET proteins and diseases was disclosed. Rapid progress in the development of bromodomain ligands has stimulated extensive interest and has led to several BET bromodomain inhibitors reaching clinical trials for cancers and inflammations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
In the compounds of the present invention, when any variable (e.g., R1, R2, etc.) appears more than once in any component, the definition of each occurrence is independent of the other occurrence of each occurrence. Likewise, a combination of substituents and variables is allowed, as long as the combination stabilizes the compound. The lines from the substituents into the ring system indicate that the indicated bond can be attached to any of the substitutable ring atoms. If the ring system is a polycyclic, it means that the bond is only attached to any suitable carbon atom adjacent to the ring. It is to be understood that one of ordinary skill in the art can select the substituents and substitutions of the compounds of the present invention to provide compounds that are chemically stable and readily synthesizable from readily available starting materials by techniques of the art and the methods set forth below. If the substituents themselves are substituted by more than one group, it is to be understood that these groups may be on the same carbon atom or on different carbon atoms as long as the structure is stable. The term “alkyl”, “alkylene” as used herein mean to include branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having a specific number of carbon atoms. For Example, the definition of “C1-C4” in the “C1-C4” alkyl group includes a group having 1, 2, 3, 4 carbon atoms in a straight chain or branched chain. For Example, the “C1-C4” alkyl group specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, tert-butyl and isobutyl. Unless additional defined, alkyl, cycloalkyl and heterocyclyl substituents may be unsubstituted or substituted. For Example, the C1-C4 alkyl group may be substituted by one, two or three substituents selected from halogen, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, tert-butyl, trifluoromethyl, cyano, amino, phenyl diazenyl, -CONH2, -COOR, -COR7, -OR7, -NHCOR7, -NHCOOR7, -C6H5R8, morpholinyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyridyl, wherein R7 is selected from C1-C4 alkyl, phenyl; R8 is optionally substituted with a substituent selected from C1 to C4 alkyl, halogen, acetyl, methoxy, ethoxy.
The present invention includes compounds of formulas I, II, III, IV, and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include not only exemplary salts of specific compounds described herein, and also included pharmaceutically acceptable salts from compounds of formula I, II, III, IV or the free form of the compound-specific salt can be isolated using techniques known in the art. For Example, when treated with a suitable dilute aqueous solution of dilute aqueous solution, such as NaOH, K2CO3, dilute aqueous ammonia, and NaHCO3, the free form of formula I, II, III, IV was regenerated. The free form may be different from salt forms in some physical properties, such as the dissociation in polar solvents, but for the purposes of this invention, the acid salts and base salts are comparable to their respective free forms in other pharmaceuticals.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from compounds containing the basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Typically, the salt of the basic compound is prepared by ion exchange chromatography, or free base with reaction of stoichiometric or excess amount of inorganic/organic acid in a suitable solvent or combination of a plurality of solvents. Similarly, salts of acidic compounds are formed by reaction with an appropriate inorganic/organic base.
Thus, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention include conventional non-toxic salts by the reaction of a compound of the present invention with an inorganic or organic acid. For Example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids, e g. from hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, sulfamic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid; from organic acids, e g. from acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, picric acid, maleic acid, hydroxymaleic acid, phenylacetic acid, glutamic acid, benzoic acid, water 2-acetoxy-benzoic acid, fumaric acid, toluenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethane disulfonic acid, oxalic acid, isethionate, trifluoroacetic acid.
For Example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic bases, e g. from aluminum salts, ammonium salts, calcium salts, copper salts, iron salts, ferrous salts, lithium salts, magnesium salts, manganese salts, manganese salts, potassium salts, sodium salts and zinc salts. Particularly preferred are ammonium salts, calcium salts, magnesium salts, potassium salts and sodium salts; from organic bases, e g., from primary amine, secondary amine, tertiary amine and naturally substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N, N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylamino ethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, aminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucosamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydroxypropylamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucosamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, guanza, polyamine resin, procaine, purine, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine.
