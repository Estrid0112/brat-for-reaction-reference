BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Field of Invention
The present invention relates to an organic electroluminescent material and an organic electroluminescent device by using the same and, in particular, to an organic electroluminescent material containing at least one carboline group and an organic electroluminescent device by using the same.
Related Art
With the advances in electronic technology, a light weight and high efficiency flat display device has been developed. An organic electroluminescent device possibly becomes the mainstream of the next generation flat panel display device due to its advantages of self-luminosity, no restriction on viewing angle, power conservation, simple manufacturing process, low cost, high response speed, full color and so on.
In general, the organic electroluminescent device includes an anode, an organic luminescent layer and a cathode. When applying a direct current to the organic electroluminescent device, electron holes and electrons are injected into the organic luminescent layer from the anode and the cathode, respectively. Charge carriers move and then recombine in the organic luminescent layer because of the potential difference caused by an applied electric field. The excitons generated by the recombination of the electrons and the electron holes may excite the luminescent molecules in the organic luminescent layer. The excited luminescent molecules then release the energy in the form of light.
Nowadays, the organic electroluminescent device usually adopts a host-guest emitter system. The organic luminescent layer disposed therein includes a host material and a guest material. The electron holes and the electrons are mainly transmitted to the host material to perform recombination and thereby generate energy, and then the energy is transferred to the guest material to generate light. The guest material can be categorized into fluorescent material and phosphorescent material. Theoretically, the internal quantum efficiency can approach 100% by using appropriate phosphorescent materials. Therefore, the phosphorescent materials recently have become one of the most important developments in the field of organic electroluminescent materials.
In the development of blue host materials, the triplet energy level of the host materials must be higher than or equal to that of the guest materials to avoid the energy lost caused by reverse energy transfer. The energy lost can result in low luminous efficiency (i.e., low current efficiency) and short lifespan, etc. Therefore, it is necessary for the host materials to have greater triplet energy level. In order to increase the triple energy level of the blue host materials, much research has been focused on the single benzene ring with various ortho-substituted groups. In ortho-substitution with electron-transporting group (e.g., Oxadiazole or 3-(Biphenyl-4-yl)-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-4-phenyl-4H-1,2,4-triazole) and hole-transporting group (e.g., Carbazoles), a bipolar molecule is created by interrupted π-conjugated molecules due to steric hindrance.
Besides, the selection of organic electroluminescent material is not only based on the matching energy level but also the high temperature of decomposition to avoid pyrolysis caused by high temperature and also avoid the resulted decreasing of stability.
Accordingly, the present invention is provided an organic electroluminescent material containing at least one carboline group and an organic electroluminescent device by using the same which has high triplet energy level and fine thermal stability.

In the embodiment, a series of bipolar compounds are synthesized by utilizing a silicon atom as a spacer to link a hole-transporting carbazole group and an electron-transporting/hole-transporting carboline group. Alternatively, another series of bipolar compounds are synthesized by utilizing a silicon atom to link two electron-transporting/hole-transporting carboline groups.
Herein, the bipolar compounds have high triplet energy level and good thermal stability, and can be bipolar host materials of the phosphorescent organic light-emitting diode with high luminous efficiency. In other words, the host materials according to the above-mentioned embodiment comprise an electron-transporting group and a hole-transporting group in the same molecule so as to have a characteristic of bipolar carrier-transporting.
In addition, comparing with other substituted positions, for example, ortho- or meta-position, the substituent, such as carboline group or carbazole group, attached to the benzene ring at the para-position with respect to the position of attachment to the silicon atom can have a higher yield. Moreover, when three or all of four benzene rings linked to the silicon atom have steric bulkier substituents, the substituents at the para-position can have less steric hindrance and hence have higher yield.

The substituent attached to the benzene ring at the para-position can also make molecular arrangement more uniform and have advantages of good film forming ability.

Evaluation Methods for the Host Material
The host material includes the compound which is mentioned above from Example 9 to Example 14 (i.e., Chemical Formula (1) to Chemical Formula (6)). The evaluation methods for the host material is to perform the measurements of the triplet energy level (ET), the glass transition temperature (Tg), the pyrolysis temperature (Td), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) on the above-mentioned compound of examples, respectively. The triplet energy level measured at low temperature by spectrometer is the basis of selecting the host material of phosphorescent emitter. For blue light-emitting diode, FIrpic (ET=2.65 eV) is a common phosphorescent emitter and the ET of the host emitter used with FIrpic should be higher than 2.65 eV to avoid low luminous efficiency caused by reverse energy transfer. The glass transition temperature and the pyrolysis temperature respectively measured by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) are considered to be the basis of the stability for the fabrication and performance of unit. HOMO and LUMO are acquired receptively from oxidation potential and reduction potential of the material by using cyclic voltammetry, which can facilitate in searching of an electric charge injection material with small difference energy gap and enhance the efficiency of the unit. The properties of the compounds of Chemical Formula (1) to Chemical Formula (6) are shown in Table 1.

According to Table 1, the pyrolysis temperatures of the compound of Chemical Formula (1) to Chemical Formula (6) are all higher than 300° C. It is because that their structures contain multiple benzene rings which are rigid structures, so that the pyrolysis caused by the heat is not easily occurred during the heating process. Based on the reason mentioned above, their derivatives have fine thermal stability and high triplet energy level and are quite beneficial to be the host material in the organic luminescent layer of the organic light emitting diode.

The organic electroluminescent devices shown in Table 2 not only have low driving voltages but also have the fine current efficiency, power efficiency and external quantum efficiency. Accordingly, the host materials of the present invention have high transmission rate of electrons and electron holes, and are not necessarily to be operated under high driving voltage. Also, the external quantum efficiencies of the host materials shown in Table 2 are high as well. Consequently, the host materials of the present invention have higher triplet energy level, which is beneficial to reduce reverse energy transfer and to increase the luminous efficiency of organic electroluminescent device.
In summary, in the organic electroluminescent material and the organic electroluminescent device according to the present invention, a series of bipolar compounds are synthesized by utilizing a silicon atom as a spacer to link a hole-transporting carbazole group and an electron-transporting/hole-transporting carboline group. Alternatively, another series of bipolar compounds are synthesized by utilizing a silicon atom as a spacer to link two electron-transporting/hole-transporting carboline groups. The bipolar compounds of the present invention having high triplet energy level and good thermal stability can be organic electroluminescent materials with high luminous efficiency.
