CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0094145, filed on Jul. 25, 2016, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, and entitled: “Heterocyclic Compound and Organic Light-Emitting Device Including the Same,” is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
Embodiments relate to a heterocyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that have relatively wide viewing angles, relatively high contrast ratios, relatively short response times, and increased luminance, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics. Organic light-emitting devices may produce full-color images.
Organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode on a substrate. Organic light-emitting devices may include a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode sequentially on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region. Electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, may recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. The excitons may transition from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.

In an implementation, the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be one of the following Compounds 1 to 77.
The heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may have a heterocyclic structure having a phosphine oxide substituent, and thus may be advantageous in terms of luminous efficiency and energy transfer.
For example, in the heterocyclic compound, at least two substituents represented by Formula 2 may be substituted at a triaryl phosphine oxide, and thus the heterocyclic compound may have improved hole mobility as compared with a case in which the heterocyclic compound has only one substituent. Performance of a device may be varied by adjusting the position of the substituents to control the polarity of molecules.
In an implementation, in the heterocyclic compound, the substituent represented by Formula 2 may be bound to the phosphine oxide group via at least one π electron-depleted nitrogen-containing C2-C60 heterocyclic group (e.g., a pyridine group), thus facilitating control of polarity of the heterocyclic compound molecule and enabling suitable control of hole transportability or electron transportability in a device. Consequently, the heterocyclic compound may help improve device characteristics.
For example, the substituent represented by Formula 2 may help prevent an electron conjugation effect, as compared with a case having “O” instead of Y, thus increasing an energy gap of a material. Further, in the heterocyclic compound, when a “N” position in the π electron-depleted nitrogen-containing C2-C60 heterocyclic group bound to the phosphine oxide group is at an ortho-, meta-, or para-position with respect to a binding position to the phosphine oxide, the polarity of a molecule may increase in general, or intermolecular force may increase, resulting in an increase in electron transportability of a material. Consequently, the heterocyclic compound may help improve device characteristics.
In an implementation, in the heterocyclic compound, when the substituent represented by Formula 2 bound to the π electron-depleted nitrogen-containing C2-C60 heterocyclic group is at a meta- or para-position with respect to a binding position to the phosphine oxide, an energy level of a material may be easily controlled by adjusting electron donating characteristics, and device characteristics may improve by appropriately controlling electron and hole transportability of the material.
At least one heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be included between a pair of electrodes in an organic light-emitting device. In an implementation, the heterocyclic compound may be included in an emission layer and/or an electron transport region.

In an implementation, the organic layer may include Compounds 1 and 2 as the heterocyclic compounds. In this regard, Compounds 1 and 2 may be present in the same layer (e.g., Compounds 1 and 2 may be both present in an emission layer), or in different layers (e.g., Compound 1 may be present in an emission layer and Compound 2 may be present in a hole transport layer).
The organic layer may include i) a hole transport region between the first electrode (anode) and the emission layer that includes at least one selected from a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, a buffer layer, and an electron blocking layer, and ii) an electron transport region between the emission layer and the second electrode (cathode) that includes at least one selected from a hole blocking layer, an electron transport layer, and an electron injection layer. At least one selected from the hole transport region and the emission layer may include at least one heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1. In an implementation, the organic light-emitting device may include an emission layer, and the emission layer may include at least one heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1. The emission layer may include a host and a dopant, and at least one selected from the host and the dopant may include at least one heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1. In an implementation, the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 included in the emission layer may serve as a host, and in this case, the emission layer may further include a dopant described herein. In an implementation, the heterocyclic compound represented by Formula 1 included in the emission layer may serve as a dopant, and in this case, the emission layer may further include a host described herein.
The organic light-emitting device may further include at least one selected from a first capping layer disposed in a path of light extracted or emitted from the emission layer, allowing the light to pass through to the outside after passing the first electrode; and a second capping layer disposed in a path of light extracted or emitted from the emission layer, allowing the light to pass through to the outside after passing the second electrode, wherein at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include at least one heterocyclic compound.
