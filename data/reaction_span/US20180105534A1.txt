TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention falls within the field of luminescent material technology and it specifically relates to an organic electroluminescent compound which could be used as blue dopant material and an organic electroluminescent device using the organic electroluminescent compound.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
So far, most of flat panel displays are liquid crystal displays (LCD), however, people around the world have been trying with great efforts to develop a new flat panel display different from LCD, which is more economical and has an outstanding performance. Recently, organic electroluminescent devices, as the next generation of flat panel displays, have attracted much attention. Compared with LCDs, organic electroluminescent devices have many advantages, such as self-luminescence, wide angle of view, low driving voltage, fast response speed, potential of achieving flexible display lamps, etc. Since they were invented in 1980s, organic electroluminescent devices have already been applied in industrial practice, such as manufacturing of cameras, computers, mobile phones, TV displays, etc. Although the technology of organic electroluminescent device has been greatly developed over the years due to continuous investments and unremitting efforts from all over the field, it is still restricted by many problems, such as short life expectancy, low efficiency, etc.
An organic electroluminescent device includes a substrate, an anode, a hole injection layer for accepting holes from the anode, a hole transport layer for transporting holes, an emission layer where holes and electrons are combined to emit lights, an electron blocking layer for preventing electrons entering the hole transport layer from the emission layer, an hole blocking layer for preventing holes entering the electron transport layer from the emission layer, an electron injection layer for accepting electrons from cathode.
The driving mechanism of the organic electroluminescent device is described as follows: when voltage is applied between the anode and the cathode, holes injected from the anode travel via the hole injection layer and the hole transport layer into the emission layer. Meanwhile, electrons injected from the cathode travel via the electron injection layer and electron transport layer into the emission layer. The current carriers and electrons are recombined to generate excitons within the emission layer. Under the current status, the excitons change into the ground state, and accordingly, the fluorescent molecules in the emission layer emit lights to form images. Here, when excitons return to the ground state through a singlet excited state, the lights emitted are called fluorescence; when excitons return to the ground state through a triplet excited state, the lights emitted are called phosphorescence. The probability for excitons to transfer through a singlet excited state to the ground state is 25%, while the probability through a triplet excited state to the ground state is 75%. Therefore, for organic electroluminescent devices emitting fluorescence, the luminous efficiency is limited; however, for organic electroluminescent devices emitting phosphorescence, emissions can be caused by 75% of triplet excitons and 25% of singlet excitons, rendering the internal quantum efficiency up to 100% in theory. The phosphorescent emission layer includes main body material and dopant material. The dopant material accepts energy from the main body material to emit lights. The dopant material may include Iridium compounds, which yet may cause problems such as low luminous efficiency of blue lights and short life expectancy. It is of great urgency, with the enlargement of displays' sizes, to invent a new blue dopant material for solving the above problems.

Manufacturing of Organic Electroluminescent Device
Device Example 1
ITO was used as an anode substrate material of reflecting layer and the surface of the ITO anode was treated with N2 plasma or UV-Ozone. On top of the anode, a 10 nm-thick HAT-CN was vapor deposited to form the hole injection layer (HIL) and a 120 nm-thick NPD was vapor deposited to form the hole transport layer (HTL). On top of the hole transport layer as described above, an emission layer (EML) was formed by vapor deposition of a 25 nm-thick 9,10-di(2-naphthyl) anthraces (ADN) which could produce blue EML mixed with 5 wt % Compound 2 in the present invention.
On top of the emission layer, an electron transport layer (ETL) was formed by vapor deposition of a 35 nm-thick mixture of anthracene derivatives (50 wt %) and Liq (50 wt %); and an electron injection layer (EIL) was formed thereon, by a 2 nm-thick Liq. Finally, a cathode was formed, by vapor deposition of a 15 nm-thick mixture of Magnesium (90 wt %) and Argentine (10 wt %), and covering and protecting layer (CPL) was formed thereon, to a thickness of 65 nm, by yap or depositing N4,N4'-bis[4-[bis(3-methylphenyl)amino]phenyl]-N4,N4'-diphenyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-biamine (DNTPD). In addition, a water absorbent material containing UV hardening adhesive was applied to the surface of the cathode to protect the organic electroluminescent device from being affected by the oxygen and water in the atmosphere.
The compound mentioned in this example is of the following structural formula:

As shown in the above table, compared with those prepared as described for Comparative Device Example 1, organic electroluminescent devices prepared as described for Device Examples 1-10 using Compounds in the present invention, present higher efficiency and an outstanding voltage performance.
Further, the results of CIE chromaticity coordinates (CIE x, y) have showed that, compared with those prepared as described for Comparative Device Example 1, the CIE y values of organic electroluminescent devices prepared as described for Device Examples 1-10 are lower, thus it can be inferred as having deep blue performance, especially for the devices prepared as described for Device Examples 2, 3, 4, 5 and 9, which have more an obvious deep blue performance.
Therefore, organic electroluminescent devices using compounds in the present invention as the dopant are advantageous in terms of the device efficiency, voltage and deep blue performance.
