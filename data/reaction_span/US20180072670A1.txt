Background Art
Recently, in flavors for food and drink and for cosmetics, there is an increasing need for flavors having a new type of unprecedented odor/taste with diversification of consumers' preferences, and development of unique flavor materials having mild and fresh flavor quality and excellent in sustainability is desired. Given the situation, studies for preparing flavor compositions that may feel as natural as possible are being made by combining flavor materials adequately or with changing the compounding ratio thereof, but could not be said to be sufficient. Consequently, searches for various organic compounds as new flavor materials are being made.
Flavor compounds are compounds that stimulate a sense of smell, and it is said that tens of thousands of kinds of such compounds are known. On the other hand, it is considered that the flavor of food is a sense of olfactory stimulus and taste stimulus integrated in the brain. Specifically, olfactory stimulus is combined with a compound that stimulates a sense of taste (salt, sugar, sodium glutamate, etc.) to constitute an entire flavor of food. Recently, among aroma compounds, those that stimulate both a sense of taste and a sense of smell are searched for actively, and are used for improving a total flavor of food and drink.
As a compound that stimulates both a sense of smell and a sense of taste, for example, 4-hydroxy-2(5)-ethyl-5(2)-methyl-3(2H)-furanone has been found to have an effect of enhancing saltiness when added to soy sauce (Patent Document 1). In addition, 1,3,5-undecatriene has been found to have an additional effect of enhancing a carbonic taste similar to salt stimulation when added to carbonated drink (Patent Document 2). In general, many flavor compounds produce a bitter taste relative to a sense of taste. Above all, menthol that is a typical flavor compound is known to have a cooling taste as an olfactory stimulus effect, but apart from the olfactory stimulus effect, the compound is also known to produce a cooling feel on the skin or on the mouth as a pain sensation effect, thereby having a bitter taste as a taste stimulus effect.
Regarding umami (delicious taste) as a basic taste, compounds that stimulate both a sense of smell and a sense of taste have been found among aroma compounds, and by applying these compounds as food aromas, the functionality of food and drink is expanded to provide a new taste that consumers desire. For example, 2-alkylpyridines are disclosed to have umami (Patent Document 3). In addition, aromatic ketone compounds having a pyridine ring-containing substituent (Patent Document 4) and aromatic amide compounds (PATENT DOCUMENT 5) are also disclosed as umami substances.
In addition, 2-(2-benzyloxyethyl)pyridine that is a kind of 2-(phenylalkyloxyalkyl)pyridines is reported as a product of a nitrile compound and acetylene in pyridine ring synthesis reaction studies (Non-Patent Document 1) and in coupling reaction studies utilizing an organic metal (Non-Patent Document 2), and use thereof as an umami enhancer is disclosed (PATENT DOCUMENT 6).

In addition, by imparting a flavor to a food or drink product, and by adding the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof to a flavor composition as an active ingredient therein followed by adding the flavor composition to the food or drink product, umami of the food or drink product can be enhanced.
The flavor composition of the present invention may contain the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof generally in a concentration of 0.1 ppm to 2% based on the mass of the flavor composition, preferably 1 ppm to 0.5%, more preferably 10 ppm to 0.1%.
Further, in the case where the flavor composition is used for imparting a flavor to food and drink or cosmetics, the composition is added thereto in an amount of approximately 0.01% to 1% so that the addition concentration of the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof in the food or drink product or in the cosmetic product could be within a range of 0.1 ppb to 200 ppm by mass, preferably 1 ppb to 20 ppm, more preferably 10 ppb to 2 ppm.

In the case where the flavor composition is used for enhancing umami, saltiness, sweetness and milk richness of food and drink, the composition may be added in an amount of approximately 0.005% to 1% so that the addition concentration of the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof to the food or drink product could be, based on the mass of the food or drink product, within a range of 0.1 ppb to 40 ppm, preferably 1 ppb to 10 ppm, more preferably 5 ppb to 2 ppm. As a result, the compound represented by the formula (1) can act on the food or drink product as an active ingredient to thereby enhance the umami, saltiness, sweetness or milk richness of the food or drink product.
When the addition concentration of the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof to food and drink or to cosmetics is less than 0.1 ppm, the flavor imparting effect thereof to food and drink or to cosmetics and the umami enhancing effect thereof to food and drink would be poor, but when the addition concentration of the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof to food and drink or to cosmetics is more than 200 ppm, the peculiar flavor of the compound itself would be often unfavorably too strong in food and drink or cosmetics. In addition, there may be an unfavorable probability that the taste balance of food and drink would be lost.

Without emulsified, the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof is, by itself, effective and useful as a flavor modulator, an umami imparting agent, an umami enhancer, a sweetness enhancer, a saltiness enhancer and a milk richness enhancer. By processing the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof into an emulsified composition or a powdery composition, the dispersibility thereof in water can be improved, and the resultant composition can be readily blended with a food or drink product or with a cosmetic product, and in addition, can change the timing thereof for flavor expression. For example, in the case where the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof is incorporated in a ramen soup for umami enhancement, and when it is added to an oil-soluble flavor, the oil-soluble flavor will float as oil so that the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof contained in oil would act in the mouth. On the other hand, when added in the form of an emulsified composition thereof, fine particles of the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof could uniformly act in the mouth to thereby realize further strengthened and uniform umami enhancement.
An emulsified composition containing the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof is not specifically limited, and any one prepared by emulsifying the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof in a known method may be employed here. To the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof, or to a flavor composition containing it, water that is a component (B) for use in the present invention, one or more selected from sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols that is a component (C), and an emulsifier (D) are incorporated, and for example, the resultant composition is mixed, stirred and emulsified using a homo-mixer, a colloid mill, a high-pressure homogenizer or the like to give an emulsified composition.
In emulsifying the above, for example, the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof is incorporated in an oily phase part, and the component (B) water, and one or more selected from sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols as the component (C) are incorporated in an aqueous phase, and the two may be mixed to prepare an oil-in-water emulsion.
Water that is the component (B) for use in the present invention constitutes the above-mentioned aqueous phase along with the component (C) of sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols, and the water content in the aqueous phase is generally 50% or less, and is especially preferably in a hydrous state where the content is within a range of about 0 to 25%. When the water content is more than 50%, the composition will lose antiseptic performance.
Sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols that are the component (C) in the present invention are incorporated for stabilizing emulsion. Examples of sugars include glucose, fructose, sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, maltotriose, rhamnose, lactose, maltose, ribose, xylose, arabinose, starch syrup, etc.; examples of monoalcohols include ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, etc.; examples of polyalcohols include glycerin, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, sorbitol, maltitol, starch decomposed reduced product, etc.; and a mixture of two or more of these is also employable.
The amount of the aqueous phase to be used in the emulsified composition is generally within a range of about 1 part by weight to about 10 parts by weight relative to one part by weight of the oily phase part, and especially preferably within a range of about 1.5 parts by weight to about 5 parts by weight. As needed, an organic acid such as lactic acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid or the like may be added to the aqueous phase for the purpose of improving storability.
2-(3-Benzyloxypropyl)pyridine and the above-mentioned various flavors can dissolve in the component (C) of sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols in a low concentration, and therefore can be incorporated in the aqueous phase part.
An emulsifier (or a stabilizer as the case may be) of the component (D) for use in the present invention is not specifically limited, and various emulsifiers heretofore used in food and drink and others are usable, and examples thereof include fatty acid monoglyceride, fatty acid diglyceride, fatty acid triglyceride, propylene glycol fatty acid ester, sucrose fatty acid ester, polyglycerin fatty acid ester, (oxidation-processed) lecithin, processed starch, sorbitan fatty acid ester, quillai extract, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, guar gum, karaya gum, xanthane gum, pectine, argic acid and salts thereof, carrageenan, gelatin, casein, etc.
One or more emulsifiers (or stabilizer) are incorporated and, for example, using a homomixer, a colloid mill, a high-pressure homogenizer or the like, the mixture is emulsified to be a form of an emulsified flavor preparation. The amount of the emulsifier (or stabilizer) to be used varies depending on the type of the emulsifier (or stabilizer), but for example, based on the mass of the emulsified flavor preparation, the amount may be within a range of 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably within a range of 5 to 20% by weight.
Among these emulsifiers, hydrophilic surfactants having HLB of 8 or more are preferred, and in the case, the emulsifier is mixed in the aqueous phase part. Specifically, there are mentioned polyglycerin fatty acid ester, sorbitan fatty acid ester, sucrose fatty acid ester, glycerin fatty acid ester, etc. Examples of polyglycerin fatty acid esters include esters of a polyglycerin having a mean polymerization degree of 3 or more and a fatty acid having 8 or more carbon atoms, for example, decaglycerin monooleate, decaglycerin monostearate, decaglycerin monopalmitate, decaglycerin monomyristate and the like having HLB of about 8 or more, preferably falling within a range of about 8 to about 14. When polyglycerin fatty acid esters having HLB of lower than 8 are used, in general, it is difficult to prepare emulsified particles having a uniform and small particle size. In addition, the emulsion is unstable, and when it is added to drink, there may be a strong tendency toward a phenomenon of separation such as precipitation, oil separation, etc.
The content of the polyglycerin fatty acid ester to be contained is generally within a range of about 0.05 parts by weight to about 0.5 parts by weight relative to 1 part by weight of the oily phase part, preferably within a range of about 0.15 parts by weight to about 0.3 parts by weight.
One embodiment of a method for preparation of the emulsified composition of the present invention is exemplified below. First, the raw materials for use for the above-mentioned oily phase part are mixed to prepare one part by mass of an oily phase part. Apart from this, about 2 to about 50 parts by weight (water content, about 0.5 to about 10% by weight) of a solution (aqueous phase) is prepared by mixing and dissolving (B) water, (C) one or more selected from sugars, monoalcohols or polyalcohols, and (D) an emulsifier, and the oily phase part and the aqueous phase part are mixed and emulsified using a homomixer, a colloid mill, a high-pressure homogenizer or the like, thereby producing an extremely fine and stable emulsion of fine particles having a particle size of about 0.2 to about 2 μm.
The compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof, or a flavor composition containing it may be contained in the emulsified composition, generally in an amount of, based on the mass of the emulsified composition, 0.1 ppm to 2%, preferably 1 ppm to 0.5%, more preferably 10 ppm to 0.1%.
Further, the emulsified composition may be dried to prepare a powdery composition. For example, an excipient of sugars such as table sugar, lactose, glucose, trehalose, cellobiose, starch syrup, reduced sugar syrup, etc.; sugar alcohols; various starch decomposed products such as dextrin, etc., as well as starch derivatives, starch, gelatin, natural gums such as gum arabic and the like is adequately added to the composition, and then dried according to an adequate drying method of spray drying, vacuum drying, freeze drying or the like to give a form of a powdery composition. The amount of the excipient to be added may be adequately selected depending on the characteristics desired for the powdery composition.
By adding the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof of the present invention by itself, or by adding the flavor composition containing the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof as an active ingredient to food or drink products, herbal, green, earthy, almond, nutty or rummy flavor of natural impression of food and drink can be enhanced, and additionally, umami, sweetness, saltiness or milk richness thereof can also be enhanced. Examples of the food or drink products include carbonated drinks such as cola drink, fruit juice-added carbonated drink, milk-added carbonated drink, etc.; soft drinks such as fruit juice drink, vegetable drink, isotonic drink, honey drink, soy milk, vitamin supplement drink, mineral supplement drink, nutrition supplement drink, energy drink, lactobacillus drink, milk drink, etc.; taste-oriented drinks such as green tea, black tea, oolong tea, herb tea, milk tea, coffee, etc.; alcohol drinks such as shochu mixed with soda water, cocktail drink, low-malt beer, fruit liquor, medicinal liquor, etc.; dairy products such as butter, cheese, milk, yoghurt, etc.; desserts such as ice cream, lacto-ice, sherbet, yoghurt, pudding, jelly, dairy dessert, etc., and mixes for producing them; confectionery such as caramel, candy, tablet candy, cracker, biscuit, cookie, pie, chocolate, snack, etc., and mixes such as cake mix and the like for producing them; general foods such as bread, soup, various ready-to-serve foods, etc.; oral compositions such as tooth paste, etc.
By adding 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine that is a preferred embodiment of the present invention to food and drink by itself or as a flavor composition containing 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine as an active ingredient, herbal, green or nutty flavor of natural impression of food and drink can be enhanced, or umami can be imparted thereto, or umami, sweetness, saltiness or milk richness thereof can be enhanced. Regarding the specific examples of the food or drink products in the case, the same as above shall also apply thereto.
Specific examples of cosmetics whose herbal, earthy, almond, nutty or rummy flavor can be enhanced by adding thereto the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof of the present invention by itself or in the form of a flavor composition containing the compound represented by the formula (1) or a salt thereof as an active ingredient include perfume; haircare products such as shampoo, hair conditioner, hair cream, pomade, etc.; makeup cosmetics such as face powder, lip rouge, etc.; health and hygiene detergents such as face soap, body soap, laundry soap, laundry detergent, sanitizing detergent, deodorant detergent, etc.; health and hygiene goods such as tooth paste, tissue paper, toilet paper, etc.; aroma products such as in-room aroma, car cologne, etc.
The same as above shall also apply to specific examples of cosmetics whose herbal, green or nutty flavor of natural impression can be enhanced by adding thereto, 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine that is one preferred embodiment of the present invention, by itself or in the form of a flavor composition containing 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine as an active ingredient.

100 g of the milk-like compounded flavor composition of Table 27 (referenced product 204: 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine concentration 1.0 mass %, or reference product 205: not using 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine) as an oily phase, and a solution of 312.5 g of glycerin, and 22.5 g of decaglycerin monopalmitake dissolved in 65 g of ion-exchanged water as an aqueous phase were prepared. The two were mixed by stirring with a TK-homogenizer (manufactured by Primix Corporation) at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes for emulsification. Thus, a milk-like emulsified flavor composition in the form of an O/W emulsion was prepared, whose absorbance at a wavelength 680 nm in 1/2000 dilution with ion-exchanged water was 0.2 Abs (invention product 204: 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine concentration 0.2% by mass, comparative product 202: not using 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine).
Example 214: Addition of Milk-Like Emulsified Flavor Composition to Lacto-Ice
According to the formulation of the following Table 28, lacto-ice was prepared, and 0.01% of the milk-like compounded flavor composition of the invention product 204 or the comparative product 202 was added thereto (2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine concentration in the lacto-ice using the invention product 204, 0.2 ppm). For preparing lacto-ice, all the materials were dissolved by heating and emulsified with a homogenizer at 150 kg/cm2, and then aged overnight at 10° C. This was frozen with a freezer, and then hardened up at −40° C. for 1 hour to give lacto-ice.

Well-trained 5 panelists tasted the lacto-ice added with the milk-like emulsified flavor composition of the comparative product 202 or the invention product 204, and the non-added lacto-ice for organoleptic evaluation. As a result, all the five panelists first concluded that the lacto-ice added with the comparative product 202 provided better milk-like flavor than the lacto-ice not added with the flavor. Further, all the five panelists concluded that the lacto-ice added with the invention product 204 provided better milk-like flavor than the lacto-ice added with the comparative product 202 and that, regarding taste, the former provided enhanced umami, sweetness and milk richness and was extremely delicious and good.
Example 215: Milk-Like Powdery Flavor Composition
As an aqueous phase, 70 g of gum arabic and 20 g of trehalose were dissolved in 150 g of water, and sterilized by heating at 85 to 90° C. for 15 minutes, and then cooled down to 40° C. As an oily phase, 10 g of the reference product 204 was added thereto and mixed, and then emulsified with a TK-homogenizer to produce an O/W emulsified composition. The emulsified composition was spray-dried, using a mobile minor spray drier by Niro, at an inlet temperature of 140° C. and an outlet temperature of 75° C. to produce 95 g of a milk-like powdery flavor composition (invention product 205: 2-(3-benzyloxypropyl)pyridine concentration 0.1% by mass).
Example 216: Addition to Aqueous Solution of Skim Milk
Skim milk, and a mixture of 99 parts by mass of skim milk and 1 part by mass of the invention product 205 were prepared by thorough mixing. 10 parts by mass of each was mixed with 90 parts by mass of water to prepare a mixture solution (aqueous solution of skim milk). Well-trained 5 panelists tasted these for organoleptic evaluation. As a result, all the five panelists concluded that the aqueous solution of skim milk added with the invention product 205 was better than the non-added aqueous solution of skim milk in that the former provided stronger milky flavor, stronger umami and sweetness, and stronger milk richness, namely, the former had an extremely good milky taste.
