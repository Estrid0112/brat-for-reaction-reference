FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The disclosure provides compounds as well as their compositions and methods of use. The compounds modulate hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) activity and are useful in the treatment of various diseases including cancer.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1) originally cloned from hematopoietic progenitor cells is a member of MAP kinase kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) family, which includes MAP4K1/HPK1, MAP4K2/GCK, MAP4K3/GLK, MAP4K4/HGK, MAP4K5/KHS, and MAP4K6/MINK (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64). HPK1 is of particular interest because it is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells such as T cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and mast cells (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64; Kiefer, F., et al., EMBO J, 1996. 15(24): p. 7013-25). HPK1 kinase activity has been shown to be induced upon activation of T cell receptors (TCR) (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408), B cell receptors (BCR) (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408), transforming growth factor receptor (TGF-βR) (Wang, W., et al., J Biol Chem, 1997. 272(36): p. 22771-5; Zhou, G., et al., J Biol Chem, 1999. 274(19): p. 13133-8), or Gs-coupled PGE2 receptors (EP2 and EP4) (Ikegami, R., et al., J Immunol, 2001. 166(7): p. 4689-96). As such, HPK1 regulates diverse functions of various immune cells.
HPK1 is important in regulating the functions of various immune cells and it has been implicated in autoimmune diseases and anti-tumor immunity (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91; Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48). HPK1 knockout mice were more susceptible to the induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91). In human, HPK1 was downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of psoriatic arthritis patients or T cells of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients (Batliwalla, F. M., et al., Mol Med, 2005. 11(1-12): p. 21-9). Those observations suggested that attenuation of HPK1 activity may contribute to autoimmunity in patients. Furthermore, HPK1 may also control anti-tumor immunity via T cell-dependent mechanisms. In the PGE2-producing Lewis lung carcinoma tumor model, the tumors developed more slowly in HPK1 knockout mice as compared to wild-type mice (see US 2007/0087988). In addition, it was shown that adoptive transfer of HPK1 deficient T cells was more effective in controlling tumor growth and metastasis than wild-type T cells (Alzabin, S., et al., Cancer Immunol Immunother, 2010. 59(3): p. 419-29). Similarly, BMDCs from HPK1 knockout mice were more efficient to mount a T cell response to eradicate Lewis lung carcinoma as compared to wild-type BMDCs (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). These data, in conjunction with the restricted expression of HPK1 in hematopoietic cells and lack of effect on the normal development of immune cells, suggest that HPK1 may be an excellent drug target for enhancing antitumor immunity. Accordingly, there is a need for new compounds that modulate HPK1 activity.

The term “n-membered,” where n is an integer, typically describes the number of ring-forming atoms in a moiety where the number of ring-forming atoms is n. For example, piperidinyl is an example of a 6-membered heterocycloalkyl ring, pyrazolyl is an example of a 5-membered heteroaryl ring, pyridyl is an example of a 6-membered heteroaryl ring and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalene is an example of a 10-membered cycloalkyl group.
At various places in the present specification, variables defining divalent linking groups may be described. It is specifically intended that each linking substituent include both the forward and backward forms of the linking substituent. For example, -NR(CR'R″)n- includes both -NR(CR'R″)n- and -(CR'R″)nNR- and is intended to disclose each of the forms individually. Where the structure requires a linking group, the Markush variables listed for that group are understood to be linking groups. For example, if the structure requires a linking group and the Markush group definition for that variable lists “alkyl” or “aryl” then it is understood that the “alkyl” or “aryl” represents a linking alkylene group or arylene group, respectively.
The term “substituted” means that an atom or group of atoms formally replaces hydrogen as a “substituent” attached to another group. The term “substituted”, unless otherwise indicated, refers to any level of substitution, e.g., mono-, di-, tri-, tetra- or penta-substitution, where such substitution is permitted. The substituents are independently selected, and substitution may be at any chemically accessible position. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom is limited by valency. It is to be understood that substitution at a given atom results in a chemically stable molecule. The phrase “optionally substituted” means unsubstituted or substituted. The term “substituted” means that a hydrogen atom is removed and replaced by a substituent. A single divalent substituent, e.g., oxo, can replace two hydrogen atoms.

Depending on the particular reaction step, suitable solvents for a particular reaction step can be selected by the skilled artisan.
Preparation of compounds of the invention can involve the protection and deprotection of various chemical groups. The need for protection and deprotection, and the selection of appropriate protecting groups, can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. The chemistry of protecting groups is described, e.g., in Kocienski, Protecting Groups, (Thieme, 2007); Robertson, Protecting Group Chemistry, (Oxford University Press, 2000); Smith et al., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 6th Ed. (Wiley, 2007); Peturssion et al., “Protecting Groups in Carbohydrate Chemistry,” J. Chem. Educ., 1997, 74(11), 1297; and Wuts et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 4th Ed., (Wiley, 2006).
Reactions can be monitored according to any suitable method known in the art. For example, product formation can be monitored by spectroscopic means, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (e.g., 1H or 13C), infrared spectroscopy, spectrophotometry (e.g., UV-visible), mass spectrometry or by chromatographic methods such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or thin layer chromatography (TLC).
The Schemes below provide general guidance in connection with preparing the compounds of the invention. One skilled in the art would understand that the preparations shown in the Schemes can be modified or optimized using general knowledge of organic chemistry to prepare various compounds of the invention.
Compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared, e.g., using a process as illustrated in the schemes below. Compounds of Formula (I) with various substitutions at position R3 such as those described herein can be prepared, using a process as illustrated in Scheme 1. Iodination of compounds of Formula 1-1 (e.g., using iodine or NIS) affords compounds of Formula 1-2. The NH group is protected with a suitable protecting group (e.g., SEM or Boc) to form compounds of Formula 1-3. The iodo substituent in compounds of Formula 1-3 can be converted into R1 via a number of different cross-coupling reactions, including Suzuki (e.g., in the presence of a palladium catalyst, such as Xphos Pd G2, and a base, such as potassium phosphate), Sonogashira, Negishi, Stille (e.g., in the presence of a palladium(0) catalyst, such as tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)), Buchwald-Hartwig amination, Cu-catalyzed amination (e.g., in the presence of Cu catalyst and a ligand, such as CuI and phenanthroline, and a base, such as cesium carbonate or potassium carbonate) and others, to give compounds of Formula 1-4. The compounds of Formula 1-4 are then converted into compounds of Formula 1-5 under Pd-catalyzed hydroxylation conditions, such as using Pd catalyst (e.g., tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (0)), ligand (e.g., di-tert-butyl(2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl-2-yl)phosphine) and base (e.g., potassium hydroxide). The compounds of Formula 1-5 can be converted into compounds of Formula 1-6 via a number of different arylation (e.g., Cu-catalyzed arylation, such as using CuI and 4,7-dimethoxy-1,10-phenanthroline, or SNAr reaction, such as using aryl halide and base), alkylation (e.g., nucleophilic substitution, such as using alkyl halide and base) and other reactions. Finally, deprotection of the protecting group, e.g. under acidic conditions, such as treatment with HCl or TFA, results in the formation of the desired compounds of Formula (I).
Alternatively, for the exploration of the substitution at position R1, compounds of Formula (I) can be prepared, using a process as illustrated in Scheme 2. NH protection of compounds of Formula 1-1 with a suitable protecting group (e.g. SEM or Boc) affords compounds of Formula 2-2. The compounds of Formula 2-2 are then converted into compounds of Formula 2-3 under Pd-catalyzed hydroxylation conditions. The compounds of Formula 2-3 can be converted into compounds of Formula 2-4 via a number of different arylation (e.g., Cu-catalyzed arylation or SNAr reaction), alkylation (e.g., nucleophilic substitution) and other reactions. Deprotection of the compounds of Formula 2-4, followed by iodination of compounds of Formula 2-5 (e.g., using iodine or NIS), can give compounds of Formula 2-6. Then, the NH group in the compounds of Formula 2-6 is protected with a suitable protecting group (e.g., SEM or Boc) to form compounds of Formula 2-7. The iodo substituent in the compounds of Formula 2-7 can be converted into R1 via a number of different cross-coupling reactions, including Stille (ACS Catalysis 2015, 5, 3040-3053) Suzuki (Tetrahedron 2002, 58, 9633-9695), Sonogashira (Chem. Soc. Rev. 2011, 40, 5084-5121), Negishi (ACS Catalysis 2016, 6, 1540-1552), Buchwald-Hartwig amination (Chem. Sci. 2011, 2, 27-50), Cu-catalyzed amination (Org. React. 2014, 85, 1-688) and others, to give compounds of Formula 1-6. Finally, deprotection of the protecting group under acidic conditions (e.g., treatment with HCl or TFA) results in the formation of the desired compounds of Formula (I).
Compounds of Formula (Ia) (compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is NRcC(O)Rb) can be prepared, using a process as illustrated in Scheme 3. Compounds of Formula 2-7 react with an amine, e.g. 4-methoxybenzylamine, under Buchwald-Hartwig amination conditions (e.g. Pd-catalyst, such as Ruphos Pd G2, and a base, such as cesium carbonate) to form compounds of Formula 3-2. Deprotection of the protecting groups (e.g., under acidic conditions, such as treatment with TFA) results in the formation of compounds of Formula 3-3. The NH group of the pyrazole ring of the compounds of Formula 3-3 is protected with a suitable protecting group (e.g., SEM or Boc) to form compounds of Formula 3-4. Then, the compounds of Formula 3-4 can react with different acid chlorides in a presence of base, such as triethylamine or DIPEA, to form compounds of Formula 3-5. Finally, deprotection of the protecting group, e.g. under acidic conditions, such as treatment with HCl or TFA, results in the formation of the desired compounds of Formula (Ia). Alternatively, alkylation or arylation of the compounds of Formula 3-5, followed by deprotection, can afford amides wherein Rc is other than hydrogen.
Compounds of Formula (Ib) (compounds of Formula I wherein R1 is C(O)NRcRd) can be prepared, using a process as illustrated in Scheme 4. Compounds of Formula 2-7 are converted into compounds of Formula 4-2 under Pd-catalyzed carbonylation conditions, such as using Pd catalyst (e.g., Pd(dppf)Cl2*DCM) and base (e.g., triethylamine) under carbon monoxide atmosphere. Hydrolysis of the ester group under basic conditions, such as LiOH or NaOH, forms the compounds of Formula 4-3. Then, the compounds of the Formula 4-3 can be coupled with different amines HNRcRd under amide coupling conditions (e.g., using HBTU, HATU or EDC) to give compounds of Formula 4-4. Finally, deprotection of the protecting group, e.g. under acidic conditions, such as treatment with HCl or TFA, results in the formation of the desired compounds of Formula (Ib).
HPK1 Kinase
Extensive studies have established that HPK1 is a negative regulator of T cell and B cell activation (Hu, M. C., et al., Genes Dev, 1996. 10(18): p. 2251-64; Kiefer, F., et al., EMBO J, 1996. 15(24): p. 7013-25). HPK1-deficient mouse T cells showed dramatically increased activation of TCR proximal signaling, enhanced IL-2 production, and hyper-proliferation in vitro upon anti-CD3 stimulation (Shui, J. W., et al., Nat Immunol, 2007. 8(1): p. 84-91). Similar to T cells, HPK1 knockout B cells produced much higher levels of IgM and IgG isoforms after KLH immunization and displayed hyper-proliferation potentially as a result of enhanced BCR signaling. Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48. Mechanistically, during TCR or BCR signaling, HPK1 is activated by LCK/ZAP70 (T cells) or SYK/LYN (B cells) mediated-Tyr379 phosphorylation and its subsequent binding to adaptor protein SLP-76 (T cells) or BLNK (B cells) (Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48). Activated HPK1 phosphorylates SLP-76 on Ser376 or BLNK on Thr152, leading to the recruitment of signaling molecule 14-3-3 and ultimate ubiquitination-mediated degradation of SLP-76 or BLNK (Liou, J., et al., Immunity, 2000. 12(4): p. 399-408; Di Bartolo, V., et al., J Exp Med, 2007. 204(3): p. 681-91). As SLP-76 and BLNK are essential for TCR/BCR-mediated signaling activation (e.g. ERK, phospholipase Cγ1, calcium flux, and NFAT activation), HPK1-mediated downregulation of these adaptor proteins provide a negative feedback mechanism to attenuate signaling intensity during T cell or B cell activation (Wang, X., et al., J Biol Chem, 2012. 287(14): p. 11037-48).
The bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BDMCs) from HPK1 knockout mice showed higher expression of co-stimulatory molecules (e.g. CD80/CD86) and enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-12, TNF-α etc), and demonstrated superior ability to stimulate T cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo as compared to wild-type DCs (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). These data suggest that HPK1 is also an important negative regulator of dendritic cell activation (Alzabin, S., et al., J Immunol, 2009. 182(10): p. 6187-94). However, the signaling mechanisms underlying HPK-1 mediated negative regulation of DC activation remains to be elucidated.
In contrast, HPK1 appears to be a positive regulator of suppressive functions of regulatory T cells (Treg) (Sawasdikosol, S. et al., The journal of immunology, 2012. 188(supplement 1): p. 163). HPK1 deficient mouse Foxp3+ Tregs were defective in suppressing TCR-induced effector T cell proliferation, and paradoxically gained the ability to produce IL-2 following TCR engagement (Sawasdikosol, S. et al., The Journal of Immunology, 2012. 188(supplement 1): p. 163). These data suggest that HPK1 is an important regulator of Treg functions and peripheral self-tolerance.
HPK1 was also involved in PGE2-mediated inhibition of CD4+ T cell activation (Ikegami, R., et al., J Immunol, 2001. 166(7): p. 4689-96). Studies published in US 2007/0087988 indicated that HPK1 kinase activity was increased by exposure to physiological concentrations of PGE2 in CD4+ T cells and this effect was mediated by PEG2-induced PKA activation. The proliferation of HPK1 deficient T cells was resistant to the suppressive effects of PGE2 (see US 2007/0087988). Therefore, PGE2-mediated activation of HPK1 may represent a novel regulatory pathway of modulating immune response.

Formulation, Dosage Forms and Administration
When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the present disclosure can be administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. Thus the present disclosure provides a composition comprising a compound of Formula (I) or any of the formulas as described herein, a compound as recited in any of the claims and described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or any of the embodiments thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. These compositions can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art, and can be administered by a variety of routes, depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is indicated and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including transdermal, epidermal, ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including intranasal, vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary (e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal or intranasal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal intramuscular or injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. Parenteral administration can be in the form of a single bolus dose, or may be, e.g., by a continuous perfusion pump. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable.
This invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions which contain, as the active ingredient, the compound of the present disclosure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients. In some embodiments, the composition is suitable for topical administration. In making the compositions of the invention, the active ingredient is typically mixed with an excipient, diluted by an excipient or enclosed within such a carrier in the form of, e.g., a capsule, sachet, paper, or other container. When the excipient serves as a diluent, it can be a solid, semi-solid, or liquid material, which acts as a vehicle, carrier or medium for the active ingredient. Thus, the compositions can be in the form of tablets, pills, powders, lozenges, sachets, cachets, elixirs, suspensions, emulsions, solutions, syrups, aerosols (as a solid or in a liquid medium), ointments containing, e.g., up to 10% by weight of the active compound, soft and hard gelatin capsules, suppositories, sterile injectable solutions and sterile packaged powders.
In preparing a formulation, the active compound can be milled to provide the appropriate particle size prior to combining with the other ingredients. If the active compound is substantially insoluble, it can be milled to a particle size of less than 200 mesh. If the active compound is substantially water soluble, the particle size can be adjusted by milling to provide a substantially uniform distribution in the formulation, e.g., about 40 mesh.
The compounds of the invention may be milled using known milling procedures such as wet milling to obtain a particle size appropriate for tablet formation and for other formulation types. Finely divided (nanoparticulate) preparations of the compounds of the invention can be prepared by processes known in the art see, e.g., WO 2002/000196.
Some examples of suitable excipients include lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, mannitol, starches, gum acacia, calcium phosphate, alginates, tragacanth, gelatin, calcium silicate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, cellulose, water, syrup and methyl cellulose. The formulations can additionally include: lubricating agents such as talc, magnesium stearate and mineral oil; wetting agents; emulsifying and suspending agents; preserving agents such as methyl- and propylhydroxy-benzoates; sweetening agents; and flavoring agents.

In some embodiments, the polyethylene oxide is polyethylene oxide WSR 1105 (e.g., Polyox WSR 1105™).
In some embodiments, a wet granulation process is used to produce the composition. In some embodiments, a dry granulation process is used to produce the composition.
The compositions can be formulated in a unit dosage form, each dosage containing from about 5 to about 1,000 mg (1 g), more usually about 100 mg to about 500 mg, of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 10 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 50 mg of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, each dosage contains about 25 mg of the active ingredient. The term “unit dosage forms” refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.
The components used to formulate the pharmaceutical compositions are of high purity and are substantially free of potentially harmful contaminants (e.g., at least National Food grade, generally at least analytical grade, and more typically at least pharmaceutical grade). Particularly for human consumption, the composition is preferably manufactured or formulated under Good Manufacturing Practice standards as defined in the applicable regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. For example, suitable formulations may be sterile and/or substantially isotonic and/or in full compliance with all Good Manufacturing Practice regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
The active compound may be effective over a wide dosage range and is generally administered in a therapeutically effective amount. It will be understood, however, that the amount of the compound actually administered will usually be determined by a physician, according to the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms and the like.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, e.g., the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day. The dosage is likely to depend on such variables as the type and extent of progression of the disease or disorder, the overall health status of the particular patient, the relative biological efficacy of the compound selected, formulation of the excipient, and its route of administration. Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical excipient to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of a compound of the present invention. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, the active ingredient is typically dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition can be readily subdivided into equally effective unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from, e.g., about 0.1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention.
The tablets or pills of the present invention can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permit the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of materials can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.
The liquid forms in which the compounds and compositions of the present invention can be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include aqueous solutions, suitably flavored syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavored emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles.
Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. In some embodiments, the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions can be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be breathed directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device can be attached to a face mask, tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions can be administered orally or nasally from devices which deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner.
Topical formulations can contain one or more conventional carriers. In some embodiments, ointments can contain water and one or more hydrophobic carriers selected from, e.g., liquid paraffin, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, propylene glycol, white Vaseline, and the like. Carrier compositions of creams can be based on water in combination with glycerol and one or more other components, e.g., glycerinemonostearate, PEG-glycerinemonostearate and cetylstearyl alcohol. Gels can be formulated using isopropyl alcohol and water, suitably in combination with other components such as, e.g., glycerol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like. In some embodiments, topical formulations contain at least about 0.1, at least about 0.25, at least about 0.5, at least about 1, at least about 2 or at least about 5 wt % of the compound of the invention. The topical formulations can be suitably packaged in tubes of, e.g., 100 g which are optionally associated with instructions for the treatment of the select indication, e.g., psoriasis or other skin condition.
The amount of compound or composition administered to a patient will vary depending upon what is being administered, the purpose of the administration, such as prophylaxis or therapy, the state of the patient, the manner of administration and the like. In therapeutic applications, compositions can be administered to a patient already suffering from a disease in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the symptoms of the disease and its complications. Effective doses will depend on the disease condition being treated as well as by the judgment of the attending clinician depending upon factors such as the severity of the disease, the age, weight and general condition of the patient and the like.
The compositions administered to a patient can be in the form of pharmaceutical compositions described above. These compositions can be sterilized by conventional sterilization techniques, or may be sterile filtered. Aqueous solutions can be packaged for use as is, or lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous carrier prior to administration. The pH of the compound preparations typically will be between 3 and 11, more preferably from 5 to 9 and most preferably from 7 to 8. It will be understood that use of certain of the foregoing excipients, carriers or stabilizers will result in the formation of pharmaceutical salts.
The therapeutic dosage of a compound of the present invention can vary according to, e.g., the particular use for which the treatment is made, the manner of administration of the compound, the health and condition of the patient, and the judgment of the prescribing physician. The proportion or concentration of a compound of the invention in a pharmaceutical composition can vary depending upon a number of factors including dosage, chemical characteristics (e.g., hydrophobicity), and the route of administration. For example, the compounds of the invention can be provided in an aqueous physiological buffer solution containing about 0.1 to about 10% w/v of the compound for parenteral administration. Some typical dose ranges are from about 1 μg/kg to about 1 g/kg of body weight per day. In some embodiments, the dose range is from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg of body weight per day.

Effective doses can be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems.
Labeled Compounds and Assay Methods
The compounds of the present disclosure can further be useful in investigations of biological processes in normal and abnormal tissues. Thus, another aspect of the present invention relates to fluorescent dye, spin label, heavy metal or radio-labeled compounds provided herein that would be useful not only in imaging techniques but also in assays, both in vitro and in vivo, for localizing and quantitating HPK1 protein in tissue samples, including human, and for identifying HPK1 ligands by inhibition binding of a labeled compound. Accordingly, the present invention includes HPK1 binding assays that contain such labeled compounds.
The present invention further includes isotopically-substituted compounds of the disclosure. An “isotopically-substituted” compound is a compound of the invention where one or more atoms are replaced or substituted by an atom having the same atomic number but a different atomic mass or mass number. Compounds of the invention may contain isotopes in a natural abundance as found in nature. Compounds of the invention may also have isotopes in amounts greater to that found in nature, e.g., synthetically incorporating low natural abundance isotopes into the compounds of the invention so they are enriched in a particularly useful isotope (e.g., 2H and 13C). It is to be understood that a “radio-labeled” compound is a compound that has incorporated at least one isotope that is radioactive (e.g., radionuclide), e.g., 3H and 14C. Suitable radionuclides that may be incorporated in compounds of the present invention include but are not limited to 3H (also written as T for tritium), 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 18F, 35S, 36Cl, 82Br, 75Br, 76Br, 77Br, 123I, 124I, 125I and 131I. The radionuclide that is incorporated in the instant radio-labeled compounds will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled compound. In some embodiments the radionuclide is selected from the group consisting of 3H, 14C, 125I, 35S and 82Br. For in vitro HPK1 labeling and competition assays, compounds that incorporate 3H, 14C, 82Br, 125I, 131I, or 35S will generally be most useful. For radio-imaging applications 11C, 18F, 125I, 123I, 124I, 131I, 75Br, 76Br or 77Br will generally be most useful. Synthetic methods for incorporating radio-isotopes into organic compounds are known in the art.
Specifically, a labeled compound of the invention can be used in a screening assay to identify and/or evaluate compounds. For example, a newly synthesized or identified compound (i.e., test compound) which is labeled can be evaluated for its ability to bind a HPK1 protein by monitoring its concentration variation when contacting with the HPK1, through tracking of the labeling. For example, a test compound (labeled) can be evaluated for its ability to reduce binding of another compound which is known to bind to a HPK1 protein (i.e., standard compound). Accordingly, the ability of a test compound to compete with the standard compound for binding to the HPK1 protein directly correlates to its binding affinity. Conversely, in some other screening assays, the standard compound is labeled and test compounds are unlabeled. Accordingly, the concentration of the labeled standard compound is monitored in order to evaluate the competition between the standard compound and the test compound, and the relative binding affinity of the test compound is thus ascertained.
Kits
The present disclosure also includes pharmaceutical kits useful, e.g., in the treatment or prevention of diseases or disorders associated with the activity of HPK1, such as cancer or infections, which include one or more containers containing a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), or any of the embodiments thereof. Such kits can further include one or more of various conventional pharmaceutical kit components, such as, e.g., containers with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, additional containers, etc., as will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. Instructions, either as inserts or as labels, indicating quantities of the components to be administered, guidelines for administration, and/or guidelines for mixing the components, can also be included in the kit.
The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. The compounds of the Examples have been found to inhibit the activity of HPK1 according to at least one assay described herein.

Example B. p-SLP76S376 HTRF Assay
Compounds provided herein can be tested using the p-SLP76S376 HTRF assay as described below. Jurkat cells (cultured in RPMI1640 media with 10% FBS) are collected and centrifuged, followed by resuspension in appropriate media at 3×106 cells/ml. The Jurkat cells (35 ul) are dispensed into each well in a 384 well plate. Test compounds are diluted with cell culture media for 40 fold dilution (adding 39 ul cell culture media into 1 ul compound). The Jurkat cells in the well plate are treated with the test compounds at various concentrations (adding 5 ul diluted compound into 35 ul Jurkat cells and starting from 3 uM with 1:3 dilution) for 1 hour at 37° C., 5% CO2), followed by treatment with anti-CD3 (5 ug/ml, OKT3 clone) for 30 min. A 1:25 dilution of 100× blocking reagent (from p-SLP76 ser376HTRF kit) with 4×Lysis Buffer(LB) is made and 15 ul of the 4×LB buffer with blocking reagent is added into each well and incubated at room temperature for 45 mins with gentle shaking. The cell lysate (16 ul) is added into a Greiner white plate, treated with p-SLP76 ser376HTRF reagents (2 ul donor, 2 ul acceptor) and incubated at 4° C. for overnight. The homogeneous time resolved fluorescence (HTRF) is measured on a PHERAstar plate reader the next day. IC50 determination is performed by fitting the curve of percent inhibition versus the log of the inhibitor concentration using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
Example C. Isolation of CD4+ or CD8+ T Cells and Cytokine Measurement
Blood samples are collected from healthy donors. CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are isolated by negative selection using CD4+ or CD8+ enrichment kits (lifetech, USA). The purity of the isolated CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is determined by flow cytometry and is routinely >80%. Cells are cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, glutamine and antibiotics (Invitrogen Life Technologies, USA). For cytokine measurement, Jurkat cells or primary CD4+ or CD8+ T cells are plated at 200 k cells/well and are stimulated for 24 h with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 beads in the presence or absence of testing compounds at various concentrations. 16 μL of supernatants are then transferred to a white detection plate and analyzed using the human IL2 or IFNγ assay kits (Cisbio).
Example D. Treg Assay
One or more compounds can be tested using the Regulatory T-cell proliferation assay described as following. Primary CD4+/CD25− T-cells and CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T-cells are isolated from human donated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells, using an isolated kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific (11363D). CD4+/CD25− T-cells are labeled with CFSE (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34554) following the protocol provided by the vendor. CFSE labeled T-cells and CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T-cells are re-suspended at the concentration of 1×106 cells/ml in RPMI-1640 medium. 100 μl of CFSE-labeled T-cells are mixed with or without 50 μl of CD4+/CD25+ regulatory T-cells, treated with 5 μl of anti-CD3/CD28 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11132D) and various concentrations of compounds diluted in 50 μl of RPMI-1640 medium. Mixed populations of cells are cultured for 5 days (37° C., 5% CO2) and proliferation of CFSE-labeled T-cells is analyzed by BD LSRFortessa X-20 using FITC channel on the 5th day.
