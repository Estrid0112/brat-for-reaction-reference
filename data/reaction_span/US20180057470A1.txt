FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
This disclosure relates to chemical entities, including compounds, as described herein; compositions containing them; methods of making them; and their use in various methods, including the treatment of depression, pain, dementia, and other neurological and peripheral disorders.
BACKGROUND
Discovered more than 50 years ago, ketamine is an anesthetic that is thought to act primarily by antagonizing the glutamatergic NMDAR (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor). It is typically administered intramuscularly or intravenously for starting and maintaining general anesthesia in humans and other animals, and has also been used for anti-anxiety, sedation, and analgesic purposes. See, e.g., Costi et al., Curr. Behav. Neurosci. Rep. 2015, 4. 216-225; Oddo et al., Crit. Care 2016, 20, 128-138. In addition, ketamine has shown potent efficacy in treating depression and pain when administered at sub-anesthetic doses; even single infusions of such doses appear to show rapid action in treating bipolar depression and treatment-resistant major depression. Iadarola et al., Ther. Adv. Chronic Dis. 2015, 6, 97-114; Zarate et al., Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 2006, 63, 856-864; Lally et al. Transl. Psychiatry 2014, 4, e469; Murrough et al., Am. J. Psychiatry 2013, 170, 1134-1142.
Clinical use of ketamine is limited, however, by its poor oral bioavailability, abuse liability, and undesirable psychological reactions, such as dissociative effects and hallucinations observed at even low doses. See, e.g., Strayer and Nelson, Am. J. Emerg. Med. 2008, 26, 985-1028; Morgan and Curran, Addiction 2010, 107, 27-38. In addition, ketamine action is complicated by multiple metabolites arising after its administration, many of which do not have anesthetic properties. See, e.g., Leung et al., J. Med. Chem. 1986, 29, 2396-2399.
Recent studies have shown that a ketamine metabolite, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine, has antidepressant activity in mice. Zanos et al., Nature 2016, 533, 481-486. In addition, hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolites have been implicated in the analgesic efficacy of ketamine in treating pain. Moaddel et al., Talanta 2010, 15, 1892-1904. In contrast to ketamine, HNK is not known to inhibit NMDAR, but is thought to modulate a different glutamate receptor, the AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor. Furthermore, the action of HNK does not appear to be associated with undesired effects that can result from ketamine therapy, such as abuse liability and anesthetic effects.
These observations highlight the need for alternative ketamine therapeutics useful in treating depression, pain, and other CNS disorders. The present disclosure meets these and other needs in the art by disclosing chemical entities, including compounds, which can act through HNK-mediated pathways.

Terms and Definitions
The use of headings and subheadings provided in the sections of this specification is solely for convenience of reference and does not limit the various embodiments herein, which are to be construed by reference to the specification as a whole.
General
As used herein, the term “about” or “approximately” means within an acceptable range for a particular value as determined by one skilled in the art, and may depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, e.g., the limitations of the measurement system or technique. For example, “about” can mean a range of up to 20%, up to 10%, up to 5%, or up to 1% or less on either side of a given value. Alternatively, with respect to biological systems or processes, the term “about” can mean within an order of magnitude, within 5-fold, or within 2-fold on either side of a value. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate unless stated otherwise, meaning that the term “about” or “approximately” can be inferred when not expressly stated.
To provide a more concise description, some of the quantitative expressions given herein are not qualified with the term “about”. It is understood that, whether the term “about” is used explicitly or not, every quantity given herein is meant to refer to the actual given value, and it is also meant to refer to the approximation of such given value that would reasonably be inferred based on the ordinary skill in the art, including equivalents and approximations due to the experimental or measurement conditions for such given value. Whenever a yield is given as a percentage, such yield refers to a mass of the entity for which the yield is given with respect to the maximum amount of the same entity for which that could be obtained under the particular stoichiometric conditions. Concentrations that are given as percentages refer to mass ratios, unless indicated differently.
As used herein, the terms “a,” “an,” and “the” are to be understood as meaning both singular and plural, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, “a,” “an,” and “the” (and grammatical variations thereof where appropriate) refer to one or more.
Furthermore, although items, elements or components of the embodiments may be described or claimed in the singular, the plural is contemplated to be within the scope thereof, unless limitation to the singular is explicitly stated.
The terms “comprising” and “including” are used herein in their open, non-limiting sense. Other terms and phrases used in this document, and variations thereof, unless otherwise expressly stated, should be construed as open ended, as opposed to limiting. Thus, the term “example” is used to provide exemplary instances of the item in discussion, not an exhaustive or limiting list thereof. Similarly, adjectives such as “conventional,” “traditional,” “normal,” “criterion,” “known,” and terms of similar meaning should not be construed as limiting the item described to a given time period or to an item available as of a given time, but instead should be read to encompass conventional, traditional, normal, or criterion technologies that may be available or known now or at any time in the future. Likewise, where this document refers to technologies that would be apparent or known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such technologies encompass those apparent or known to the skilled artisan now or at any time in the future.
The presence of broadening words and phrases such as “one or more,” “at least,” “but not limited to,” or other like phrases in some instances should not be read to mean that the narrower case is intended or required in instances where such broadening phrases may be absent. As will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art after reading this document, the illustrated embodiments and their various alternatives may be implemented without confinement to the illustrated examples.
Chemistry
The term “substituted,” as used herein, means that at least one hydrogen on the designated atom or group is replaced with a selection from the indicated group, provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogen atoms on the atom are replaced.
A dash (“-”) that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of covalent attachment for a substituent. For example, -(CH2)C3-C7cycloalkyl is attached through carbon of the methylene (CH2) group.
The term “alkyl” refers to a fully saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group. The alkyl moiety may be a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain. Examples of alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (Me, which also may be structurally depicted by the symbol, “<img> id-US20180057470A1-20180301-P00001.TIF </img>”), ethyl (Et), n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl (tBu), pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples. Alkyl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents including, but not limited to, halo, hydroxyl, alkoxy, thioalkoxy, amino, and aminoalkyl.”), ethyl (Et), n-propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl (tBu), pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, and groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples. Alkyl groups may be optionally substituted with one or more substituents including, but not limited to, halo, hydroxyl, alkoxy, thioalkoxy, amino, and aminoalkyl.
The term “alkenyl” refers to optionally substituted unsaturated aliphatic moieties having at least one carbon-carbon double bond and including E and Z isomers of said alkenyl moiety. Examples of alkenyl radicals include ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, 1,4-butadienyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl and the like.
The term “alkynyl” refers to optionally substituted unsaturated aliphatic moieties having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond and includes straight and branched chain alkynyl groups. Examples of alkynyl radicals include ethynyl, propynyl, butynyl and the like.
The term “haloalkyl” refers to a straight- or branched-chain alkyl group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain, substituting one or more hydrogens with halogens.

The term “alkoxy” includes a straight chain or branched alkyl group with an oxygen atom linking the alkyl group to the rest of the molecule. Alkoxy includes methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, isopropoxy, butoxy, t-butoxy, pentoxy and so on. “Aminoalkyl,” “thioalkyl,” and “sulfonylalkyl” are analogous to alkoxy, replacing the terminal oxygen atom of alkoxy with, respectively, NH (or NR), S (sulfur), and SO2.
The term “haloalkoxy” refer to alkoxy groups substituting one or more hydrogens with halogens. Examples of haloalkoxy groups include, but are not limited to, -OCF3, -OCH2CF3, -OCH2CHF2, -OCH2CH2Cl, -OCH2CF2CF3, -OCH(CH3)CHF2 and other groups that in light of the ordinary skill in the art and the teachings provided herein, would be considered equivalent to any one of the foregoing examples.
The term “amino” refers to the -NH2 group.
The term “heteroatom” used herein refers to, for example, O (oxygen), S (sulfur), N (nitrogen), and Selenium (Se).
The term “aryl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused or spiro polycyclic, aromatic carbocycle (ring structure having ring atoms that are all carbon), having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring (carbon atoms in aryl groups are sp2 hybridized). Illustrative examples of aryl groups include the following moieties:
<img> id-US20180057470A1-20180301-C00003.TIF </img>
and the like.
The term “cycloalkyl” refers to a saturated or partially saturated carbocycle, such as monocyclic, fused polycyclic, bridged monocyclic, bridged polycyclic, spirocyclic, or spiro polycyclic carbocycle having from 3 to 12 ring atoms per carbocycle. Where the term cycloalkyl is qualified by a specific characterization, such as monocyclic, fused polycyclic, bridged polycyclic, spirocyclic, and spiro polycyclic, then such term cycloalkyl refers only to the carbocycle so characterized. Illustrative examples of cycloalkyl groups include the following entities, in the form of properly bonded moieties:
<img> id-US20180057470A1-20180301-C00004.TIF </img>
“Heterocycloalkyl” means a saturated cyclic group containing from 1 to about 3 heteroatoms chosen from N, O, S, and Se with remaining ring atoms being carbon. Heterocycloalkyl groups have from 3 to about 8 ring atoms, and more typically have from 5 to 7 ring atoms. Examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include morpholinyl, piperazinyl, piperidinyl, and pyrrolidinyl groups. A nitrogen in a heterocycloalkyl group may optionally be quaternized. A “heterocycloalkyl” refers to a monocyclic, or fused, bridged, or spiro polycyclic ring structure that is saturated or partially saturated and has from 3 to 12 ring atoms per ring structure selected from carbon atoms and up to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, selenium, and sulfur.

<img> id-US20180057470A1-20180301-C00006.TIF </img>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that the species of cycloalkyl, aryl, heterocycloalkyl, and heteroaryl groups listed or illustrated above are not exhaustive, and that additional species within the scope of these defined terms may also be selected.
The term “halogen” represents chlorine, fluorine, bromine or iodine; and the term “halo” represents chloro, fluoro, bromo or iodo.
The terms “optional” and “optionally” refer to the subsequently described event or circumstance and mean that it may or may not occur, and that the description includes instances where the event or circumstance occurs and instances or circumstances where it does not. For example, “optionally substituted alkyl” encompasses both “unsubstituted alkyl” and “substituted alkyl” as defined below. It will be understood by those skilled in the art, with respect to any group containing one or more substituents, that such groups are not intended to introduce any substitution or substitution patterns that are sterically impractical, synthetically non-feasible and/or inherently unstable.
Formulas
Certain compounds are described herein using a general formula that includes variables, e.g. R1-R12.
Any formula disclosed herein is intended to represent compounds having structures depicted by the structural formula as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds of any formula given herein may have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms. All optical isomers and stereoisomers of the compounds of the general formula, and mixtures thereof, are considered within the scope of the formula. Thus, any formula given herein is intended to represent a racemate, one or more enantiomeric forms, one or more diastereomeric forms, one or more atropisomeric forms, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, certain structures may exist as geometric isomers (i.e., cis and trans isomers), as tautomers, or as atropisomers. The symbols are used as meaning the same spatial arrangement in chemical structures shown herein. Analogously, the symbols are used as meaning the same spatial arrangement in chemical structures shown herein.
The term “chiral” refers to molecules, which have the property of non-superimposability of the mirror image partner.
“Stereoisomers” are compounds, which have identical chemical constitution, but differ with regard to the arrangement of the atoms or groups in space.
A “diastereomer” is a stereoisomer with two or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different physical properties, e.g., melting points, boiling points, spectral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers may separate under high resolution analytical procedures such as electrophoresis, crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column.
“Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a compound, which are non-superimposable mirror images of one another. A 50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process.
Stereochemical definitions and conventions used herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Ed., McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, S., Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically active compound, the prefixes D and L or R and S are used to denote the absolute configuration of the molecule about its chiral center(s). The prefixes d and l or (+) and (−) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-polarized light by the compound, with (−) or l meaning that the compound is levorotatory. A compound prefixed with (+) or d is dextrorotatory.
A “racemic mixture” or “racemate” is an equimolar (or 50:50) mixture of two enantiomeric species, devoid of optical activity. A racemic mixture may occur where there has been no stereoselection or stereospecificity in a chemical reaction or process.
Chemical Entities
As used herein, the term “chemical entity” collectively refers to a compound, along with its salts, chelates, solvates, conformers, non-covalent complexes, metabolites, and prodrugs.
Compounds disclosed herein are described using standard nomenclature. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.
As used herein, a “compound” refers to any one of: (a) the actually recited form of such compound; and (b) any of the forms of such compound in the medium in which the compound is being considered when named. For example, reference herein to a compound such as R-COOH, encompasses reference to any one of, for example, R-COOH(s), R-COOH(sol), and R-COO-(sol). In this example, R-COOH(s) refers to the solid compound, as it could be for example in a tablet or some other solid pharmaceutical composition or preparation; R-COOH(sol) refers to the un-dissociated form of the compound in a solvent; and R-COO-(sol) refers to the dissociated form of the compound in a solvent, such as the dissociated form of the compound in an aqueous environment, whether such dissociated form derives from R-COOH, from a salt thereof, or from any other entity that yields R-COO- upon dissociation in the medium being considered.
In another example, an expression such as “exposing an entity to a compound of formula R-COOH” refers to the exposure of such entity to the form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such exposure takes place. In still another example, an expression such as “reacting an entity with a compound of formula R-COOH” refers to the reacting of (a) such entity in the chemically relevant form, or forms, of such entity that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such reacting takes place, with (b) the chemically relevant form, or forms, of the compound R-COOH that exists, or exist, in the medium in which such reacting takes place. In this regard, if such entity is for example in an aqueous environment, it is understood that the compound R-COOH is in such same medium, and therefore the entity is being exposed to species such as R-COOH(aq) and/or R-COO-(aq), where the subscript “(aq)” stands for “aqueous” according to its conventional meaning in chemistry and biochemistry. A carboxylic acid functional group has been chosen in these nomenclature examples; this choice is not intended, however, as a limitation but it is merely an illustration. It is understood that analogous examples can be provided in terms of other functional groups, including but not limited to hydroxyl, basic nitrogen members, such as those in amines, and any other group that interacts or transforms according to known manners in the medium that contains the compound. Such interactions and transformations include, but are not limited to, dissociation, association, tautomerism, solvolysis, including hydrolysis, solvation, including hydration, protonation and deprotonation. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because these interactions and transformations in a given medium are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art.
In another example, a “zwitterionic” compound is encompassed herein by referring to a compound that is known to form a zwitterion, even if it is not explicitly named in its zwitterionic form. Terms such as zwitterion, zwitterions, and their synonyms zwitterionic compound(s) are standard IUPAC-endorsed names that are well known and part of standard sets of defined scientific names. In this regard, the name zwitterion is assigned the name identification CHEBI:27369 by the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) dictionary of molecular entities. As is generally well known, a zwitterion or zwitterionic compound is a neutral compound that has formal unit charges of opposite sign. Sometimes these compounds are referred to by the term “inner salts”. Other sources refer to these compounds as “dipolar ions”, although the latter term is regarded by still other sources as a misnomer. As a specific example, aminoethanoic acid (the amino acid glycine) has the formula H2NCH2COOH, and it exists in some media (in this case in neutral media) in the form of the zwitterion +H3NCH2COO-. Zwitterions, zwitterionic compounds, inner salts, and dipolar ions in the known and well established meanings of these terms are within the scope of this invention, as would in any case be so appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. Because there is no need to name each and every embodiment that would be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art, no structures of the zwitterionic compounds that are associated with the compounds of this invention are given explicitly herein. They are, however, part of the embodiments of this invention. No further examples in this regard are provided herein because the interactions and transformations in a given medium that lead to the various forms of a given compound are known by any one of ordinary skill in the art.
Isotopes may be present in the compounds described. Each chemical element present in a compound either specifically or generically described herein may include any isotope of said element. Any formula given herein is also intended to represent unlabeled forms as well as isotopically labeled forms of the compounds. Isotopically labeled compounds have structures depicted by the formulas given herein except that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having a selected atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, such as 2H (deuterium), 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, and 125I, respectively.
When referring to any formula given herein, the selection of a particular moiety from a list of possible species for a specified variable is not intended to define the same choice of the species for the variable appearing elsewhere. That is, where a variable appears more than once, the choice of the species from a specified list is independent of the choice of species for the same variable elsewhere in the formula, unless otherwise stated.
By way of a first example on substituent terminology, if substituent S1example is one of S1 and S2, and substituent S2example is one of S3 and S4, then these assignments refer to embodiments of this invention given according to the choices S1example is S1 and S2example is S3; S1example is S1 and S2example is S4; S1example is S2 and S2example is S3; S1example is S2 and S2example is S4; and equivalents of each one of such choices. The shorter terminology “S1example is one of S1 and S2 and “S2example is one of S3 and S4 is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity but not by way of limitation. The foregoing first example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, and R13, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.
Furthermore, when more than one assignment is given for any member or substituent, embodiments of this invention comprise the various groupings that can be made from the listed assignments, taken independently, and equivalents thereof. By way of a second example on substituent terminology, if it is herein described that substituent Sexample is one of S1, S2 and S3, the listing refers to embodiments of this invention for which Sexample is S1; Sexample is S2; Sexample is S3; Sexample is one of S1 and S2; Sexample is one of S1 and S3; Sexample is one of S2 and S3; Sexample is one of S1, S2 and S3; and Sexample is any equivalent of each one of these choices. The shorter terminology “Sexample is one of S1, S2 and S3” is accordingly used herein for the sake of brevity, but not by way of limitation. The foregoing second example on substituent terminology, which is stated in generic terms, is meant to illustrate the various substituent assignments described herein. The foregoing convention given herein for substituents extends, when applicable, to members such as R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11, R12, and R13, and any other generic substituent symbol used herein.
The nomenclature “Ci-j” with j>i, when applied herein to a class of substituents, is meant to refer to embodiments of this invention for which each and every one of the number of carbon members, from i to j including i and j, is independently realized. By way of example, the term C1-3 refers independently to embodiments that have one carbon member (C1), embodiments that have two carbon members (C2), and embodiments that have three carbon members (C3).
The term Cn-malkyl refers to an aliphatic chain, whether straight or branched, with the total number N of carbon members in the chain that satisfies n≦N≦m, with m>n.
According to the foregoing interpretive considerations on assignments and nomenclature, it is understood that explicit reference herein to a set implies, where chemically meaningful and unless indicated otherwise, independent reference to embodiments of such set, and reference to each and every one of the possible embodiments of subsets of the set referred to explicitly.
Compositions
The term “composition,” as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation, or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
The term “therapeutically effective amount” or “effective amount” means an amount effective, when administered to a human or non-human patient, to provide any therapeutic benefit. A therapeutic benefit may be an amelioration of symptoms, e.g., an amount effective to decrease the symptoms of a depressive disorder, cognitive disorder, or pain. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound is also an amount sufficient to provide a significant positive effect on any indicia of a disease, disorder, or condition e.g. an amount sufficient to significantly reduce the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms or pain. A significant effect on an indicia of a disorder or condition includes a statistically significant in a standard parametric test of statistical significance such as Student's T-test, where p<0.05; though the effect need not be significant in some embodiments.
A “pharmaceutical compositions” is a composition comprising at least one active agent, such as a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, of Formula (I), and at least one other substance, such as a carrier, excipient, or diluent.
The term “carrier” applies to pharmaceutical compositions of the disclosure and refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which an active compound is administered.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable,” as used in connection with compositions of the invention, refers to molecular entities and other ingredients of such compositions that are physiologically tolerable and do not typically produce untoward reactions when administered to an animal (e.g., human). The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” may also mean approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals (e.g. mammals), and more particularly in humans.
A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a substance that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, and otherwise biologically suitable for administration to a subject, such as an inert substance, added to a pharmacological composition or otherwise used as a vehicle, carrier, or diluents to facilitate administration of an agent and that is compatible therewith. Examples of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils, and polyethylene glycols. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include those described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005).
A “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to mean a salt of a free acid or base of a compound represented by Formula (I) that is non-toxic, biologically tolerable, or otherwise biologically suitable for administration to the subject. See, generally, G. S. Paulekuhn et al., J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 6665-6672; Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1977, 66, 1-19; Stahl and Wermuth (eds), Pharmaceutical Salts; Properties, Selection, and Use: 2nd Revised Edition, Wiley-VCS, Zurich, Switzerland (2011). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those that are pharmacologically effective and suitable for contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, or allergic response. A compound of Formula (I) may possess a sufficiently acidic group, a sufficiently basic group, or both types of functional groups, and accordingly react with a number of inorganic or organic bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt bases, and inorganic and organic acids, to form a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
The term “carrier” refers to an adjuvant, vehicle, or excipients, with which the compound is administered. In preferred embodiments of this invention, the carrier is a solid carrier. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include those described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins (2005).
The term “dosage form,” as used herein, is the form in which the dose is to be administered to the subject or patient. The drug is generally administered as part of a formulation that includes nonmedical agents. The dosage form has unique physical and pharmaceutical characteristics. Dosage forms, for example, may be solid, liquid or gaseous. “Dosage forms” may include for example, a capsule, tablet, caplet, gel caplet (gelcap), syrup, a liquid composition, a powder, a concentrated powder, a concentrated powder admixed with a liquid, a chewable form, a swallowable form, a dissolvable form, an effervescent, a granulated form, and an oral liquid solution. In a specific embodiment, the dosage form is a solid dosage form, and more specifically, comprises a tablet or capsule.
As used herein, the term “inert” refer to any inactive ingredient of a described composition. The definition of “inactive ingredient” as used herein follows that of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as defined in 21 C.F.R. 201.3(b)(8), which is any component of a drug product other than the active ingredient.
Methods and Uses
As used herein, the term “disorder” is used interchangeably with “disease” or “condition”. For example, a neurological disorder also means a neurological disease or a neurological condition.
As used herein, the term “cognitive impairment” is used interchangeably with “cognitive dysfunction” or “cognitive deficit,” all of which are deemed to cover the same therapeutic indications.
The terms “treating,” “treatment,” and “treat” cover therapeutic methods directed to a disease-state in a subject and include: (i) preventing the disease-state from occurring, in particular, when the subject is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (ii) inhibiting the disease-state, e.g., arresting its development (progression) or delaying its onset; and (iii) relieving the disease-state, e.g., causing regression of the disease state until a desired endpoint is reached. Treating also includes ameliorating a symptom of a disease (e.g., reducing the pain, discomfort, or deficit), wherein such amelioration may be directly affecting the disease (e.g., affecting the disease's cause, transmission, or expression) or not directly affecting the disease.
As used in the present disclosure, the term “effective amount” is interchangeable with “therapeutically effective amount” and means an amount or dose of a compound or composition effective in treating the particular disease, condition, or disorder disclosed herein, and thus “treating” includes producing a desired preventative, inhibitory, relieving, or ameliorative effect. In methods of treatment according to the invention, “an effective amount” of at least one compound according to the invention is administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal). In some embodiments, an “effective amount” also means an amount or dose of a compound or composition effective to modulate an HNK-associated signaling pathway, such as a glutamatergic pathway. The “effective amount” will vary, depending on the compound, the disease, the type of treatment desired, and its severity, and age, weight, of the subject, etc.
The term “animal” is interchangeable with “subject” and may be a vertebrate, in particular, a mammal, and more particularly, a human, and includes a laboratory animal in the context of a clinical trial or screening or activity experiment. Thus, as can be readily understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, the compositions and methods of the present invention are particularly suited to administration to any vertebrate, particularly a mammal, and more particularly, a human. Medical treatment can include treatment of an existing condition, such as a disease or disorder, prophylactic or preventative treatment, or diagnostic treatment. In some embodiments the patient is a human patient.
As used herein, a “control animal” or a “normal animal” is an animal that is of the same species as, and otherwise comparable to (e.g., similar age, sex), the animal that is trained under conditions sufficient to induce transcription-dependent memory formation in that animal.
A “patient” means any human or non-human animal in need of medical treatment. Medical treatment can include treatment of an existing condition, such as a disease or disorder, prophylactic or preventative treatment, or diagnostic treatment. In some embodiments the patient is a human patient.
“Administering” means introducing into the body of a subject a chemical entity, such as a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, or a composition containing such a chemical entity, for use via any appropriate route, for example, oral administration in either solid or liquid dosage form.
By “enhance,” “enhancing,” or “enhancement” is meant the ability to potentiate, increase, improve or make greater or better, relative to normal, a biochemical or physiological action or effect. For example, enhancing long term memory formation refers to the ability to potentiate or increase long term memory formation in an animal relative to (or “compared to”) the normal long term memory formation of the animal or controls. As a result, long term memory acquisition is faster or better retained. Enhancing performance of a cognitive task refers to the ability to potentiate or improve performance of a specified cognitive task by an animal relative to the normal performance of the cognitive task by the animal or controls.
As used herein, the terms “training protocol,” or “training,” refer to either “cognitive training” or “motor training.”

Solvates
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides a solvate of a compound of Formula (I), or a solvate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formula (I), and the use of such solvates in methods of present invention.
Solvates can be formed from the interaction or complexes of compounds of the invention with one or more solvents, either in solution or as a solid or crystalline form. Such solvent molecules are those commonly used in the pharmaceutical art, which are known to be innocuous to the recipient, e.g., water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and the like. Other solvents may be used as intermediate solvates in the preparation of more desirable solvates, such as methanol, methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, (S)-propylene glycol, (R)-propylene glycol, 1,4-butyne-diol, and the like. Hydrates include compounds formed by an incorporation of one or more water molecules.
Polymorphs
In certain embodiments, compounds of Formula (I) may exist in crystalline form. A polymorph (or crystalline form) is a composition having the same chemical formula, but a different solid state or crystal structure. In addition, certain crystalline forms of compounds of Formula (I) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula (I) are obtainable as co-crystals.
Prodrugs
The term “prodrug” means a precursor of a designated compound that, following administration to a subject, yields the compound in vivo via one or more physiochemical or physiological processes, such as chemical hydrolysis or enzymatic cleavage. In some embodiments, more than one process may be required to yield the compound in vivo. For example, a compound of Formula (I), upon administration in vivo, may undergo both hydrolysis and enzymatic conversion.
In some embodiments, the chemical entities of Formula (I) are prodrugs designed to yield, in vivo, a suitable yield of the ketamine metabolite, HNK. That is, in some embodiments, chemical entities of Formula (I) are precursors of HNK and therefore can yield biologically available HNK upon administration to a subject.
In some embodiments, prodrugs may be obtained from further derivatization of compounds of Formula (I). Prodrugs may be generated using techniques known or available in the art (e.g., Bundgard (ed.), 1985, Design of prodrugs, Elsevier; Krogsgaard-Larsen et al., (eds.), 1991, Design and Application of Prodrugs, Harwood Academic Publishers). Prodrugs may be produced, for instance, by derivatizing free carboxyl groups of structures of Formula (I) as amides or alkyl esters, or by derivatizing free hydroxy groups using groups including hemisuccinates, phosphate esters, dimethylaminoacetates, and phosphoryloxymethyloxycarbonyls, following procedures such as those outlined in Fleisher et al., Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 1996, 19, 115-130.
Metabolites
The present disclosure also relates to a metabolite of a compound of Formula (I), as defined herein, and salts thereof. The present invention further relates to the use of such metabolites, and salts thereof, in methods of present invention, including therapeutic methods.
Metabolites of a compound may be determined using routine techniques known or available in the art. For example, isolated metabolites can be enzymatically and synthetically produced (e.g., Bertolini et al., J. Med. Chem. 1997, 40, 2011-2016; Shan et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 1997, 86, 765-767; Bagshawe, Drug Dev. Res. 1995, 34, 220-230; and Bodor, Adv Drug Res. 1984, 13, 224-231).
In preferred embodiments, the metabolite corresponds to HNK. Without being limited by mechanism, compounds of Formula (I) may undergo one or more physiological processes following administration, resulting in HNK and other byproducts. In some embodiments, the byproduct of such processes may include an amino acid or carboxylic acid.
Compositions
Compounds disclosed herein can be administered as the neat chemical, but are preferably administered as a composition. The term “composition,” as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s) and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation, or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the disclosure provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a chemical entity of any of the embodiments and examples disclosed herein; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In some embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, of any of the embodiments and examples disclosed herein; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In specific embodiments, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound of any one of Examples 1-61; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
The pharmaceutical composition may contain a compound or salt of Formula (I) as the only active agent, but preferably contains at least one additional active agent. In certain embodiments the pharmaceutical composition is an oral dosage form that contains from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg, from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, or from about 10 mg to about 200 mg of a compound of Formula (I) and optionally from about 0.1 mg to about 2000 mg, from about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, from about 100 mg to about 800 mg, or from about 200 mg to about 600 mg of an additional active agent in a unit dosage form.
In some embodiments, compounds of Formula (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, are used, alone or in combination with one or more additional active ingredients, to formulate pharmaceutical compositions.
Formulations and Administration
Procedures for preparing various formulations suitable for administering are known in the art. Examples of potential formulations and preparations are contained, for example, in the Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, American Pharmaceutical Association (current edition); Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets (Lieberman, Lachman and Schwartz, editors) current edition, published by Marcel Dekker, Inc., as well as Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Osol, ed.),1980, 1553-1593.
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing an animal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, buccal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like.
Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water, and the like. The particular carrier, diluent, or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Some carriers may be listed in more than one class, for example vegetable oil may be used as a lubricant in some formulations and a diluent in others. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to an animal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG400, PEG300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., medicament).
The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., a compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent)) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable and appropriate dosage of the drug.
The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways, depending upon the method used to administer the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings.
The present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or a similar edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
Carriers may include excipients and diluents and must be of sufficiently high purity and sufficiently low toxicity to render them suitable for administration to the patient being treated. The carrier can be inert or it can possess pharmaceutical benefits of its own. The amount of carrier employed in conjunction with the compound is sufficient to provide a practical quantity of material for administration per unit dose of the compound.
Useful solid carriers may include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina, and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.
The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral administration. Preferred oral dosage forms are formulated for once a day or twice a day administration. The compositions contain between 0.1 and 99% weight of a compound of Formula (I). In some embodiments, compositions contain at least about 5% weight of a compound of Formula (I). In some embodiments, compositions contain from about 25% to about 50% weight of a compound of Formula (I), or about 5% to 75% weight of a compound of Formula (I).
Dosages
Useful dosages of the compounds of Formula (I) can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art. Useful dosages of the compounds of Formula (I) can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949).
Optimal dosages to be administered in the therapeutic methods of the present invention may be determined by those skilled in the art and will depend on multiple factors, including the particular composition in use, the strength of the preparation, the mode and time of administration, and the advancement of the disease or condition. Additional factors may include characteristics on the subject being treated, such as age, weight, gender, and diet.
In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg, more specifically from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg, such as 10 to about 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, 3 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, 0.5 to 90 mg/kg/day, or 1 to 60 mg/kg/day (or any other value or range of values therein). The compound is conveniently administered in a unit dosage form; for example, containing about 1 to 1000 mg, particularly about 10 to 750 mg, and more particularly, about 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of temporally-distinct administrations used according to the compositions and methods of the present invention.
Effective amounts or doses of the active agents of the present invention may be ascertained by routine methods such as modeling, dose escalation studies or clinical trials, and by taking into consideration routine factors, e.g., the mode or route of administration or drug delivery, the pharmacokinetics of the agent, the severity and course of the disease, disorder, or condition, the subject's previous or ongoing therapy, the subject's health status and response to drugs, and the judgment of the treating physician. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful composition is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained. An exemplary dose is in the range from about 0.001 to about 200 mg of active agent per kg of subject's body weight per day, preferably about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg/day, or about 1 to 35 mg/kg/day, or about 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/daily in single or divided dosage units (e.g., BID, TID, QID). For a 70-kg human, an illustrative range for a suitable dosage amount is from 1 to 200 mg/day, or about 5 to 50 mg/day.
In certain embodiments a therapeutically effect amount is an amount that provide a plasma Cmax of HNK of about of 0.25 mcg/mL to about 125 mcg/mL, or about 1 mcg/mL to about 50 mcg/mL.
Methods and Uses
Uses of Isotopically-Labeled Compounds
In one aspect, the present invention provides a method of using isotopically labeled compounds the present invention in: (i) metabolic studies (preferably with 14C), reaction kinetic studies (with, for example 2H or 3H); (ii) detection or imaging techniques, including drug or substrate tissue distribution assays; or (iii) in radioactive treatment of patients.
Isotopically labeled compounds and prodrugs of the invention thereof can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes or in the examples and preparations described below by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. An 18F or 11C labeled compound may be particularly preferred for PET, and an I123 labeled compound may be particularly preferred for SPECT studies. Further substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H) may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements.
Recent research suggests that low-dose ketamine can act as a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant [Naughton et al. 2014]. In fact, a single subanesthetic dose infusion of ketamine has rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant major depression and bipolar depression [Iadarola et al. 2015]. Ketamine as an antidepressant agent is of great interest as an alternative to the delayed onset to efficacy, repeated administration and unwanted side effects of current pharmacotherapeutics, behavioral therapies and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).
Therapeutic Methods
Generally
In some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) of treating certain disorders by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of the present invention. In some embodiments, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the subject is a human.
In some embodiments, a chemical entity of Formula (I) may be the only active agent administered in methods disclosed herein or may be administered together with an additional active agent.
In some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) of enhancing neuronal plasticity-an essential property of the brain that can be augmented in healthy animals and impaired in numerous CNS disorders. Without being limited by mechanism, such chemical entities may enhance neuronal plasticity by enhancing cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB) pathway function in cells, resulting in the modulation of transcription of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. See, e.g., Tully et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003, 2, 267-277; Alberini, Physiol. Rev. 2009, 89, 121-145. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of enhancing neuronal plasticity, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of the present invention. In some embodiments, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.
In some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) to augment the efficiency of training protocols, which facilitate functional reorganization in targeted “domains” (or “functions”) in the brain. Training protocols can be directed to rehabilitating or enhancing a cognitive or motor function. The training protocol (cognitive or motor training) induces neuronal activity in specific brain regions and produces improved performance of a specific brain (cognitive or motor) function. In such protocols, chemical entities may act as “augmenting agents” to shorten the time that methods of rehabilitating (or enhancing) a cognitive or motor function result in improved performance or a functional gain.
Such augmented training therefore comprises a specific training protocol for a particular brain function, such as that underlying declarative memory, performance of a fine motor skill, a specific locomotor function, language acquisition, executive function, etc., and a general administration of an augmenting agent.
Neurological Disorders
In some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) of treating a neurological disorder, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity or composition of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human.
In some embodiments, the methods are directed to a cognitive deficit (“cognitive impairment”) or motor deficit (“motor impairment”) associated with (or “due to”) the neurological disorder. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the disclosure provides a method for treating a cognitive deficit associated with a neurological disorder, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I).
A neurological disorder (or condition or disease) is any disorder of the body's nervous system. Neurological disorders can be categorized according to the primary location affected, the primary type of dysfunction involved, or the primary type of cause. The broadest division is between peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders and central nervous system (CNS) disorders (such as mental and psychiatric disorders). Neurological disorders are well-known in the art, and they include, but are not limited to, the following mental and psychiatric disorders:
Neurodevelopmental (or “developmental” disorders), such as intellectual disability disorders (e.g., Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Down syndrome); communication disorders; autism-spectrum disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders; specific learning, language, or reading (e.g., dyslexia) disorders; motor disorders; fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD); and other neurodevelopmental disorders;
Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia, schizotypal (personality) disorder, delusional disorder, and schizophreniform disorder, and other schizophrenia spectrum and psychotic disorders;
Bipolar and related disorders, such as Bipolar I and II disorders, cyclothymic disorders, and other bipolar and related disorders;
Depressive disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and other depressive disorders;
Anxiety disorders, such as specific phobia, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder (social phobia);

Substance-related and addictive disorders, such as those involving alcohol, drugs, stimulants, opioids, tobacco, and non-substance-related disorders; and other substance-related and addictive disorders; and
Personality disorders, such as paranoid personality disorders, antisocial and borderline personality disorders, avoidance personality disorders, and other personality disorders.
In particular embodiments, the disorder is schizophrenia.
In other embodiments, the neurological disorder is an acquired disorder, in which the primary clinical feature is impaired cognition. In other words, it is a disorder in which the primary cognitive deficit has not been present since birth or very early life and therefore represents a decline from a previously attained level of functioning. Such disorders, which may be referred to herein as “cognitive disorders” or “neurocognitive disorders” include one or more of the following:
Delirium, such as substance-intoxication (or withdrawal) delirium, medication-induced delirium, and other forms of delirium;
Dementias and other cognitive impairments due to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Lewy body disease, Pick's disease, a prion disease (e.g., Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and corticobasal degeneration; dementia due to a vascular disease (“vascular disease”); and other dementias and neurodegenerative diseases;
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides a method of treating a neurological disorder, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof an effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the neurological disorder is selected from the group consisting of a depressive disorder, a pain disorder, a cognitive disorder, and a neurodegenerative disorder, and a sleep disorder.
Age-associated cognitive deficits, including age-associated memory impairment (AAMI), also referred to as age-related memory impairment (AMI) (See, e.g., Crook et al., Devel. Neuropsychol. 1986, 2, 261-276); and deficits affecting patients in early stages of cognitive decline, as in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (See, e.g., Arnáiz and Almkvist, Acta Neurol. Scand. Suppl. 2003, 179, 34-41).
Trauma-dependent losses of cognitive function, such as vascular diseases due to stroke (e.g., ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke) or ischemia; microvascular disease arising from diabetes or arthrosclerosis; traumatic brain injury (TBI), such as brain trauma, including subdural hematoma and brain tumor; head trauma (closed and penetrating); head injury; tumors, such as nervous system cancers, including cerebral tumors affecting the thalamic or temporal lobe; hypoxia, and viral infection (e.g., encephalitis); excitotoxicity; and seizures.
Cognitive impairments due to chemotherapy, such as post-chemotherapy cognitive impairments (PCCI); chemotherapy-induced cognitive dysfunction or impairments; chemo brain; or chemo fog.
Such acquired disorders are not necessarily limited to cognitive impairments. For example, trauma related disorders, such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, head trauma, and head injury, may also include impairments in other neurological functions, such as impairments in motor functions.
Migraine variants, such as chronic migraine, basilar migraine, vertebrobasilar migraine, status migrainosus, and other forms of migraine;
As used herein, the terms “Neurodevelopment disorders,” “Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders,” “Mood disorders,” “Bipolar and related disorders,” “Depressive disorders,” “Anxiety disorders,” “Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders,” “Dissociative disorders,” “Disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders,” “Trauma- and stressor-related disorders,” “Feeding and eating disorders,” “Sleep-wake disorders,” “Sexual disorders,” “Substance-related and addictive disorders,” Personality disorders,” “Delirium,” “Neurocognitive disorders,” “Delirium,” “Dementias,” and “Trauma” includes treatment of those mental disorders as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5; 5th ed., 2013, American Psychiatric Association). The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures and classification systems for mental disorders, and that these systems evolve with medical and scientific progress. Thus the terms described in this paragraph are intended to include like disorders that are described in other diagnostic sources.
Depressive Conditions
In some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) of treating a depressive condition (disorder), comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity or composition of the present disclosure. In one aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For example, anti-depressant-like effects of low ketamine doses are associated with elevated AMPA receptor function, supporting favorable physiochemical properties for HNK in disclosed methods. See, e.g., Tizabi et al., Neuroscience 2012, 213, 72-80.
In a specific aspect, the depressive disorder is major depressive disorder (MDD) (also referred to as “major depression” or “clinical depression”). In another aspect, the depressive disorder is persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). MDD and dysthymia are among the most common depressive disorders. Other depressive disorders that can be treated include, but are not limited to, psychotic depression, postpartum depression, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a mood disorder; depression due to another medical condition such as cancer, chronic pain, chronic stress, post-traumatic stress disorder, or a bipolar disorder.
A depressive condition is characterized by one or more depressive symptoms. “Depressive symptoms” may include feelings of persistent anxiousness, sadness, helplessness, hopelessness, worthlessness, or pessimism; low energy; low mood; restlessness; irritability; fatigue; loss of interest in pleasurable activities or hobbies; aversion to activity; poor concentration or indecisiveness; excessive guilt; insomnia; excessive sleepiness; overeating; loss of appetite; thoughts of suicide; and suicide attempts.
The presence, severity, frequency, and duration of depressive symptoms vary on a case to case basis. In some embodiments, a patient may have at least one, at least two, at least three, at least four, or at least five of these symptoms. Depressive symptoms may occur in the context of depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, mood disorders due to a general medical condition, substance-induced mood disorders, and other unspecified mood disorders. In addition, depressive symptoms may also be present in association with other psychiatric disorders, including, but not limited to, psychotic disorders, cognitive disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders and personality disorders. The longitudinal course of the disorder, the history, and type of symptoms, and etiologic factors help distinguish the various forms of mood disorders from each other.
A “depression symptoms rating scale” refers to any one of a number of standardized questionnaires, clinical instruments, or symptom inventories utilized to measure symptoms and symptom severity in depression. Such rating scales are often used in clinical studies to define treatment outcomes, based on changes from the study's entry point(s) to endpoint(s). Such depression symptoms rating scales include, but are not limited to, The Quick Inventory of Depressive-Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR16), the 17-Item Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD17), the 30-Item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C30), or The Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Such ratings scales may involve patient self-report or be clinician rated. A 50% or greater reduction in a depression ratings scale score over the course of a clinical trial (starting point to endpoint) is typically considered a favorable response for most depression symptoms rating scales. “Remission” in clinical studies of depression often refers to achieving at, or below, a particular numerical rating score on a depression symptoms rating scale (for instance, less than or equal to 7 on the HRSD17; or less than or equal to 5 on the QIDS-SR16; or less than or equal to 10 on the MADRS). Such a score generally corresponds to minimal symptoms and therefore a clinically desired outcome.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, the disclosure provides a method for treating a symptom of depression, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I). In one aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In preferred embodiments, the subject is a human. In one aspect, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount effective to achieve remission on a depression symptoms rating scale. In one aspect, the rating scale is HRSD17, QIDS-R16, or MADRS. In another aspect, a therapeutically effective amount is an amount effective to decrease symptoms, wherein a decrease in depressive symptoms is at least a 50% reduction of symptoms identified on a depression symptom rating scale, or a score less than or equal to 7 on the HRSD17, or less than or equal to 5 on the QID-SR16, or less than or equal to 10 on the MADRS.
In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be used to treat major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder is typically defined as the presence of one or more major depressive episodes that are not better accounted for by psychotic disorder or bipolar disorder. For major depressive disorder, an essential feature is a period of at least 2 weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure is nearly all activities, and for persistent depressive disorder, an essential feature is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, for more days that not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year for children and adolescents. See, American Psychiatry Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition).
In connection with treatment, “recovery” means that remission, as defined herein, has sufficiently been sustained, e.g., for 4 months or more, without a “relapse” (such that continued well-being is expected). A relapse means that the patient has experienced a return of the same index major depressive episode (e.g., severe major depression) before reaching achieving the criteria for recovery. A “recurrence” refers to the development of a new major depressive disorder following recovery.
Accordingly, in some embodiments, chemical entities of the present invention are useful in methods (or in the manufacture of a medicament or composition for use in such methods) of treating major depressive disorder, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a chemical entity or composition of the present disclosure. In one aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, treatment results in recovery without a relapse. In some embodiments, treatment prevents relapse in subjects who previously achieved symptom remission. In some embodiments, treatment prevents recurrence in subjects who previously attained recovery from an initial major depressive disorder. In some embodiments, treatment prevents recurrence for a period of 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or longer.
In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure can be used to treat treatment resistant (or “treatment refractory”) depression. A treatment resistant patient may be identified as one who fails to experience alleviation of one or more symptoms of depression (e.g., persistent anxious or sad feelings, feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, pessimism) despite undergoing one or more standard pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment. In certain embodiments, a treatment-resistant patient is one who fails to experience alleviation of one or more symptoms of depression despite undergoing treatment with two different antidepressant drugs. In other embodiments, a treatment-resistant patient is one who fails to experience alleviation of one or more symptoms of depression despite undergoing treatment with four different antidepressant drugs. A treatment-resistant patient may also be identified as one who is unwilling or unable to tolerate the side effects of one or more standard pharmacological or non-pharmacological treatment.
Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods for treating treatment-resistant depression by administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the treatment-resistant depression is unipolar depression, including major depression, including unipolar major depression. In some embodiments, the treatment-resistant depression is bipolar depression, including a major depressive episode associated with a bipolar disorder. In some embodiments, methods of treating depression are contemplated when a patient has suffered depression for e.g., 5, 6, 7, 8 or more weeks, or for a month or more. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating suicidal ideation. Suicidal ideations is generally associated with depressive and other mood disorder. In addition, it also can be associated with other mental disorders, life events, and family events, all of which may increase the risk of suicidal ideation. For example, many individuals with borderline personality disorder exhibit recurrent suicidal behavior and suicidal thoughts. Ketamine (and its metabolites) can offer a therapeutic option in patients at imminent risk of suicide. See, e.g., Ballard et al., J. Psych. Res. 2014, 58, 161-166; Wilkinson and Sanacora, Depress. Anxiety 2016, 33, 711-717.
Accordingly, in specific embodiments, the disclosure provides a method of treating suicidal ideation, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a specific aspect, suicidal ideation is associated with a depressive disorder.
In some embodiments, the present disclosure provides methods for rapidly treating a depressive disorder or condition. Current antidepressants generally take several weeks or more to produce a response. Recent research, however, suggests that a single low-dose of ketamine can act as a novel, rapid-acting antidepressant with minimal side effects. Naughton et al., J. Affect. Dis 2014,156, 24-35; Muller et al., Ther. Adv. Psychopharmacol. 2016, 6, 185-192. Moreover, recent work indicates that the metabolism of (R,S)-ketamine to HNK is essential for its antidepressant effects, and that the (2R,6R)-HNK enantiomer exerts behavioral, electroencephalographic, electrophysiological and cellular antidepressant-related actions in mice. Zanos et al., Nature 2016, 533, 481-486. These results underscore favorable physiochemical properties for HNK that are pertinent in the development of rapid acting agents in depression with particular importance to treatment-resistant depressive disorders and depressive disorders with suicidal ideation. See, e.g., DiazGranados et al., J Clin Psychiatry 2010, 71, 1605-1611; Cusin et al., Am. J. Psych. 2012, 169, 868-869; Larkin et al., Int. J Neuropsych. 14, 1127-1131; Abdallah et al., Depress. Anxiety 2016, 33, 689-697. Obsessive Compulsive Disorders
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Without being limited by mechanisms, several lines of neurochemical and genetic evidence suggest that glutamate dysregulation may contribute to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and that targeting glutamate may be beneficial in treating refractory disease. Kariuki-Nyuthe et al., Curr. Opin. Psych. 2014, 27, 32-37; Rodriguez et al., Neuropsychopharmacology. 2013, 38, 2475-2483; Pittenger, Psychiatr. Ann. 2015, 45, 308-315. OCD may there therefore be amenable to treatment by modulators of glutamate signaling, which can include chemical entities of the present disclosure.
Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the disclosure provides methods for treating OCD, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
Anxiety
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating an anxiety disorder, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In a specific embodiment, chemical entities, including compounds, of the present disclosure are used as anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) agents to treat an anxiety disorder.
Bipolar Disorders
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating a bipolar disorder, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In a specific embodiment, the bipolar disorder is bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, cyclothymic disorder, or other bipolar and related disorders.
Trauma- and Stressor-Related Disorders
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating trauma- and stressor-related disorders, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I) or composition of the present disclosure. In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Trauma- and stressor-related disorders involve exposure to a traumatic or stressful event. See, e.g., Zhang et al., Psychopharmacology 2015, 232, 663-672. In one embodiment, the disorder is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including chronic PTSD. See, e.g., Feder et al., JAMA Psychiatry 2014, 71, 681-688. In another embodiment, the disorder is acute stress disorder (ASD).
In some embodiments, the disclosure provides methods of treating pain. For example, sub-anesthetic does of (R,S)-ketamine have demonstrated efficacy in treating neuropathic and chronic pain, including the treatment of patients suffering from complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Goldberg et al., Pain Physician 2010, 13, 379-387. Moreover, analysis of plasma samples obtained from CRPS patients receiving (R,S)-ketamine as a 5-day continuous infusion reveals that the primary drug, (R,S)-ketamine, is not primarily responsible for the therapeutic response and instead that the active agents responsible for the therapeutic response may include HNK metabolites. Moaddel et al., Talanta 2010, 15, 1892-1904. More generally, ketamine may be useful as an effective analgesic in treating postoperative pain, chronic pain, intractable cancer pain, uncontrolled severe pain, acute and subacute pain in opioid-tolerant patients, and pain in palliative care patients. See, e.g., Hirota and Lambert, Br. J. Anaesth. 2001, 107, 123-126; Lossignol et al., Support Care Cancer 2005, 13, 188-93; Chazan et al., J. Opioid Manag. 2008, 4, 173-180; Carstensen and Møllerand, Br. J. Anaesth. 2010, 104, 410-406; Beaudoin et al., Acad. Emerg. Med. 2014, 11, 1193-1202.
Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the disclosure provides methods for treating pain, comprising administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a chemical entity of Formula (I). In a specific aspect, the chemical entity is a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In some embodiments, an effective amount is an amount effective to decrease painful symptoms, wherein a decrease in painful symptom is at least a 50% reduction of painful symptoms on a pain rating scale.
In some embodiments, pain is associated with a neurological disorder. In particular embodiments, pain is associated with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). In some embodiments, pain is associated with chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia, and may include muscle pain, myofascial pain, temporal summation, and referred pain. See, e.g., Graven-Nielsen et al., Pain. 2000, 85, 483-491; Bennett, Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1998, 10, 95-103.
In some embodiments, the pain is chronic pain, acute pain, subacute pain, neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, cancer pain, inflammatory pain, visceral pain, migraine pain, headache, and menstrual pain.

Models for Evaluating Anti-Depressant Activity
In this prophetic example, animal behavioral tests known in the art are used to evaluate the antidepressant efficacy of exemplary compounds of Formula (I). Such tests may be based on various attributes of depression, such as behavioral despair (e.g., Forced Swim), anxiety (e.g., Novelty Suppressed Feeding test), or exposure to uncontrollable stressors (e.g., Learned Helplessness).
Forced Swim Test
The Forced Swim Test (FST) is a widely used tool in depression research-particularly for evaluating the acute efficacy of candidate antidepressants. In the FST, mice are placed in an inescapable transparent tank filled with water and are evaluated for their escape related mobility behavior. See, e.g., Can et al., 2012, J. Vis. Exp. 59, e3638.
In some embodiments, mice are administered exemplary compounds of Formula (I) and exhibit a longer duration of escape-directed behaviors in the FST, compared to vehicle-administered controls.
Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test:
The Novelty Suppressed Feeding Test (NSFT) is based on the rationale that feeding to novelty is an anxiety symptom in rodents that can be evoked by novel environmental features, including novel food, novel testing area, and novel food containers. See, e.g., Santarelli et al., 2003, Science 301, 805-809. The test reflects the anti-anxiety effects of antidepressants, with a response measured after administration with candidate antidepressants.
In some embodiments, mice are administered exemplary compounds of Formula (I) and exhibit a decreased latency to feed in the NSFT, compared to vehicle-administered controls.
Learned Helplessness:
The learned helplessness test (LHT) is based on the observation that animals develop deficits in escape, cognitive and rewarded behaviors when subjected to repeated unavoidable and uncontrollable shocks. See, e.g., J. B. Overmier and Seligman, 1967, J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 63, 28-33; Chourbaji et al., 2005, Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 16, 70-78; Zanos et al., 2016, Nature 533, 481-486.
In some embodiments, mice are administered exemplary compounds of Formula (I) and exhibit reduced deficits in the LHT, compared to vehicle-administered controls.
Pharmacokinetic Studies
In this prophetic example, pharmacokinetic profiles of Formula (I) compounds are obtained by standard means known in the art. For example, the pharmacokinetic profiles can be obtained from animals, such as mammals, including primates (e.g., monkeys such as Rhesus Macaques (Macaca mulatta), or humans).
Comparisons between pharmaceutical compositions can be readily achieved through the examination of pharmacokinetic profiles and/or parameters measured after administration of a composition. Generally, a blood baseline drug concentration is obtained prior to administration.
Post-administration, blood is drawn at various time points for drug analysis. Typically, serum or plasma is isolated from the blood samples and analyzed to determine the concentrations of the therapeutic agent. Drug concentrations in plasma (or serum) samples are analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy using appropriate parameters for each compound.
Typically, a graph is created of the time (x-axis) versus drug concentration (y-axis) and from this graph various pharmacokinetic parameters can be derived. Alternately, the data can be entered into a software program that will derive the pharmacokinetic parameters and fit them to a graph of the measured values.
Useful pharmacokinetic parameters in which to compare formulations include maximal blood therapeutic concentration (Cmax), time to reach Cmax (Tmax), time to reach a blood concentration of ½ of Cmax (T1/2), and bioavailability (BA). Typically, BA is measured by determining an area under the curve (AUC) of a blood therapeutic concentration versus time graph. For comparative analysis between pharmaceutical compositions, the pharmacokinetic parameters can be compared individually, or in various combinations. Numerous, but non-limiting, pharmacokinetic software programs can be used in practicing the teachings of the present disclosure, such Phoenix WinNonlin software, version 5.2.
Exemplary compounds of the present disclosure are tested for oral bioavailability. For such studies, the compounds can be dissolved in various vehicles (e.g. PEG 400 solution and CMC suspension) for intravenous and oral dosing in the rats. Following administration, plasma samples are obtained and extracted. The plasma concentrations of the starting compound and HNK metabolite are determined by high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) methods. Pharmacokinetic analyses are performed based on the plasma concentration data.
In some embodiments, pharmacokinetic data are analyzed, and significant levels of HNK metabolite are observed following oral administration of formula (I) compounds. Without being limited by mechanism, conversion of exemplary compounds of Formula (I) to the HNK may include one or more of a physiochemical, metabolic, or enzymatic process.
Therapeutic Administration of Formula (I) Compositions
The ability of compounds of the present disclosure to treat the disorders described herein can be evaluated using a suitably designed clinical study, such as that summarized below for a depressive disorder.
In this prophetic example, a clinical trial comprises a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple (21-day) dose study in twenty otherwise-healthy male and female patients with moderate-to-severe, major depressive disorder (as defined by the American Psychiatry Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th edition) and confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) of severity (as assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale).
The patients are randomized into 2 cohorts. Subjects in cohort 1 receive single doses of a Formula (I) solid dosage formulation on days 1-21. Subject in cohort 2 are identical to those for cohort 1, except that they receive single doses of placebo on days 1-21.
For each cohort, multiple parameters, including pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and pharmacodynamics (PD) data are evaluated. In addition, cognitive function in Cohorts 1 and 2 is assessed using the CogState testing method, which comprises a customizable range of computerized cognitive tasks able to measure baseline and change in all cognitive domains. Specialized tasks in CogState can assess attention, memory, executive function, as well as language and social-emotional cognition.
Under the dosing duration of 3 weeks (21 days), there is evidence of Formula (I) compound-induced changes on PD endpoints that indicate an antidepressant effect. There is also evidence of a rapid onset of antidepressant effects, in some cases following a single dose. In addition, there is evidence of compound-induced changes in cognitive domain function.
In another prophetic example, comparable results are obtained from a similarly-designed clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of Formula (I) compounds in treating male and female patients with treatment-resistant depression (as defined by the American Psychiatry Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th Edition).
Conversion of Formula (I) Compositions
In this prophetic example, exemplary compounds of Formula (I) yield HNK upon administration to a subject, such as a patient in a clinical trial, in one or more steps. For example, in one possible pathway illustrated in the following schematic, exemplary compounds of Formula (I) may yield HNK in a two-step process, consisting of hydrolysis in Step 1 under acid conditions, such as those in the stomach, and subsequent enzymatic conversion by esterase action.
