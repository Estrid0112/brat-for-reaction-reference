TECHNICAL FIELD
The presently-disclosed subject matter generally relates to substituted phenothiazine derivatives that contain substituents at the 1,10 position or at the 1,9,10 position that raise oxidation potentials regardless of whether the substituent is electron-donating or electron withdrawing, without necessarily concomitantly raising reduction potentials.
INTRODUCTION
The redox potentials of π-conjugated organic molecules and polymers are important factors that determine, in part, their performance in organic electronic devices and in energy collection and storage applications. In these systems, the general prescriptions to control redox potentials involve substitution with electron-donating and/or electron-withdrawing groups, making use of the well-known Hammett constants as predictors of the extent of the change of redox potentials,[1] and/or modifying the length of the π-conjugation pathway, e.g. going from ethylene to butadiene to hexatriene and beyond.
Another route to modify molecular redox potentials exploits strain-induced disruptions of the π-conjugated framework) Such chemical modifications typically use so-called bulky substituents to manipulate the dihedral torsions among the π-conjugated moieties that make up the molecular systems. Prime examples include biphenyl (or more generally oligo- or polyphenylenes), where substituents incorporated at the 2, 2', 6, and/or 6' positions increase the twist angle between the phenyl groups, and oligothiophenes, where similar tactics are employed with substituents placed at the 3 and/or 4 positions) Notably, these considerations have been widely used in the development of π-conjugated polymers for electronics and solar cell applications.
Strain has also been used to instill curvature into π-conjugated networks to alter optical and/or redox characteristics, for example in fullerenes,[4] cyclized stilbenes,[5] and twisted acenes (so-called ‘twistacenes’).[6] In each of these latter examples, the π-conjugated networks are strained in both the ground (neutral) and ionized (oxidized or reduced) electronic states.
Molecular redox shuttles can be used to mitigate excess current in overcharging batteries by spatially ferrying charge through a series of electron-transfer reactions, oxidizing to their radical-cation form at the cathode and reducing to their neutral form at the anode. For molecules designed to mitigate overcharge in LIBs, chemical substitutions are made to adjust the oxidation potentials with respect to the reduction potential of the cathode to ensure that the shuttles become redox active just after a cell is fully charged.[8] Extensive overcharge protection has been demonstrated for lower-voltage LiFePO4 cathodes,[8a,9] which require shuttles that oxidize at potentials of 3.8 to 3.9 V vs. Li+/0. However, the protection of higher-voltage cathodes (i.e. LiCoO2, LiMnO2, and LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2) require oxidation potentials of 4.2 V or higher, and no shuttle has provided extensive protection in cells containing graphitic anodes.
Maximizing both the energy density and the durability of a LIBs requires charging to a precise voltage: below that potential, the full capacity of the cell is not utilized; at higher potentials, a cell enters overcharge, a condition that can seriously degrade LIBs and lead to hazardous operating conditions.[8]
The road to higher oxidation potential shuttles via the incorporation of strong electron-withdrawing groups on viable low-voltage shuttles can introduce perils in the framework of LIB s. Electron-withdrawing substituents shift both the oxidation and reduction potentials to more positive values, producing compounds that are more susceptible to decomposition through subsequent reactions after reduction to the radical anion at the anode.[7a,10] Premature failure of phenothiazine redox shuttles containing chlorine, bromine, cyano, or nitro groups can be traced back to having reduction potentials >0 V vs. Li+/0[7a,10e] Dimethoxybenzene derivatives containing strongly electron-withdrawing groups have short-lived performance in overcharge when incorporated into lithium-ion cells containing graphite anodes,[10a-d] perhaps as a result of reductive decomposition at the anode/electrolyte interface. This is supported by reports of the redox shuttle 1,4-di-tert-butyl-2,5-bis(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)benzene surviving 2× longer in a cells containing the Li4Ti5O12 anode when compared to LIBs with either the highly reducing graphitic or lithium metal anodes.[10]
As such, the incorporation of strongly electron-withdrawing groups is a problematic route for molecules that require stability at both high and low redox potentials. Thus, a new approach for designing stable, high-voltage redox shuttles is needed.

In defining various terms such as “R”, such terms are used herein as generic symbols to represent various specific substituents. These symbols can be any sub stituent, not limited to those disclosed herein, and when they are defined to be certain substituents in one instance, they can, in another instance, be defined as some other substituents.
The term “alkyl” as used herein is a branched or unbranched saturated hydrocarbon group of 1 to 24 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, s-butyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, s-pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, eicosyl, tetracosyl, and the like. The alkyl group can be cyclic or acyclic. The alkyl group can be branched or unbranched. The alkyl group can also be substituted or unsubstituted. For example, the alkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol, as described herein. A “lower alkyl” group is an alkyl group containing from one to six (e.g., from one to four) carbon atoms.
Throughout the specification “alkyl” is generally used to refer to both unsubstituted alkyl groups and substituted alkyl groups; however, substituted alkyl groups are also specifically referred to herein by identifying the specific substituent(s) on the alkyl group. For example, the term “halogenated alkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more halide, e.g., fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. The term “alkoxyalkyl” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more alkoxy groups, as described below. The term “alkylamino” specifically refers to an alkyl group that is substituted with one or more amino groups, as described below, and the like. When “alkyl” is used in one instance and a specific term such as “alkylalcohol” is used in another, it is not meant to imply that the term “alkyl” does not also refer to specific terms such as “alkylalcohol” and the like.
This practice is also used for other groups described herein. That is, while a term such as “cycloalkyl” refers to both unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl moieties, the substituted moieties can, in addition, be specifically identified herein; for example, a particular substituted cycloalkyl can be referred to as, e.g., an “alkylcycloalkyl.” Similarly, a substituted alkoxy can be specifically referred to as, e.g., a “halogenated alkoxy,” a particular substituted alkenyl can be, e.g., an “alkenylalcohol,” and the like. Again, the practice of using a general term, such as “cycloalkyl,” and a specific term, such as “alkylcycloalkyl,” is not meant to imply that the general term does not also include the specific term. The term “alkyl” is inclusive of “cycloalkyl.”
The term “cycloalkyl” as used herein is a non-aromatic carbon-based ring composed of at least three carbon atoms. Examples of cycloalkyl groups include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, norbornyl, and the like.

The cycloalkyl group and heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted or unsubstituted. The cycloalkyl group and heterocycloalkyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, amino, ether, halide, hydroxy, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol as described herein.

The terms “alkoxy” and “alkoxyl” as used herein to refer to an alkyl or cycloalkyl group bonded through an ether linkage; that is, an “alkoxy” group can be defined as -OA1 where A' is alkyl or cycloalkyl as defined above. “Alkoxy” also includes polymers of alkoxy groups as just described; that is, an alkoxy can be a polyether such as -OA1-OA2 or -OA1-(OA2)a-OA3, where “a” is an integer of from 1 to 200 and A1, A2, and A3 are alkyl and/or cycloalkyl groups.
The term “alkenyl” as used herein is a hydrocarbon group of from 2 to 24 carbon atoms with a structural formula containing at least one carbon-carbon double bond. The term is include of linear and ring-forming (i.e., cycloakenyl) groups. Asymmetric structures such as (A1A2)C═C(A3A4) are intended to include both the E and Z isomers. This can be presumed in structural formulae herein wherein an asymmetric alkene is present, or it can be explicitly indicated by the bond symbol C═C. The alkenyl group can be substituted with one or more groups including, but not limited to, optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkoxy, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkynyl, aryl, heteroaryl, aldehyde, amino, carboxylic acid, ester, ether, haide, hydroxy, ketone, azide, nitro, silyl, sulfo-oxo, or thiol, as described herein.
The term “aryl” as used herein is a group that contains any carbon-based aromatic group including, but not limited to, benzene, naphthalene, phenyl, biphenyl, phenoxybenzene, and the like. The term “aryl” also includes “heteroaryl,” which is defined as a group that contains an aromatic group that has at least one heteroatom incorporated within the ring of the aromatic group. Examples of heteroatoms include, but are not limited to, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus. Likewise, the term “non-heteroaryl,” which is also included in the term “aryl,” defines a group that contains an aromatic group that does not contain a heteroatom.

EXAMPLES
Example 1
Inspired by studies of molecular strain, the strategic placement of substituents on the phenothiazine core was investigated for use to tune molecular redox characteristics through geometric constraints, with minimal impact of the substituent electronic effects. Deliberate incorporation of substituents around the periphery of the phenothiazine core was also tested for ability to disrupt the relaxation of the radical-cation state, thereby increasing the oxidation potential when compared to the unsubstituted system.
Derivatives of N-substituted phenothiazines where substituents were incorporated at positions ortho to the nitrogen atom (1 and 9 positions) were evaluated for capability to prevent planarization of the oxidized species through steric interactions with the N-alkyl group.
The electrochemical characteristics of these derivatives were compared to a parent compound with only an N substituent, and to derivatives where the same substituents are incorporated at positions para to the nitrogen atom (3 and 7 positions) so that planarization in the oxidized state remains possible and the full electronic effects of the substituents would be in play. For the sake of clarity, these Examples will focus discussion on the N-ethyl derivatives, where EPT is the parent, 1,9-DMeEPT the crowded derivative, and 3,7-DMeEPT the uncrowded analogue (FIG. 1).
At the outset of the investigation, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level to predict molecular geometries in the neutral and radical-cation states and the adiabatic and vertical ionization potentials (IPs) of various substituted phenothiazines.
The neutral geometries of EPT, 3,7-DMeEPT, and 1,9-DMeEPT are quite similar, with the butterfly angles showing little variation (139-143°). However, as radical cations, EPT and 3,7-DMeEPT are significantly more planar(171°) than 1,9-DMeEPT)(157° (Table 1); note that 180° represents a fully planar phenothiazine. Similar trends are noted for the other 3,7- and 1,9-substituted phenothiazines in the series.

A series of phenothiazine derivatives have been studied, where the geometry of the oxidized (radical-cation) state tends to be planar, while the neutral ground state is bent.[7] In particular, for N-substituted phenothiazines (FIG. 1, left), the present inventors observed a correlation in the degree of molecular bending (referred to as the “butterfly angle”) of the radical-cation geometry and the ease of oxidation: From ethyl to iso-propyl to tert-butyl (EtPT, iPrPT, tBuPT), the increased substituent size led to a larger radical-cation butterfly angle and higher-potential oxidation events (Table 1). Importantly, this effect is opposite to what one would predict based on the Hammett constants of the substituents, suggesting that preventing planarization in radical cations may raise oxidation potentials, regardless of the substituent's Hammett constant.
DFT calculations predict 3,7-DMeEPT to have an adiabatic IP 0.24 eV smaller than EPT, consistent with measured oxidation potentials[9c] and expectations based on the electron-donating capability of a methyl group. However, 1,9-DMeEPT has an IP 0.20 eV larger than EPT (Table 1). Thus, for the two DMeEPT constitutional isomers, we observe a difference in IP of 0.44 eV. The IP trends are similar for 3,7-BCF3EPT and 1,9-BCF3EPT, with 1,9-BCF3EPT having a larger IP, though the IP range is smaller (0.15 V). These results showcase the considerable impact that steric crowding of the radical-cation state can have in order to increase the IP.
Similar trends are observed for the vertical IPs (Table 2). Notably, the relaxation energy (λ) in the radical-cation potential energy surface is smaller for 1,9-DMeEPT (at 0.27 eV) than for EPT and 3,7-DMeEPT (both at 0.40 eV), signifying the impact of the methyl groups at the 1 and 9 positions in limiting radical cation relaxation to a more planar configuration. Moreover, the vertical IPs for EPT and 1,9-DMeEPT are quite similar (differing by 0.07 eV), while that of 3,7-DMeEPT is much smaller than EPT (by 0.23 eV), revealing the differences in the electronic impact of methyl substituents in the 1 and 9 vs. 3 and 7 positions. Potential energy surfaces displaying these differences in terms of the adiabatic and vertical IPs and relaxation energies are represented in FIG. 2.

With computational results in hand that supported our hypothesis, 1,9-DMeEPT and related N-iso-propyl (1,9-DMeiPrPT) and N-phenyl (1,9-DMePhPT) derivatives (FIG. 1) were prepared for further study. Solid-state butterfly angles show good agreement with DFT calculations (Table 1). Importantly, the trends in oxidation potentials from CV experiments (FIG. 3) validated our hypothesis and computational results. Unlike 3,7-DMeEPT, which is more easily oxidized than EPT (by 0.13 V), 1,9-DMeEPT is harder to oxidize than EPT (by 0.28 V). Moreover, as the size of the radical-cation butterfly angle within the series of 1,9-dimethyl-substituted phenothiazines, the oxidation potentials increase further. Of the three 1,9-dimethyl-substituted derivatives, 1,9-DMePhPT has the highest oxidation potential. Notably, this trend does not follow that of the solely N-substituted equivalents (iPrPT is harder to oxidize than both EPT and PhPT),[7b] though within each series of three compounds, the oxidation potentials follow the same trends as the calculated adiabatic IPs and radical-cation butterfly angles. Furthermore, scans of the full electrochemical window (FIG. 4) show that reduction events remain inaccessible throughout the series, with solvent reduction occurring before a reduction event could be observed.
UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was used to explore electronic transitions in the neutral and radical-cation states. While the absorption profiles of neutral EPT and 3,7-DMeEPT are nearly identical, the absorption onsets of the 1,9-dimethyl-substituted derivatives are slightly blue-shifted (FIG. 5a). These changes in energy, although small, are consistent with trends in the energy of the S0→S1 transition energy determined by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations (Table 2). UV-vis spectra of the radical cations, generated by chemical oxidation, further reflect differences in the oxidized species (FIG. 5b). The absorption spectra of the radical cations of EPT and 3,7-DMeEPT show profiles consistent with the radical cations of several phenothiazine derivatives prepared in our laboratory: intense absorption features between 500-600 nm and low-energy, low-intensity bands between 650-950 nm.[7b,13] By contrast, the analogous absorption features for the 1,9-disubstituted derivatives occur at lower energies. These trends in transition energies are confirmed by TD-DFT calculations (Table 2). Our results suggest that variation in placement of methyl groups affects the electronic gap between the HOMO-1 and HOMO (using the nomenclature of the neutral species), which in turn influences the D1→D2 transition of the radical cation that is predominately HOMO-1→SOMO (singly-occupied molecular orbital) in nature. From DFT calculations, the HOMO of EPT and 1,9-DMeEPT are nearly isoenergetic, while that of 3,7-DMeEPT is energetically destabilized; this is consistent with the trends of the computed vertical IPs, confirming the validity of a Koopmans' theorem[14] (Janak's theorem[15] in the context of DFT) estimate of the verticals IP based on the HOMO energies. However, the HOMO-1 of 3,7-DMeEPT and 1,9-DMeEPT are of similar energy and energetically destabilized when compared to EPT, revealing the comparable electronic impact of the methyl groups on the HOMO-1 regardless of the methyl group location on the phenothiazine. The combination of these effects results in a smaller HOMO-1 to HOMO energy gap for 1,9-DMeEPT, which is found here to translate to a smaller first-excited-state transition energy of the radical cation.
In summary, by positioning traditionally electron-donating substituents in close proximity to the N substituent, the relaxation of the phenothiazine radical-cation state was disrupted with increased the oxidation potentials relative to their counterparts that are able to fully relax. This approach offers a strain-induced modulation of electrochemical properties orthogonal to conventional tuning by substituent character. The aim is to identify new organic materials with higher oxidation potentials while limiting access to reduction events by disrupting relaxation pathways in fused-ring systems.

Electrochemical Analysis. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with a CH Instruments 600D potentiostat using a three-electrode system with glassy carbon as the working electrode, freshly anodized Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Each solution contained 1.6 mM analyte and 0.1 M TBAPF6 in DCM. Voltammograms were recorded at a scan rate of 100 mV/s. Oxidation potentials are reported relative to ferrocenium/ferrocene)(Cp2Fe+/0. To calibrate samples, ferrocene or decamethylferrocene was used as an internal reference.
Voltammograms containing the internal reference-either ferrocene or decamethylferrocene-in which the first oxidation event of the phenothiazine derivative was accessed are shown in FIG. 11.
Voltammograms of the phenothiazines (note: no internal reference in these scans) are shown in FIG. 4 in which the full solvent window was scanned.

UV-Visible Spectroscopy. UV-vis spectra were obtained using optical glass cuvettes (Starna) with 1 cm path length on an Agilent 8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Spectra of neutral compounds were obtained in DCM at concentrations of 14 μM. Spectra of radical cations were obtained in anhydrous DCM by mixing 0.5 mL of a 0.5 mM solution of TBPASbCl6 in DCM with 2.0 mL of a solution that was 2.5 mM radical cation. The resultant solution contained 0.1 mM radical cation and 1.9 mM neutral analyte. After the cuvette was capped and mixed, UV-vis spectra were recorded immediately.
