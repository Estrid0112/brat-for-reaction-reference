[Technical Field]
The present invention relates to an amyloid fibril formation inhibitor. In particular, the present invention relates to a therapeutic agent or a preventive agent of a neurodegenerative disease by inhibition of amyloid fibril formation.
[Background Art]
The population of Japan is currently aging at a progressively faster rate, and the number of patients with dementia such as Alzheimer's disease is correspondingly increasing. The number of dementia patients at present is estimated to be approximately 4,500,000 people and it is predicted that the number of patients will continue to increase with aging in future. The care of such dementia patients involves large economic burden as well. The establishment of an effective therapy as soon as possible is urgently sought.
The three pathological features: (1) loss of nerve cells, (2) formation of plaque amyloid deposits (senile plaque), and (3) accumulation of fiber aggregates in nerve cells (neurofibrillary tangle) are commonly observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and these are causes of cognitive impairment (Alzheimer-type dementia), which is a clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease. Treatments of Alzheimer-type dementia currently conducted are symptomatic treatments which temporarily ameliorate symptoms of the dementia using a choline esterase inhibitor, an NMDA inhibitor, and the like. However, their effects are very limited and the establishment of a causal therapy that suppresses development and progression of Alzheimer's disease is strongly sought.
The establishment of a causal therapy of Alzheimer's disease requires elucidation of the pathogenic mechanism of Alzheimer's disease. Known Alzheimer's disease includes familial (hereditary) Alzheimer's disease, which is caused by genetic factors, and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, which has no genetic history. Currently, causative genes and risk factors of familial Alzheimer's disease are being revealed. Since pathological findings and clinical manifestations are common between familial Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease, it is predicted that a common mechanism exists in the process of disease onset. It is hoped that the study of the pathogenic mechanism of familial Alzheimer's disease leads to elucidation of the onset mechanism of sporadic Alzheimer's disease.
One of the causative genes of familial Alzheimer's disease is a gene encoding amyloid precursor protein (hereinafter, referred to as APP). APP is cleaved by β-secretase and γ-secretase to produce amyloid β (hereinafter, referred to as Aβ). There are two different Aβs that differ in the cleavage point in APP: Aβ40 consisting of 40 amino acids, and Aβ42 in which 2 amino acids are added to the C-terminus of Aβ40 Whereas Aβ40 is dominant in physiological amount of production, more Aβ42 is contained in senile plaques. Furthermore, it has been revealed that mutated APPs increase the expression ratio of Aβ42 and that Aβ42 is easier to agglutinate in comparison with Aβ40. From these facts, the following theory is proposed: Aβ42 first aggregates and, having them as nuclei, Aβ40 aggregates and accumulates, the formation of amyloid fibrils thereby progress, and Alzheimer's disease develops.
It has been found that the aggregation of Aβ in the brain starts with binding of Aβ to GM1 ganglioside (hereinafter, referred to as Gum1), constituting the nerve cell membrane, to form a complex (GM1-bound Aβ: hereinafter referred to as GAβ) (Non-Patent Documents 1 and 2). Moreover, it has been confirmed by the analysis using vesicles of artificial lipid membrane that GM1 assembles in the nerve cell membrane in a cholesterol concentration-dependent manner to form clusters and Aβ forms GAβ by specifically binding to these GM1 clusters (Non-Patent Document 3). Furthermore, it has been confirmed by the analysis using antibodies that specifically recognize GAβ that GAβ has a structure different from that of soluble Aβ (Non-Patent Document 4). From these findings, a hypothesis was proposed that when Aβ binds to GM1 clusters, it changes into GAβ having a different structure and this GAβ serves as "seeds" and promotes the aggregation of Aβ and a large number of research results that support this hypothesis have been obtained subsequently (Non-Patent Documents 5 to 9).
Various compounds have been developed and tested in clinical trials so far for developing a method for radical treatment/prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Examples of such conventionally well-known compounds include inhibitors of β-secretase, which cleaves at the N-terminal side of Aβ when Aβ is generated, and inhibitors of γ-secretase, which cleaves at the C-terminal side of Aβ (Patent Document 1, Non-Patent Document 10). These inhibitors have been expected to be capable of suppressing formation of amyloid fibrils by inhibiting the production of Aβ. However, APP is not the only specific substrate of β-secretase or γ-secretase. As a result, the γ-secretase inhibitors, in particular, have the problem of serious side effects due to the inhibition of Notch signals deeply involved in development and differentiation and also due to the inhibition of the physiological metabolism of APP itself. Also, a large number of low molecular weight compounds that inhibit polymerization of Aβ have been developed (Patent Documents 2 to 6). These compounds prevent the elongation of amyloid fibrils or divide the fibrils by inhibiting the polymerization of Aβ. However, it is suggested that polymerization of Aβ is restarted if the administration of the compound is stopped and there may be the possibility that the division of fibrils itself generates new seeds of polymerization and a sufficient suppressant effect has not been obtained on the formation of amyloid fibrils.
Meanwhile, a method for suppressing amyloid fibril formation using an antibody (4396C antibody) that specifically binds to GAβ has been reported (Patent Document 7). The 4396C antibody radically suppresses the formation of amyloid fibrils by specifically recognizing and binding to GAβ and inhibiting the Aβ polymerization with GAβ. However, there are problems in that production of an antibody is time consuming and costly. Moreover, agents containing an antibody have the problem that the mode of their administration is limited and clinical use thereof is difficult because there is a problem in delivery to the brain.

"Aβ" is a peptide produced by cleaving of APP with β-secretase and γ-secretase and includes Aβ40 and Aβ42 that differ in the number of amino acids due to the difference of the cleavage point in APP.
The "APP" may encompass human APPs consisting of amino acid sequences registered with RefSeq accession numbers NP_001129601.1, NP_001129602.1, NP_001191232.2, NP_958817.1, NP_001191231.1, NP_958816.1, NP_001191230.1, NP_000475.1, NP_001129488.1, and NP_001129603.1 in the RefSeq database at NCBI (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/RefSeq/) as well as proteins consisting of an amino acid sequence having 80% or more, preferably 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, identity with an amino acid sequence listed above with the proviso that the protein produces Aβ by cleavage with β-secretase and γ-secretase. The identity of amino acid sequences can be determined by using a sequence analysis software or a conventional program in the field (FASTA, BLAST, etc.).
Moreover, "APP" may encompass proteins consisting of an amino acid sequence having substitution, deletion, insertion, and/or addition of one to several amino acids in an amino acid sequence listed above with proviso that the protein produces Aβ by cleavage with β-secretase and γ-secretase. The "one to several" above is, for example, "1 to 30", preferably "1 to 10", particularly preferably "1 to 5".

A compound or a mixture of two or more selected from the compounds represented by Compounds (I) to (III) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or solvates thereof may be used as an active ingredient of an amyloid fibril formation inhibitor. The amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment may be composed of only the active ingredient, but may usually further include a pharmaceutically acceptable known diluent, carrier, or excipient as an optional component.
The amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment may be produced by formulating one of the compounds represented by Compounds (I) to (III) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or solvates thereof, in combination with one of the known carriers described above as needed, according to a conventional method. In the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor, the one of the compounds represented by Compounds (I) to (III) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or solvates thereof may be contained as an active ingredient in such a range that is suitable for its form and results in an appropriate amount of intake. In the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor, the content of the one of the compounds represented by Compounds (I) to (III) or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof or solvates thereof in the agent is usually preferably determined so that the dose thereof will be 0.001 mg/kg (body weight) or more, preferably 0.01 mg/kg (body weight) or more, for an adult, per day, but it is not limited to such a range and may be adjusted as appropriate depending on symptoms, age, and sex of the patient and the like. The upper limit of the dose is preferably 100 mg/kg (body weight) or less and more preferably 10 mg/kg (body weight) or less per day.
The amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment may be formulated into various dosage forms and examples of such dosage forms include tablets, capsules, granules, powders, syrups, suspensions, suppositories, ointments, creams, gels, patches, inhalants, and injections. Accordingly, the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment may be administered by various modes such as oral administration, intraperitoneal administration, intradermal administration, intravenous administration, intramuscular administration, and intracerebral administration.
When the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor is administered as an oral preparation, it may be formulated into, for example, solid preparations such as tablets, capsules, powders, and granules. In this case, an appropriate additive, for example, an excipient such as starch, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, carboxymethylcellulose, cornstarch, or an inorganic salt and, as desired, a binder, a disintegrator, a lubricant, a colorant, or a flavor may be blended. When the solid preparation is a tablet or a pill, the preparation may be coated with a sugarcoating such as sucrose, gelatin, hydroxypropyl cellulose or a film of a gastrosoluble or enterosoluble substance, as desired. Alternatively, the oral preparation of the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor may be, for example, a solution such as syrup. In this case, sterile water, saline, ethanol, or the like may be used as a carrier. Furthermore, an adjuvant such as a suspending agent, an edulcorant, a flavorant, a preservative, or the like may be added, as desired.
When the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor is formulated into a parenteral preparation, the preparation may be, for example, a solution such as an injection or a preparation for rectal administration. In this case, the preparation may be prepared by dissolving or suspending an active ingredient by a conventional method in a diluent such as distilled water for injection, physiological saline, an aqueous glucose solution, a vegetable oil for injection, sesame oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, corn oil, propylene glycol, polyethyleneglycol; and adding a biocide, a stabilizer, an isotonizing agent, a soothing agent, or the like as needed. It is also possible to produce a solid composition and dissolve the composition in sterile water or a sterile vehicle for injection before use.
The parenteral preparation of the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor may be formulated, for example, as a sustained release preparation such as a microcapsule and may also be administered to the brain directly. The sustained release preparation may be prepared with a carrier that can be prevented from being removed immediately from the body. Examples of preferable carriers that may be used include biodegradable/biocompatible polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyanhydride, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoester, and polylactic acid. Liposomes may be used as a carrier. The liposomes are not particularly limited, but preferable liposomes may be those purified by reverse phase evaporation using a lipid composition containing phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEG-derivatized phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PEG-PE).
Furthermore, the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment may contain a pharmaceutically acceptable additive such as a colorant, a preservative, a flavor, a flavoring agent, and an edulcorant and another therapeutic agent, as desired.
A stabilizer is preferably blended in the formulation of the amyloid fibril formation inhibitor. Examples of the stabilizer may include albumin, globulin, gelatin, mannitol, glucose, dextran, and ethylene glycol.
The amount of the active ingredient contained in the formulation may vary depending on various conditions, for example, the type of the extraction solvent, the amount of the solvent used, and the like. Therefore, an amount of the active ingredient less than the aforementioned preferred amount of intake may be sufficient or an amount exceeding the range may be necessary.
The amyloid fibril formation inhibitor of this embodiment can suppress the formation of the amyloid fibril radically and surely. Therefore it is useful for applications such as treatment or prevention of diseases related to the formation of amyloid fibrils.
According to the second embodiment, the present invention is an amyloid fibril formation inhibitor comprising a compound selected from the group consisting of compounds of compound numbers 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a solvate thereof. The compounds of compound numbers 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 indicated below can inhibit the polymerization of Aβ onto GAβ and suppress the formation of amyloid fibrils.

[Examples]
The present invention is further described by way of Examples below. Such Examples are not intended to limit the present invention.
<1. Screening for compounds that suppress formation of amyloid fibrils>
To find compounds that specifically recognize GAβ and suppress formation of amyloid fibrils, virtual screening with a molecular docking simulation program DOCK4 (http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/) was conducted. For conducting virtual screening, a GAβ complex model was first constructed by molecular dynamics simulation. Structures of sugar chain regions in the GM1 molecule, which are considered to be involved in the binding with Aβ, were optimized based on a molecular orbital calculation, and partial electric charges were assigned for respective atoms. The three-dimensional coordinate data and the values of the partial electric charges of respective atoms in these optimized structures were incorporated into the ff99 parameter set of an empirical force field used in AMBER, and a 5-ns molecular dynamics calculation was conducted in a molecule system in which water molecules were placed. A molecular dynamics calculation of the sugar chain regions in GM1 was conducted and trajectory poses were sampled. Using the obtained trajectory poses, docking with the 3D structure of Aβ40 registered in Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 1AML) was conducted. As a result of the docking, 2,000,000 docking poses were obtained. Among these, docking poses that have little structural distortion and are energetically most stable were extracted and used as an atomic model of GAβ. A 20-ns molecular dynamics calculation was conducted using the above atomic model of GAβ as an initial structure, structure clustering was conducted based on the positional information of the main chain Cα atoms of Aβ, and promising structures for the pocket to which the compound bind were extracted from the obtained representative structures. Meanwhile, compounds that are not preferable in molecular weight or physical property and those that fit certain conditions, such as having a highly reactive substituent, were excluded and a database of 400,000 compounds was constructed. This database was virtually screened by the docking technique using the 3D structure of GAβ obtained as described above. As a result, 321 virtual hit compounds were obtained.
Compounds narrowed down from commercially available compounds as described above were evaluated for their activity to inhibit the GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation in an in vitro reconstituted system described below. As a result, it was suggested that compounds represented by the following general formula (I):a general formula (II):and a general formula (III):were hit compounds of highest preference among a series of hit compounds and have activity to inhibit the GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation. Subsequently, a similarity search for compounds having the inhibitory activity was conducted and the activity to inhibit the GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation was evaluated. As a result, it was revealed that compounds represented by the general formula (I) to (III) have the activity to inhibit the GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation.

<3. Evaluation of the compounds based on the inhibitory activity against amyloid fibril formation in Thioflabin T (ThT) assay>
Inhibitory activity against GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation of the above compounds 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 were evaluated in ThT assay.
(1) Preparation of Aβ solution
Human Aβ1-40 (cat. # 4307-v, prepared by Peptide Institute) was dissolved in a 0.02% ammonia solution (400 µM), and the mixture was treated in an ultracentrifuge (S110AT rotor, Hitachi) at 100,000 rpm for 3 hours. Approximately two-thirds of the upper layer of the supernatant was recovered and protein concentration was measured. The Aβ solution was aliquoted and stored at -80 °C until use, was melted immediately before use, and was diluted to 75 µM using phosphate buffer (PBS: cat. # 10010, manufactured by Life Technologies).
(2) Preparation of GM1-containing liposome
Using a mixed solution of chloroform / methanol (1:1) as a solvent, a mixed solution of 100 mM each of cholesterol and sphingomyelin (both manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared. To this mixed solution, GM 1 (cat. # 1061, manufactured by Matreya Co.) was dissolved to make a solution of 50 mM concentration. This lipid mixed solution was aliquoted into glass test tubes and stored at -20 °C until use, was melted before use, was mixed with chloroform / methanol mixture (1:1) and mixed, and then the solvent was removed by applying nitrogen gas to the suspension. The dried lipid mixture was resuspended in PBS to be a GM1 concentration of 2.5 mM, and frozen and thawed 5 times with liquid nitrogen. The lipid suspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the precipitate was resuspended in PBS to be a GM1 concentration of 2.5 mM. Using an ultrasonic crusher (XL-2000, MISONIX Co., Ltd.) equipped with a microchip, ultrasonic treatment was repeated on ice for 10 seconds until the suspension became transparent, and GM1-containing liposome was prepared. Immediately prior to use, PBS was added and diluted to a GM 1 concentration of 750 µM.
(3) Preparation of compound solution
Compounds 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 were prepared as 10 mM and 2 mM solution in DMSO, respectively. And each solution was diluted to 75 µM or 15 µM with PBS immediately prior to use.
(4) GAβ-dependent amyloid fibril formation
To a 96-well microplate, 5 µl each of the 75 µM Aβ solution prepared above (1), the compound solution prepared in (3) or 0.75% DMSO was mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then, 5 µl each of 750 µM GM1-containing liposome prepared in (2) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for 18 hours.
(5) ThT assay
ThT (manufactured by Sigma-Aldrich) was adjusted to 5 µM using 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5). Immediately before measurement, 10 µl from each well of (4) was transferred to a 96-well black plate. 50 µl of 5 µM ThT solution was added from each injector to each well using a multi-plate reader (ARVO-HTS, manufactured by Perkin Elmer), and then the optimal fluorescence of ThT bound to amyloid fiber (excitation wavelength 430 nm, fluorescence wavelength 490 nm) was measured.
The fluorescence intensity of ThT indicates the degree of amyloid fibrils formation. By calculating the ratio of the ThT fluorescence intensity between addition of the compound and without addition of the compound, the inhibition rate against amyloid fibril formation by the compound was calculated. When the final concentration of the compound was 25 µM, the inhibition rate of less than 40% was evaluated as C, 40% or more and less than 80% were evaluated as B, 80% or more was evaluated as A.
In Table 3, inhibitory activities of compounds 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 against amyloid fibril formation were shown on a scale of A to C. All of the compounds 1 to 133 and 142 to 267 were confirmed to have the inhibitory activities against amyloid fibril formation. In particular, some of the compounds with an A for inhibitory activity (as exemplified by 39, 129, 132, and 133) were identified with having a similar activity to 4396C antibody (Japanese Patent No.4102850), which is an anti- GAβ monoclonal antibody known to specifically recognize GAβ and suppress the amyloid fibril formation.
