T1	REACTION_SPAN 39617 40072	A mixture of 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (6.90 g, 50 mmol), isobutanol (50 mL) and 20% oleum (0.5 mL) was heated at 110° C. for 20 h. The volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. A solution of the residue in ethyl acetate/hexane (1:1, 200 mL) was washed with brine (100 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Obtained isobutyl 3-hydroxybenzoate was directly used in the next step without purification.
T2	REACTION_SPAN 40073 40623	A mixture of the obtained ester, pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (5.82 g, 15 mmol), potassium carbonate (10.35 g, 75 mmol), and DMF (40 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110° C. for 24 h. After cooling, the mixture was poured into ice/water (200 mL) and extracted with hexane/ethyl acetate (200+200 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of the residue (silica gel-hexane/ethyl acetate, 9:1) gave Compound B11, diisobutyl
T3	REACTION_SPAN 40958 41164	Using n-butanol and following the procedure for Compound B11 gave Compound B12, dibutyl 3,3'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((3-(butoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzoate, (5.67 g, 52% yield).
T4	REACTION_SPAN 27228 27234;27235 27919	Step 1 A solution of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrobromide (2.3 g, 5 mmol) in 50 mL of 48% HBr was placed in a 500 mL round bottomed flask, and it was stirred and cooled in an ice-water bath (approx. 0-5° C.). A solution of NaNO2 (5.25 g in 100 mL of water) was added dropwise over a period of 2 h. After the addition, the reaction mixture was kept at 0° C. for an additional 1 h and then removed from the cooling bath and heated at 90-100° C. for 3 h. The mixture was set aside overnight for slow crystallization. The grayish-brown solid was separated, washed with water and dried to give Compound a, 4,8-dibromo-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole), (139 g, 86% yield).
