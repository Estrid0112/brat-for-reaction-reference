FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of decontamination and biocidal agents. More specifically, the invention relates to novel N-halamine melamine derivatives, compositions comprising them, processes for their production, and methods using the same.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
N-halamines are a family of compounds characterized by a halogen-nitrogen bond (FIG. 1), formed by the reaction of amines, amides or imides with halogen, hypohalous acid or hypohalite [1]. The nature of the halogen in these compounds is formally positive, and thus they exhibit oxidative properties, similar to hypohalous acids and salts (e.g. hypochlorite bleach, NaOCl). The most stable compounds are chloramines and bromamines, which have exhibited diverse reactions and have been widely used for research and industry, especially in the field of water treatment and disinfection. Lately, halamines were attached to polymers and textile for potential use as water purification systems (columns, filters) and biocidal coatings. The main advantage of N-halamine filters and coatings is the optional regeneration of the N-Cl bond after oxidation of the substrate, by hypochlorite wash. This regeneration, however, is possible only if the N-Cl is not adjacent to a C-H bond, since elimination might occur, resulting in loss of N-H capable of being chlorinated (FIG. 1). N-Cl bond strength, indirectly proportional to active chlorine release, is different among chloramines derived from amines, amides and imides (FIG. 2).
As oxidative antibacterial agents, N-halamines have been widely-used for sanitation of pools, spas and water reservoirs, and as additives in laundry products and dishwasher detergents, of which examples will follow. However, only few of the halamines have been employed for decontamination of chemical warfare agents (CWAs), specifically sulfur mustard (HD) and VX ([S-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl]-O-ethyl methylphosphonothiolate), which are sensitive to oxidation.
Tetrachlorinated glycolurils have been developed and tested as protection against chemical agents back in the 1950s and 1960s [2], and continue to exhibit interesting results to date, as candidates for sulfur mustard decontamination. A promising candidate, S-330 (FIG. 3), was evaluated as an anti-vesicant additive for a topical skin protectant [3]. Chlorinated hydantoins and imidazolidinones (FIG. 3) were also employed for the decontamination of toxic chemicals, usually evaluated against sulfur mustard simulants [4]. N-chlorosulfonamidates, chloramine-B and chloramine-T, (FIG. 3) were used to oxidize sulfur mustard and VX, as a part of a Soviet personal decontamination kit, adopted later in the American M258 kit. This reaction took place in an aqueous/alcoholic solution containing 5% ZnCl2 to maintain a pH of 5-6 [5]. However, at this low pH, detoxification of G-agents was not efficient. Nowadays, these compounds and their respective dichloramines (a second Cl atom instead of the Na) are used, as a mixture with hexachloromelamine 1 in a Russian decontamination solution for vehicles and terrain. A pool-sanitizing compound, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC, FIG. 3) has been employed in CWA decontamination as the active ingredient of various products (Cristanini's BX-24, OWR's 10% NaDCC aqueous solution for terrain decontamination, OWR's BC emulsion and CASCAD). In contrast to former N-halamines, NaDCC is used specifically for terrain rather than personal decontamination [6].
Lately, a comprehensive review of halamines and their applications has been published [7]. Most of the current synthetic efforts in the N-halamine field have been directed at the attachment of N-halamines to insoluble polymers, thus obtaining antibacterial fabrics, active resins, filters and columns suitable for antibacterial water treatment. Decontamination of CWAs and simulants was also addressed by polymeric N-halamines, preferably hydantoins (FIG. 3) attached to fabrics. These studies include grafting of hydantoin monomers on synthetic fibers [8], direct attachment of hydantoin methylols on cotton or cotton/polyester [9] or attachment of hydantoins to cotton via a siloxane bond [10]. Notwithstanding, the majority of polymeric N-halamine products address bacteria and other biological hazards, rather than deal with chemical agent decontamination.
Current decontaminating agents focus on treating the CWA available for decontamination, such as visible droplets on contaminated surfaces. However, a substantial amount of CWA penetrates polymeric surfaces within a short while post contamination (˜30-40% in 30 min). This fraction is not available for destruction by current (mostly aqueous) decontamination agents. Hence, the contaminated polymeric surfaces pose a long-term hazard. Therefore, there is currently a need for novel efficient decontamination agents for CWA and/or biological agent absorbed into polymeric matrices such as paint, coatings, and plastics.
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel chemical compounds capable of overcoming the drawbacks of existing decontamination and biocidal agents, and which can be incorporated into polymeric matrices to provide self-decontaminating surfaces. The self-decontaminating surfaces of the invention are capable of both efficiently deactivating any CWA and neutralizing any biological agent which penetrates the surface after exposure.
It is another object of the invention to provide novel decontamination agents that may be advantageously used as additives in various chemical compositions.
It is a further object of the invention to provide processes for manufacturing novel compounds active as decontamination and biocidal agents as well as methods of using the same.
Further purposes and advantages of this invention will appear as the description proceeds.

The following examples, which further describe the invention, are offered by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner.
Example 1
Chlorinated Melamine
Melamine, 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triamine is an organic base, with vast use, in combination with formaldehyde, as melamine resin in the plastic industry. Melamine has been found particularly advantageous since the amine groups, of guanidine nature, may also serve as handles for attachment to commercial polymers or polymerizable moieties. Moreover, melamine contains three amines that could be converted into 1 to 6 active N-Cl groups. Full chlorination of melamine was carried out by 5% hypochlorite bleach in slightly acidic to neutral pH. Resulting hexachloromelamine (1) served as a chlorinating agent for further reactions. Partially chlorinated melamines 2, 3 and 4 were obtained by disproportionation of chlorine atoms, when hexachloromelamine was mixed and heated with various ratios of melamine (Scheme 1)[11]. These partially chlorinated melamines were used for further conjugation of the melamine moiety.

Example 2
Melamine Polymethacrylate Derivatives
As a rule, effective CWA decontamination is achieved by large quantities of decontaminant, as compared to the toxic agent. Hence, the preparation of melamine-based polymers, where most of the amine moieties remain available for subsequent chlorination might afford a highly reactive polymer. Another requirement of these polymers was to sustain their ability for regeneration (no a-hydrogen atoms). To accommodate these requirements, we designed a methacryloyl-melamine monomer, where a single polymerization handle is attached via an amide bond to one of the melamine amine groups, while the other two remain free (scheme 2). In a similar manner, more than one methacrylate group may be attached, to form cross-linked polymers.
Acylation of melamine is usually carried out by prolonged heating with the desired acid anhydride or amide, while acid halides seem to have little or no effect on melamine [12]. The use of high temperatures (170-200° C.), combined with large amounts of acid derivatives (usually serving as solvents), gives rise to di- and tri-amides of melamine in many cases [13].
A more recent work described the preparation of melamine amides directly from halogenated melamines. In comparison to standard amide formation, where an acid chloride reacts with an amine to form an amide while releasing HCl, the proposed reaction between an acid halide and chloromelamine forms the desired amide while releasing Cl, (scheme 2) [14]. Although this work dealt with the formation of tris amides and tris carbamates, the relatively mild conditions (75° C., 3 h) prompted us to attempt monoamidation by the reaction of monochloromelamine 4 with methacryloyl chloride, to form the desired monomer.
<img> id-US20180105618A1-20180419-C00009.TIF </img>
The reaction of 4 with one equivalent of methacryloyl chloride in CCI, resulted in partial polymerization of the desired monomer. This could be explained by the release of chlorine radicals in the reaction mixture, upon formation of the amide. These radicals initiated the polymerization process (scheme 3). To verify this, the reaction was repeated in methacryloyl chloride as solvent, for 18 h. The resulting precipitate was proven to consist of methacrylic polymer bearing melamine groups. Thus, in one step, both amidation and polymerization were performed. Due to the fact that this polymerization took place in methacryloyl chloride, the product was a copolymer of melamine methacrylamide and methacryloyl chloride 5.
Copolymer 5 was subjected to chlorination by dilute hypochlorite bleach in slightly acidic pH (5-6). As a result, the amine groups were chlorinated and the acid chloride underwent hydrolysis to the corresponding acid. The chlorinated copolymer 6 was identified by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR-ATR and gave a positive result when placed on a KI-starch paper (strong purple stain). As a rule, melamines, and especially polymelamines, are rather insoluble and could be evaluated in NMR only in DMSO-d6. However, all chlorinated melamines, monomers or polymers alike, exhibited violent exothermic reaction to DMSO-d6 and thus, NMR spectra of the chlorinated molecules could be run only in pyridine-d5.

The same conditions were used to prepare a cross-linked polymer based on melamine and methacrylate. In this case, diamidation, followed by polymerization was carried out on dichloromelamine 3, to afford chains of polymethacrylic acid linked by melamine moieties 7, which were later chlorinated to give 8 (scheme 4).
A similar reaction, carried out on trichloromelamine 2, afforded the highly cross-linked polymer 9, which was subsequently chlorinated by hypochlorite bleach in the usual manner to give polymer 10 (scheme 4).
<img> id-US20180105618A1-20180419-C00011.TIF </img>
In order to study the influence of melamine groups on polymer decontaminating activity, a similar polymer was prepared, based on methacrylamide, whose amide groups were subsequently chlorinated in the same manner (11, scheme 5).

Example 3
Polyurea Melamine
The general reaction of acid halides with chloromelamines (described in scheme 2) was utilized in the preparation of a novel family of melamine polymers, containing carbonyl groups as linkers between any two melamine moieties. Triphosgene (a stable substitute to phosgene) was reacted with dichloromelamine 3 or trichloromelamine 2 to form a chain polyurea-melamine 12 or branched polyurea-melamine 14, respectively (scheme 6). These polymers were subsequently chlorinated by the usual method to form polymers 13 and 15. These polymers contain a large amount of chlorinated melamines per weight, as compared to the polymethacrylate derivatives, due to the small carbonyl linker.

Example 4
Bis-melamine Derivatives
In general, bismelamines bearing two melamine moieties were prepared by reacting diacid chlorides with two equivalents of monochloromelamine 4, as described before. Among these diacid chlorides: adipoyl dichloride (resulting in bismelamine amide 16 and chlorinated bismelamine amide 17, scheme 7) and two carboxyl chloride-terminated PEGs (resulting in bismelamine carbamates 18 and 19, and chlorinated carbamates 20 and 21, scheme 8). Polymers based on these bismelamines were prepared by the reaction of the diacid chlorides with dichloromelamine 3 (Scheme 9).

Example 5
Tris-melamine Derivatives
A small molecule bearing three melamine moieties was prepared from 1,3,5-tricarbonyl trichloride benzene, which was reacted in the usual manner with three equivalents of monochloromelamine 4. 1,3,5-tricarbonyl trismelamineamide 26 was subsequently converted to the chlorinated form 27 by treating with hypochlorite bleach at pH=5 (Scheme 10).

Example 6
Hexakismelamine
Hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene was used as a starting material to prepare a small molecule with six melamine groups attached to a cyclophosphazene core. The typical procedure that we carried out during this work, namely the reaction of acid chloride with monochloromelamine to form the amide, proved less successful in the case of phosphazene chloride. A maximum of four melamine groups were attached to the core in this reaction. This result repeated itself upon changing solvents, increasing the reaction temperature and duration, and even upon the addition of base.
Finally, the desired hexakismelamine cyclotriphosphazene was prepared by the rather facile reaction of hexachlorocyclotriphosphazene with six equivalents of melamine in boiling water (Scheme 11). Increase in reaction time or starting material concentration resulted in formation of cyclophosphazene-melamine polymers. Unfortunately, the desired product 28 could not be chlorinated, since, under the reaction conditions, the cyclotriphosphazene core collapsed.

A small molecule bearing six melamine moieties was prepared from mellitic acid, which was initially converted into hexa acid chloride with PCl5, and was then reacted in the usual manner with six equivalents of monochloromelamine 4. Benzene hexakismelamineamide 29 was subsequently converted to the chlorinated form 30 by treating with hypochlorite bleach at pH=5 (Scheme 12).

Decontamination of Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs)
Caution: These experiments should only be performed by trained personnel using applicable safety procedures. Some of the decontamination reactions are violent and exothermic.
Decontamination of CWAs by melamine halamines was usually evaluated by solid state magic angle spinning (MAS) 31P or 13C NMR. The halamines were tested against sulfur mustard (HD) and VX (O-ethyl-S-2-(N,N-diisopropylamino)ethyl methylphosphonate), which are susceptible to oxidation. In a typical test [16], the melamine halamine powder (ca. 40 mg) was used to fill a 4-mm ZrO2 rotor. Next, VX or 13C-labeled HD [17] (2-3 mg, 5-6.5%) were applied directly to the center of the sample. The rotor was sealed with a fitted Kel-F cap. 31P (for VX) or 13C (for HD) MAS NMR experiments were carried out on a 500 MHz Avance (Bruker) spectrometer equipped with a 4-mm standard CP-MAS probe using direct excitation (no CP). The observation frequency was 202 MHz (31P) and 125 MHz (13C). Remaining CWA quantity and decontamination products were determined.
In cases where decontamination reactions were violent, the reaction was carried out in a regular glass tube, and after the reaction was over (complete termination of fumes), the contents were extracted with MeOH-d4, filtered, transferred to an NMR tube and analyzed. Table 2 describes decontamination efficacy (%) and time.

As expected, the major decontamination product for VX was the non-toxic product ethyl methylphosphonic acid (EMPA). For sulfur mustard, decontamination products usually include hydrolysis products, such as thiodiglycol (TDG), oxidation products, such as sulfur mustard sulfoxide or sulfone, or elimination products, such as divinyl sulfide (DVS) [16]. However, analyzing decontamination products of the reaction between halamines and sulfur mustard revealed that, in this case, a different mechanism takes place and multi-chlorinated compounds are produced (Scheme 13). As we found out, in the case of no evident violent reaction, oxidation to the sulfoxide occurs as the initial step, followed by excess chlorination takes place mainly on the a methylene (adjacent to the sulfoxide). When a violent reaction is evident, no oxidation happens, and excess chlorination occurs on the terminal methylene (adjacent to the existing chlorine atom). The difference in chlorination sites are attributed to shifting acidities of the methylene hydrogens, during the oxidation of sulfide to sulfoxide. These findings are consistent with the limited information given in the literature [18].

Example 9
Decontamination of Biological Agents
Halamines are well known in their capacity to efficiently kill bacteria. Nevertheless, since the melamine-derived halamines are novel compounds, we tested two of them against bacteria, to ascertain that they exhibit the same behavior. Later, we tested all new melamine halamines against Bacillus anthracis, as a worst-case screen. In the first test, chlorinated and non-chlorinated polymers 6 and 13 (10 ppm each) were tested against E. coli ATCC 25922 (2.9×106 CFU) and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (1.9×106 CFU). Non-chlorinated polymers gave no effect at all, while both chlorinated polymers showed 6-log kill within 5 minutes (FIGS. 4A and 4B).
Since these model compounds showed strong activity against bacteria, Bacillus anthracis, a more robust challenge was used for the screening of novel melamine-derived halamines. The initial test comprised of reacting 4×106 spores with 10 or 100 ppm of tested halamines. Most of the halamines at 100 ppm concentration exhibited 6-log kill after 1 hour, and 5-log kill within 30 minutes (FIGS. 5A and 5B).
The efficacy of halamines to decontaminate Bacillus spores was presented previously only once. A group at the University of California at Davis, in collaboration with the HaloSource company showed that Bacillus subtilis (an anthrax surrogate) was placed on textiles treated with hydantoin-derived halamine (FIG. 3). The percent reduction in live spores was around 100% in 48 hours, depending on the fabric used [19].
It is noteworthy that compound 11 is derived from commercial poly methacrylamide and does not contain a melamine moiety. It was tested as a negative control, since it did not exhibit good decontaminating results against sulfur mustard or VX.
While the invention has been described using some specific examples, many modifications and variations are possible. It is therefore understood that the invention is not intended to be limited in any way, other than by the scope of the appended claims.
Example 10
N-halamine Melamine Coated/Bound Nanoparticles
This family is based on commercial functionalized silica or synthesized silica nanoparticles. The melamine moieties are either covalently bound to a functional group on the silica core, or serves as a coating of the silica core. These silicone-based melamine halamines are suited to be incorporated into surfaces (e.g. polymeric sheets, silicone products) or may be used as coatings. Some examples are described in the following schemes:

Example 11
Biocidal Efficacy Test for Melamine-Halamine Containing Paint
Test samples were prepared by first preparing melamine-halamine containing paints: 4 mL matt polyurethane paint was mixed with 0.25 mL thinner containing varying amounts (2-5%) of various chlorinated melamine-halamine compounds (compounds 13, 25 or 27, see table below). Transparency sheets were painted with original and melamine-halamine containing paint and following drying, they were cut into 2.5×2.5 cm rectangles. Original paint samples and melamine-halamine paint samples were challenged with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922). A “sandwich test” was employed to evaluate the efficacies of the chlorinated samples. For a typical test, 25 μL of the bacterial suspension was placed in the center of a sample in a sterile Petri dish and covered with a second identical size of sample. After contact times of 30, 60, and 120 min, the samples were placed (back to back) in sterile conical centrifuge tubes containing 5.0 mL of a 0.02 N sodium thiosulfate solution to quench any oxidative chlorine and vortexed for 2 min. The samples were then removed, and the quenched solution was diluted serially with 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7 (10−1, 10−2, 10−3). Then, 4 drops of 10 μL of original and each diluted solution were placed on a BHIA plate. The plates were incubated at 37° C. for 24 h, and then bacterial colonies were counted for further analysis.
