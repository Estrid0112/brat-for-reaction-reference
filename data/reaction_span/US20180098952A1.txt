BACKGROUND
The field of the invention relates to compounds that selectively inactivate and/or inhibit Toxoplasma gondii ornithine aminotransferase (TgOAT). In particular, the field of the invention relates to selective inactivators and/or inhibitors of TgOAT for the treatment for the treatment of infection associated with Toxoplasma gondii and/or Plasmodium falciparum.
Toxoplasmosis, the disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), is the leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illness in the United States. It is estimated that this parasite infects between 30 and 50% of the world population. One potential therapeutic target in the fight against this parasite is ornithine aminotransferase (TgOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in preventing toxic accumulation of ornithine in the cell. A selective inhibition of OAT in T. gondii over human OAT is highly desired in either eliminating the growth of the parasites or preventing the shedding of long lived and persisting infectious oocysts into the environment. We have characterized a number of features of TgOAT: the gene, protein, abundance in different life cycle stages, and enzyme activity. A screening of our library of 23 GABA analogues resulted in several selective inactivators of TgOAT. Crystal structures of the native and inactivated enzymes were obtained. Two different inactivation mechanisms of two different inactivators were identified: one by gabaculine, which inactivated the enzyme by forming an aromatic ring inside the active site, which created a large energy barrier to reversal and put the product in a deep thermodynamic well, and the other by (S)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid, which inactivated the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct to the enzyme. These newly identified TgOAT inactivators and insights of the enzyme binding pocket from crystal structures lay a foundation of further studies of selective inactivation of TgOAT and drug development.

Selective Inactivators of Apicomplexan Ornithine Aminotransferase
The technology of this application relates to selective inactivators of apicomplexan ornithine aminotransferases and has numerous applications, including but not limited to: (i) developing treatments for toxoplasmosis and malaria; (ii) discovering new compounds for studying inactivation of Toxoplasma gondii ornithine aminotransferase for further drug development.
The Apicomplexan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Toxoplasmosis, the disease caused by T. gondii, is the leading cause of death attributed to foodborne illness in the United States. Globally, this parasite infects between 30 and 50% of the population. This means that approximately two billion people have this parasite living within their brains, with largely unknown consequences. Comprising a public health threat, toxoplasmosis could result in a wide range of serious health problems, including blindness and neurological disease in congenital infection and severe meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised persons. The parasite P. falciparum also causes significant human suffering. In 2013, there were 584,000 deaths, with 78% occurring in children younger than 5 years of age. Like the cat vector for Toxoplasma, the malaria vector, the Anopheles mosquito, transmits a disease that remains a substantial threat to human health.
Current therapeutics for T. gondii and P. falciparum have limitations, including toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, an inability to eliminate the latent, encysted bradyzoite life stage of T. gondii, and drug resistance of malaria. For these reasons, new therapeutic approaches are needed.
One molecular target has been identified on the basis of several characteristics, including computed druggability, phylogenetic data, assayability, and potential of structure determination: the mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). OAT is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of L-ornithine to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde, which spontaneously cyclizes to form Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate. One main role of OAT is to prevent toxic accumulation of ornithine in the cell. In human, a deficiency of OAT is known to cause gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, but high levels of the enzyme impair the detoxification of ammonia by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, through the urea cycle. A selective inhibition of T. gondii OAT and P. falciparum OAT over human OAT would potentially lead to a toxic accumulation of ornithine only in the parasites.
While human OAT has been well studied and characterized, and has demonstrated to be a high therapeutic target, our knowledge of T. gondii OAT and P. falciparum OAT is severely limited, with the current understanding being based on parallels to other species. While the kinetic and crystallographic analysis of PfOAT was characterized previously, TgOAT has not been characterized, structurally or functionally, or studied for its potential as a molecular target in this parasite. No selective inhibitors of TgOAT had been identified to target any of the parasite life cycle stages. It has been known that expression of TgOAT was ˜256 times higher in sporozoites than in tachyzoites and bradyzoites; therefore, even if this molecular target was not critical for tachyzoites or bradyzoites, targeting the formation of the environmentally-resistant oocyst life cycle stage could have a significant impact on disrupting the chain of transmission and, thereby, decrease the consequent morbidity and mortality.
We have identified for the first time several selective irreversible inhibitors, a.k.a. inactivators, of TgOAT that could be used for studying selective inactivation of TgOAT for further drug development. We also characterized a number of features of TgOAT: the gene, protein, abundance in different life cycle stages, and enzyme activity We obtained the crystal structure of the native TgOAT and the crystal structures of two different types of inactivated TgOAT: one by gabaculine, which inactivated the enzyme by forming an aromatic ring inside the active site, which created a large energy barrier to reversal and put the product in a deep thermodynamic well, and the other by (S)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid, which inactivated the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct to the enzyme.

Title: 4-Amino-5-Fluorohexanoic Acid Inhibitors of Ornithine Aminotransferase
Reference is made to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/787,409, entitled “4-Amino-Fluorohexanoic Acid Inhibitors of Ornithine Aminotransferase,” filed on Mar. 15, 2013, now expired (hereinafter “the '409 Provisional Application”), which content is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

This example relates to compound of a formula:
and salts, hydrates, and solvates thereof.
In certain embodiments, such a compound may be selected from:
Regardless, the compounds of this example are without stereochemical limitation. As illustrated and discussed below, such compounds and/or their intermediates are available as single enantiomers, racemic mixtures from which isomers can be resolved, or diastereomers from which the corresponding enantiomers can be separated. Accordingly, any stereocenter can be (S) or (R) with respect to any other stereocenter(s). As a separate consideration, various compounds can be present as an acid salt, either partially or fully protonated. In certain such embodiments, the counterion(s) can be a conjugate base of a protic acid. Further, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that any one or more the compounds of this invention can be provided as part of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier component for use in conjunction with a treatment method or medicament.
In part, the present invention can also be directed to a method inhibiting an ornithine aminotransferase. Such a method can comprise providing a compound of this invention, whether or not part of a pharmaceutical composition, and administering an effective amount of such a compound for contact with an ornithine aminotransferase, such as an ornithine aminotransferase of a Apicomplexan parasite (e.g., ornithine aminotransferase of Toxoplasma gondii (TgOAT) or Plasmodium falciparum (PfOAT).
Inhibitors of aminotransferases are known in the art. For example, Vigabatrin 2 (i.e., 4-aminohex-5-enoic acid) is known to inhibit γ-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), which catalyzes the transformation of GABA into succinic semialdehyde. Inhibition of GABA-AT by vigabatrin has been shown to involve two distinct mechanisms (Scheme 1).
As indicated in Scheme 1, after the formation of a Schiff base between the drug and the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), Lys329 (the previous anchor point for the aldehyde) deprotonates the γ-proton, and tautomerizes the complex in two ways (pathways a and b). Pathway “a” creates a Michael acceptor moiety in the substrate (3); Lys329 undergoes 1,4-addition to give 4. Pathway “b” involves tautomerization through the alkene, leading to enamine adduct 5, which releases enamine 6 that reattaches to the PLP to give 7. The observed products of the reaction were determined to be in the ratio of ˜75% for the Michael addition pathway and ˜%25 for the enamine pathway.
5-Fluoro-4-aminopentanoic acid 8 has long been known as a very efficient inactivator of GABA-AT that inhibits the enzyme exclusively through a mechanism (Scheme 2, R═H) that involves Schiff base formation with pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) followed by elimination of HF to 9 (R═H), leading only to the enamine pathway (10, R═H).
In view of this mechanism outlined in Scheme 2, 11 and 12 were synthesized, where 11 and 12 are identical to 8 except for the addition of a gem-methyl group on the carbon with the fluorine atom. However, elimination of HF from 11 or 12 would lead to an identical enamine intermediate (5, Scheme 1) found by tautomerization of 2. If so, then 11 or 12 would be a vigabatrin mimic that proceeds exclusively by vigabatrin's minor enamine pathway (pathway b, Scheme 1). This is depicted in Scheme 2, where R═CH3 (compare 9, R═CH3 to 5 in Scheme 1).
Off-target effects of 8 are significant, especially at glutamate decarboxylase (GAD, required for GABA synthesis) and, to a lesser extent, at aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT). Vigabatrin (2), which is based on a hexanoic acid skeleton, shows no activity at GAD and weakly affects Asp-AT. It was, therefore, thought that hexanoic acids 11 and/or 12 could be not only inactivators of GABA-AT, but also of OAT-while displaying improved enzyme selectivity when compared to their shorter chain analogue 8.
The devised synthetic route was based around the asymmetric dihydroxylation/lactonization of a hexenoate ester and involved the use of azide as a nitrogen source, as well as a benzyl ester as a carboxylate protecting group. These choices were made to simplify the isolation and purification of the zwitterion after the final hydrogenolysis; under these conditions, only simple recrystallization was required instead of ion exchange chromatography (Scheme 3).
The synthesis of (S,S)-11, (R,R)-11, and 12, started with the Claisen-Johnson rearrangement of 3-buten-2-ol (13) and triethyl orthoacetate. The continuous removal of ethanol during this reaction, which was reported to result in good yields, led to the formation of product 14 along with its corresponding 3-buten-2-ol ester; however, this mixture was difficult to separate, and yields were low as a result.
Asymmetric dihydroxylation/lactonization of unsaturated ester 14 led to hydroxyethyl butenolide (R,R)-15, the key intermediate of this synthesis. Fluorination of this compound using XtalFluor E® ((diethylamino)difluorosulfonium tetrafluoroborate) and DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene) yielded intermediate (R,S)-16, which was hydrolyzed under basic conditions and esterified to give acyclic fluorinated alcohol (R,S)-17.
The hydroxyl group in (R,S)-17 was replaced by azide under Mitsunobu conditions using DPPA (diphenylphosphoryl azide) and DIAD (diisopropyl azodicarboxylate), and the resulting azide (S,S)-18 was hydrogenated to give final compound (S,S)-11. The chiral purity of the product was determined by derivatization as the Mosher amide, and was found to have 92% ee.
Compound (R,R)-11 was obtained in a manner similar to that of its enantiomer, but using AD-Mix α instead of its counterpart, and DAST (diethylaminosulfurtrifluoride) instead of XtalFluor E® for the fluorination step.
The synthesis of compound 12 was initially attempted through the double inversion of ent-17 to give 23. However, with prospects for a better result, efforts were shifted toward the inversion of (R,R)-15 via a Mitsunobu protocol. Although the reaction with picolinic acid was not productive, the use of 4-nitrobenzoic acid was successful.
After subjecting diester 19 to literature conditions designed to obtain butenolide 20 exclusively (free from the competing tetrahydropyrone product), only the desired product was obtained in a good yield. Fluorination of this compound led to 21, and the synthesis was completed as before (Scheme 3).
The enantiomer of 12 was not synthesized because it is known that active GABA compounds of this type have S stereo chemistry at the amine carbon. Therefore, while available through the strategy outlined above, the R isomer was not a particularly attractive synthetic target to warrant additional effort.

Synthetic Procedures and Characterization
(E)-Ethyl hex-4-enoate (14). Neat propionic acid (126.2 μL, 125.2 mg, 1.681 mmol) was added to a mixture of 3-buten-2-ol (25.00 g, 336.3 mmol) and triethyl orthoacetate (100 mL, 86.73 g, 534.6 mmol) in a 3-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser over a liquid addition funnel. The magnetically stirred solution was heated to 135° C. under nitrogen. Every 2 h, the funnel was closed and a sample of the condensate was analyzed by NMR. When no more starting alcohol was found in the distillate, the reaction was brought to room temperature and water (30 mL) was added. Stirring was continued for 30 min, and the low-boiling components were distilled off with minimal vacuum, using an additional 30 mL ethanol to remove residual water. Then, a higher vacuum was applied to distill the product. Column chromatography (20% dichloromethane in hexanes) led to the product (21.535 g, 151.44 mmol, 45%) as a clear, volatile liquid, and significant amounts of 3-buten-2-yl hex-4-enoate as a side product (yield not determined).

The flask was flushed under vacuum and filled with hydrogen three times. A hydrogen-filled balloon was fitted to the sealed flask through a needle, and stirring was continued for 24 hat room temperature. At that time, the suspension was filtered through a pad of Celite with additional methanol (50 mL). Solvent and volatiles were removed from the filtrate under high vacuum.

Synthesis Schemes. Synthesis of IV-10 (Scheme 4) began with commercially available 3-nitro-4-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid (IV-23). Esterification followed by catalytic hydrogenation provided methyl aminobenzoate IV-24. Installation of the nitrile was achieved via Sandmeyer reaction; however, obtaining an adequate and reproducible yield was difficult. A number of different reagents and conditions for this reaction were explored; most employing some form of copper (I), typically copper (I) cyanide. It was ultimately found, however, that a moderate yield could be reliably obtained by using copper (II) sulfate and potassium cyanide. The synthesis then proceeded with reduction and Boc protection of the nitrile to yield IV-26. Saponification of the ester followed by Boc deprotection of IV-27 gave the desired amino acid product (IV-10) as the hydrochloride salt.
The synthesis of IV-11 also started with IV-23 and is shown in Scheme 5. After first performing an Arndt-Eistert homologation, the synthesis followed a route similar to the one used to generate IV-10. An effort was made to improve the yield of the homologation; however, yields remained consistently around 50%. Both TMSCHN2 and freshly generated and distilled CH2N2 were evaluated, in addition to various reactions times, temperatures, and silver catalyst sources, but no significant improvement was observed.
The synthesis of IV-12 (Scheme 6) was initially planned to follow a route similar to that of IV-10 and IV-11; however, it was found that attempting the homologation reaction after installation of the nitrile resulted in significantly lower yields, many side products, and loss of starting material. It is believed that the nitrile is labile under the acidic reaction conditions generated during formation of the acyl chloride intermediate. To circumvent this problem, amine IV-34 was substituted first with a bromide rather than a nitrile, then carried through the homologation to generate ester IV-37. Microwave assisted cyanation provided the desired nitrile (IV-38), which was then reduced and Boc protected to give IV-39. After ester hydrolysis, deprotection of the Boc group using 6 N HCl was attempted; however, formation of the lactam over the amino acid salt appeared to be more favorable under these conditions and was difficult to separate from the desired product. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was instead used for the deprotection resulting in the desired product (IV-12) as the TFA salt.
General Methods. Compounds IV-23 and IV-33 were purchased from Matrix Scientific. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company. All reagents were used as received. All syntheses were conducted under anhydrous conditions in an atmosphere of argon, using flame-dried apparatus and employing standard techniques in handling air-sensitive materials, unless otherwise noted. All solvents were distilled and stored under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere before use. Analytical thin layer chromatography was visualized by ultraviolet light. Flash column chromatography was carried out under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Reactions utilizing microwave irradiation were performed using a Biotage Initiator Microwave Synthesizer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker AVANCE III 500 spectrometer. 19F NMR spectra were obtained with an Agilent DDR2 400 MHz spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500 MHz and are presented as follows: chemical shift (in ppm on the δ scale relative to δ=7.26 or 3.31 ppm for the solvent residual peaks in CDCl3 or MeOD, respectively), integration, multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet, br=broad), coupling constant (J/Hz). Coupling constants were taken directly from the spectra and are uncorrected. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 126 MHz, and are presented as follows: chemical shift (in ppm on the δ scale relative to δ=77.16 or 49.00 ppm for the solvent residual peaks in CDCl3 or MeOD, respectively), multiplicity, coupling constant (J/Hz). 19F NMR spectra were recorded at 376 MHz, and are presented as follows: chemical shift (in ppm on the δ scale relative to δ=0.00 ppm for the external standard peak of CFCl3), multiplicity, coupling constant (J/Hz). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured with an Agilent 6210 LC-TOF (ESI, APCI, APPI) mass spectrometer. The purity of the synthesized final compounds was determined by HPLC analysis to be ≥95%. The column used was a Phenomenex Luna 5 μm 200 Å, 4.6×250 mm. The column was thoroughly equilibrated at 100% solvent A, minimum 5 volumes. The compounds were eluted with a gradient from solvent A (90:10, CH3CN: 50 mM NH4OAc pH 5.8) to solvent B (50:50, CH3CN: 10 mM NH4OAc pH 5.8), 0-2.5 min, 0% B isocratic; 2.5-10 min, 0-100% B; 10-20 min, 100% B isocratic. Biochemical assays were performed using a Biotek Synergy H1 microplate reader. Prior to their evaluation, initial experiments were performed to confirm the synthesized analogues do not inhibit the coupling enzymes utilized in the substrate and inhibition assays.

Abstract
Toxoplasmosis, the disease caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), is the leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illness in the United States. It is estimated that this parasite infects between 30 and 50% of the world population. One potential therapeutic target in the fight against this parasite is ornithine aminotransferase (TgOAT), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that plays a crucial role in preventing toxic accumulation of ornithine in the cell. A selective inhibition of OAT in T. gondii over human OAT is highly desired in either eliminating the growth of the parasites or preventing the shedding of infectious oocysts into the environment. We have characterized a number of features of TgOAT: the gene, protein, abundance in different life cycle stages, and enzyme activity. A screening of our library of 23 GABA analogues resulted in several selective inactivators of TgOAT. Crystal structures of the native and inactivated enzymes were obtained. Two different inactivation mechanisms of two different inactivators were identified: one by gabaculine, which inactivated the enzyme by forming an aromatic ring inside the active site, which created a large energy barrier to reversal and put the product in a deep thermodynamic well, and the other by (S)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid, which inactivated the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct to the enzyme. These newly identified TgOAT inactivators and insights of the enzyme binding pocket from crystal structures lay a foundation of further studies of selective inactivation of TgOAT and drug development.
Introduction
The Apicomplexan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.1 Toxoplasmosis, the disease caused by T. gondii, is the leading cause of death attributed to food-borne illness in the United States.1 Globally, this parasite infects between 30 and 50% of the population.2 This means that approximately two billion people have this parasite living within their brains, with largely unknown consequences. There are three life cycle stages of T. gondii: tachyzoites are the active form that destroy tissues during acute infections; bradyzoites are the dormant form that encyst and remain a source of recrudescent infection; and sporozoites, formed in the cat intestine, are widely disseminated in nature. Infection with T. gondii typically occurs via inadvertent ingestion of infectious oocysts in food or water contaminated by cat excrement.3 Indeed, it has been estimated that the number of infectious oocysts per square foot of soil in the U.S. ranges from 9 to 434.4 The ingestion of a single oocyst is capable of inducing infection and they persist in warm, moist soil or water for up to a year.5-7 Comprising a public health threat, toxoplasmosis results in a wide range of serious health problems, including blindness and neurological disease in congenital infection and severe meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised persons.8-11 The parasite P. falciparum also causes significant human suffering. In 2013, there were 584,000 deaths, with 78% occurring in children younger than 5 years of age.12 Like the cat vector for Toxoplasma, the malaria vector, the Anopheles mosquito, transmits a disease that remains a substantial threat to human health. Current therapeutics for T. gondii and P. falciparum have limitations, including toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, an inability to eliminate the latent, encysted bradyzoite life stage of T. gondii, and drug resistance of malaria.13-17 For these reasons, new therapeutic approaches are needed.
To address this important issue, a variety of molecular targets have been identified on the basis of several characteristics, including computed druggability, phylogenetic data, assayability, and potential of structure determination.18,19 One such target was chosen for its role in the metabolism of arginine and ornithine, as well as in amino acid biosynthesis; this is the mitochondrial matrix enzyme ornithine aminotransferase (OAT). OAT is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of L-ornithine to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde, which spontaneously cyclizes to form Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (FIG. 1).20 In this first half of the catalytic cycle, the cofactor PLP is converted to pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate (PMP). In the second half of its catalytic cycle, OAT also converts α-ketoglutarate from the Krebs cycle to L-glutamate and returns PMP to PLP. One main role of OAT is to prevent toxic accumulation of ornithine in the cell. In human, a deficiency of OAT is known to cause gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina, but high levels of the enzyme impair the detoxification of ammonia by ornithine carbamoyltransferase, through the urea cycle.20 A selective inhibition of TgOAT and PfOAT over human OAT would potentially lead to a toxic accumulation of ornithine only in the parasites.
While human OAT has been well studied and characterized, and has demonstrated to be a high therapeutic target,20-22 our knowledge of T. gondii OAT and P. falciparum OAT is severely limited, with the current understanding being based on parallels to other species. While the kinetic and crystallographic analysis of PfOAT was characterized previously,23,24 TgOAT has not been characterized, structurally or functionally, or studied for its potential as a molecular target in this parasite. No selective inhibitors of TgOAT had been identified to target any of the parasite life cycle stages. It has been known that expression of TgOAT was ˜256 times higher in sporozoites than in tachyzoites and bradyzoites; therefore, even if this molecular target was not critical for tachyzoites or bradyzoites, targeting the formation of the environmentally-resistant oocyst life cycle stage could have a significant impact on disrupting the chain of transmission and, thereby, decrease the consequent morbidity and mortality. We have identified for the first time several selective irreversible inhibitors, a.k.a. inactivators, of TgOAT that could be used for studying selective inactivation of TgOAT for further drug development. We also characterized a number of features of TgOAT: the gene, protein, abundance in different life cycle stages, and enzyme activity. We obtained the crystal structure of the native TgOAT and the crystal structures of two different types of inactivated TgOAT: one by gabaculine, which inactivated the enzyme by forming an aromatic ring inside the active site, which created a large energy barrier to reversal and put the product in a deep thermodynamic well, and the other by (S)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid, 18 (FIG. 3), which inactivated the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct to the enzyme.
Materials and Methods
Target Selection. Ornithine aminotransferase was initially deposited into and selected from the Tropical Disease Resource (TDR) Targets Database, by Agüero and colleagues in 2008.18,19 It was selected by the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Disease at Northwestern University for further study on the basis of its documented importance to several key metabolic pathways, including the molecular processing of ornithine in the urea cycle and the role of ornithine in the polyamine pathway, and the predicted feasibility of solution of its secondary structure.
Multi-Sequence Alignment of Ornithine Aminotransferase. An amino acid sequence alignment performed with Clustal Omega was used to determine degree of conservation of OAT across species.25 TgOAT was compared with homologues from close evolutionary relatives like Hammondia hammondi and Neospora caninum, another Apicomplexan parasite, P. falciparum, and the vertebrates, Felis catus, and Homo sapiens. Accession numbers include T. gondii (XP_002365604.1), H. hammondi (XP_008882303.1), N. caninum (XP_003883978.1), P. falciparum (CAG25330.1), F. catus (XP_003994548.1), and H. sapiens (AAA59957.1). Structures of H. sapiens (PDB Accession Number-1OAT) and P. falciparum OAT (PDB Accession Number-3NTJ) have been reported previously.26,27 More detailed sequence alignments were performed in Consurf with 300 sequence identified with a sequence identity between 25-90%.
Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Analysis and Phylogeny Construction. Nucleic acid sequences for Toxoplasma gondii ornithine aminotransferase were extracted from the toxodb website (http://toxodb.org/) for all available isolates. Sequences were formatted and exported as a FASTA file for analysis. Using PHYLIP (PHYLogeny Inference Package, v3.696) programs included in the Seaview phylogeny interface (http://doua.prabi.fr/software/seaview), 1000 pseudoreplicate data sets were created and an unrooted bootstrap consensus tree was constructed by parsimony analysis.
Cloning, expression and purification. Gene (GI: 237832613) of a putative OAT from T. gondii ME49 (OAT; truncated construct (residues 17-441); TgOAT(17-441)) was PCR-amplified and cloned into the IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside)-inducible pMCSG28 vector by the ligation-independent-cloning.28 The pMCSG28 vector possesses the C-terminal 6×His affinity tag and Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)/pMagic cells harboring the TgOAT(17-441)-pMCSG28 plasmid were grown in the Terrific Broth (TB) medium to OD600=0.6 at 37° C. followed by 1 mM IPTG induction at 25° C. overnight. Incubated cells were collected by centrifugation (6,000 rpm, 4° C., 10 min) and lysed by sonication in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.3 buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (BME) (buffer A) on ice. Soluble fraction and cell debris were separated by centrifugation at 19,000 rpm, 4° C. for 40 min. Supernatant was applied onto a 5-ml Ni-NTA column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.) and impurities were washed out using buffer A plus 25 mM imidazole. TgOAT(17-441) was eluted with 500 mM imidazole in buffer A and further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad™ 26/60 Superdex™ 200 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, N.J.). All purification steps were carried out on the ÄKTAxpress™ (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, N.J.) high-throughput purification system at 4° C. Final purity of the protein was assayed by SDS-PAGE.
TgOAT Antibody Production. Mice were injected with 50 μg of recombinant TgOAT, subcutaneously in the rump. The protein was formulated with an NISV (non-ionic surfactant vesicle) preparation to act as an adjuvant. The vesicles were made by melting mono-palmitoyl glycerol, cholesterol and dicetyl-phosphate (All from Sigma, UK) in a molar ratio of 5:4:1. Vesicles formed following the addition of warmed PBS pH 7.4 and vigorously vortexed for 2 minutes. Vesicle preparations were lyophilized and subsequently rehydrated with the appropriate protein dilutions. Vaccine preparations were stored at −20° C. until use and heated to 37° C. just prior to injection. Mice were given 2 injections of the vaccine, 2 weeks apart. 10 days after the final injection, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation the blood immediately harvested by cardiac puncture. Blood samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4° C. Serum was then transferred to a fresh tube and stored at −20° C. prior to shipping.
Enzyme Activity Assays. L-Ornithine, PLP, NADH, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Human recombinant pyrroline 5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) was purchased from CD Biosciences. Ultraviolet (UV) absorption was measured using a Synergy H1 hybrid multimode microplate reader (BioTek, USA) with transparent 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, USA).
Assay at Various Concentrations of TgOAT. Microplate wells were loaded with 90 μL of an assay mixture containing 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0, 11.1 mM α-ketoglutarate, 1.11 mM NADH, 0.028 mM PLP, 11.1 mM L-ornithine, and 2.5 ng of PYCR1. After incubating the mixture at 37° C. for 10 min, 10 μL of various concentrations of TgOAT in 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0 were added. The plate was shaken at 37° C. for 1 min, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 10 s for 90 min. All assays were performed in duplicate.
Determination the Km of Ornithine against TgOAT. Microplate wells were loaded with 90 μL of an assay mixture containing 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0, 11.1 mM α-ketoglutarate, 1.11 mM NADH, 0.028 mM PLP, 2.5 ng of PYCR1, and various concentrations of L-ornithine. After incubating the mixture at 37° C. for 10 min, 10 μL of TgOAT (1.0 mg/ml in 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0) were added. The plate was shaken at 37° C. for 1 min, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 10 s for 90 min. All assays were performed in duplicate.
Measurement of Kinetic Constants of an Inhibitor or Inactivator of TgOAT. Microplate wells were loaded with 90 μL of an assay mixture containing 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0, 11.1 mM α-ketoglutarate, 1.11 mM NADH, 0.028 mM PLP, 11.1 mM L-ornithine, 2.5 ng of PYCR1, and various concentrations of a compound. After incubating the mixture at 37° C. for 10 min, 10 μL of TgOAT (1.0 mg/ml in 100 mM potassium pyrophosphate at pH 8.0) were added. The plate was shaken at 37° C. for 1 min, and the absorbance was measured at 340 nm every 10 s for 90 min. All assays were performed in duplicate.
Crystallization, X-ray data collection and structure determination. The TgOAT protein with concentration of 7 mg/mL was crystallized in absence and presence of gabaculine and TgOAT-specific inactivators (compounds 1, 2, 5, 11 and 18, FIG. 3) by the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique at 295° K. The crystals of native TgOAT (PLP not bound to lysine 286) were grown in the conditions containing 200 mM ammonium acetate, 100 mM Bis-Tris pH 6.5 and 25% (w/v) PEG 3350. The structure of TgOAT with PLP bound to lysine 286 was obtained from co-crystallization of TgOAT with 5 mM compound 11 and 2 mM PLP followed by overnight incubation period at 4° C.; these crystals were grown in the conditions containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5 and 25% (w/v) PEG3350. The crystals of TgOAT in complex with gabaculine were obtained by co-crystallization with 5 mM gabaculine and 2 mM pyrodoxil-5'-phosphate (PLP). The good diffraction quality crystals with gabaculine were grown in the conditions containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5 and 25% (w/v) PEG3350. The crystals of TgOAT in complex with compound 18 in intermediate state and final inactivated state were obtained by co-crystallization with 5 mM compound 18 and 2 mM PLP followed by incubation period at 4° C. for 4 hours and overnight, respectively. The crystals of TgOAT in complex with compound 18 determined in intermediate and final states in the structure were grown in similar conditions containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 6.5 and 25% (w/v) PEG3350.
Prior to data collection, all crystals were soaked in well solution for cryoprotection and then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Monochromatic X-ray diffraction oscillation data from these crystals were collected at the Life Sciences Collaborative Access Team (LS-CAT) beamlines 21-ID-F (at 100° K; λ=0.97872 Å), 21-ID-G (at 100° K; λ=0.97856 Å), 21-ID-D (at 100° K; λ (Å)-fully tunable) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), Advanced Photon Source (APS). Data were processed with HKL-3000.29 The structures were determined by molecular replacement method using Phaser30 from the CCP4 suite31. The crystal structure of the related P. falciparum OAT (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 31g0;23 was used as a search model for native TgOAT structure that were later used to solve the structures of native TgOAT (with PLP in a bound state and an unbound state to lysine 286), and gabaculine-inactivated and 18-inactivated TgOAT. The initial structure solution for all determined structures was rebuilt using ARP/wARP.32 Water molecules, manual structure inspection and alteration of the rebuilt structural models were done in Coot33,34 and REFMAC v.5.835, respectively. The Translation-Libration-Screw (TLS) refinement (TLS groups were identified on TLSMD server http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/˜tlsmd/;36,37 was introduced at the final stages of refinement. Final model of structures was validated with the PDB validation server (ADIT validation server; http://deposit.pdb.org/validate/) and MolProbity;38,39 http://molprobity.biochem.duke.edu/). The structures were deposited to PDB under the accession code 4nog (native TgOAT with PLP not bound to lysine 286), 4zlv (TgOAT with PLP bound to lysine 286), XXXX (gabaculine-inactivated TgOAT), and YYYY (18-inactivated TgOAT). Table 2 contains detailed crystallographic data of deposited structures. Diffraction images for TgOAT (IDP92102 target) and its liganded structures are available at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases (CSGID) website (http://www.csgid.org/csgid/pages/home). The structural comparison between TgOAT and its homologues was done using web servers DALI, VAST and ProFunc.40-42 All figures presenting TgOAT structure were prepared in graphical program CCP4MG.43
Knockdown of TgOAT in Type I Parasites. Peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) targeted against the third splice site of mRNA coding for TgOAT was designed and purchased from Gene Tools, LLC. PPMOs are chains of nucleotide analogues complementary to, but structurally distinct from, RNA, and can prevent access of the spliceosome to specific splice sites, or prevent ribosomal binding and, thereby, protein translation.44-46 The sequence against which the PPMO was targeted is presented as SEQ ID NO:7. PPMOs have been used for molecular target validation in previous work.47 To test the efficacy of this targeted PPMO against T. gondii tachyzoites, human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were grown in black, flat-bottomed 96-well microplates. HFFs were infected with 2000 Type I RH parasites expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). This allowed quantification of parasites in vitro post-treatment with TgOAT-targeted PPMO. A concentration gradient of the YFP parasites was also established, allowing for quantification of knockdown. The parasites were incubated with the cells for one hour, to allow sufficient time for invasion of HFFs, and were then treated with PPMO. Control triplicates with only fibroblasts and with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (the current standard of treatment of T. gondii infection) were also conducted. Several runs of this efficacy assay were completed applying different concentrations of PPMO (2.5 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM). The cells and parasites were then incubated at 37° C. for 72 hours, this timing having been previously established in other work.48 Fluorescence was measured using a Bio-Tek Synergy™ H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.
In order to determine whether there was host cell toxicity from the PPMO, a WST-1 viability assay was conducted. HFFs were grown in black, flat-bottomed 96-well microplates. A gradient of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was used to quantify the amount of cell death caused by the PPMO in vitro, as some toxicity has been reported in the literature.44 Different concentrations of PPMO (3.5, 5, 10, and 20 μM) were used to identify the level at which toxicity occurred. Following 72 hours of incubation at 37° C., each well was treated with 10 μL WST-1, water soluble tetrazolium 1, which reacts in metabolically active, viable cells through a complex set of chemical reactions dependent upon glycolytic NADPH production to form formazan dyes, which can be detected via a colorimeter.
Effect of TgOAT Inactivators on T. gondii in vitro. HFFs were grown to confluence in black, flat-bottomed 96-well microplates. HFFs were infected with 2000 Type I RH parasites expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). The parasites were incubated with the cells for one hour, to allow sufficient time for invasion of HFFs, and were then treated with the TgOAT-specific GABA analogues (compounds 1, 2, 5, 11, and 18, FIG. 3) with the highest activity in inactivating TgOAT. Control triplicates with only fibroblasts and with pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (the current standard of treatment of T. gondii infection) were also conducted. The cells and parasites were then incubated at 37° C. for 72 hours. Fluorescence was measured using a Bio-Tek Synergy™ H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.
Measuring Effect of TgOAT Inactivators P. falciparum in vitro. The Malaria SYBR Green I-Based Fluorescence (MSF) Assay is a microtiter plate drug sensitivity assay that uses the presence of malarial DNA as a measure of parasitic proliferation in the presence of antimalarial drugs or experimental compounds. As the intercalation of SYBR Green I dye and its resulting fluorescence is relative to parasite growth, a test compound that inhibits the growth of the parasite will result in a lower fluorescence. D6 (CDC/Sierra Leone), TM91C235 (WRAIR, Thailand), and W2 (CDC/Indochina III) laboratory strains of P. falciparum were used for each drug sensitivity assessment. The parasite strains were maintained continuously in long-term cultures as previously described in Johnson et al.49 Pre-dosed microtiter drug plates for use in the MSF assay were produced using sterile 384-well black optical bottom tissue culture plates containing quadruplicate 12 two-fold serial dilutions of each test compound or mefloquine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Catalog #M2319) suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final concentration range tested was 0.5-10000 ng/mL for all assays. Predosed plates were stored at 4° C. until used, not to exceed five days. No difference was seen in drug sensitivity determination between stored or fresh drug assay plates (data not shown). A batch control plate using Chloroquine (Sigma-Aldrich Co., Catalog #C6628) at a final concentration of 2000 ng/ml was used to validate each assay run. The Tecan Freedom Evo liquid handling system (Tecan US, Inc., Durham, N.C.) was used to produce all drug assay plates. Based on modifications of previously described methods by Plouffe et al and Johnson et al, P. falciparum strains in late-ring or early-trophozoite stages were cultured in the predosed 384-well microtiter drug assay plates in 38 μL culture volume per well at a starting parasitemia of 0.3% and a hematocrit of 2%.49,50 The cultures were then incubated at 37° C. within a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2 and 90% N2, for 72 hours. Lysis buffer (38 μL per well), consisting of 20 mM Tris HCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1.6% Triton X, 0.016% saponin, and SYBR green I dye at a 20× concentration (Invitrogen, Catalog #S-7567) was then added to the assay plates for a final SYBR Green concentration of 10×. The Tecan Freedom Evo liquid handling system was used to dispense malaria cell culture and lysis buffer. The plates were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 24 hours and examined for the relative fluorescence units (RFU) per well using the Tecan Genios Plus (Tecan US, Inc., Durham, N.C.). Each drug concentration was transformed into Log [X] and plotted against the RFU values. The 50% and 90% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s and IC90s, respectively) were then generated with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the nonlinear regression (sigmoidal dose-response/variable slope) equation.
Results
Multi-Sequence Alignments and Phylogeny. In the alignment of amino acid sequences of known OATs, there is a high degree of conservation among T. gondii's close relatives, H. hammondi and Neospora caninum, with 96% and 89% sequence identity, respectively. There is markedly less conservation between T. gondii and the other organisms analyzed. Alignment of TgOAT and other organisms' OATs demonstrates approximately 49% sequence identity. There is 49% sequence identity between Tg, Pf, Fc, and Hs OAT, but the shared amino acids are not the same. Analysis of OAT genetic variability in 53 T. gondii isolated by parsimony reveals six distinct clusters of strains based on haplotype, consistent with major clades previously established on the basis of multilocus SNP analysis.51 Notable distinct isolate clusters in the OAT consensus tree include haplogroup 1, haplogroup 3, haplogroup 4, haplogroup 11, and haplogroup 14. Haplogroups 2 and 12, related clonal groups common in North America, comprise a single major branch. The isolated hyper-virulent Guiana appears to have diverse individual patterns for their OAT sequences.
TgOAT Activity Assays. We have recently developed and optimized two coupled assays for the continuous measurement of OAT activity.52 The more convenient assay employs human pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase 1 (PYCR1) to monitor the activity of OAT in converting ornithine to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde, which spontaneously cyclizes to form Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) (FIG. 7A). PYCR1, an NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form)-dependent enzyme, reduces the newly formed P5C to L-proline. With excess of PYCR1 used, the activity of OAT is directly proportional to the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, indicating the oxidation of NADH to NAD+. This bioassay was chosen to test the inhibition/inactivation activity of GABA analogues against TgOAT. The assay condition used for human OAT was first carried out for TgOAT, but the difference in the reaction rates between the positive control (no inhibitor/inactivator) and negative control (no enzyme) was barely distinguishable. This result suggests that the activity of TgOAT in converting ornithine to L-glutamate-5-semialdehyde is much less than that of human OAT. An experiment to determine an applicable condition of TgOAT for the bioassay was executed at various concentrations of TgOAT (FIG. 7B). The NADH was observed to be slowly decomposed over time, which has been known to occur in phosphate buffer and by UV radiation.53,54 When the concentration of TgOAT in the assay increased, the catalytic reaction rate increased, which led to a faster decomposition rate of NADH. At 100 μg/mL of TgOAT, the reaction rate had a clear difference from the negative control (no enzyme), so the concentration of 100 μg/mL of TgOAT was chosen for subsequent testing. To determine the Km of ornithine against TgOAT, an assay at various concentrations of ornithine was performed (FIG. 7C). The reaction rate at each concentration was estimated by linear regression analysis in the 30-60 minute range and then subtracted from the negative control (no ornithine). These reaction rates were then plotted against the concentrations of ornithine (FIG. 7D). The best fit curve was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation55 to afford a Km value of 31.0±4.0 mM.
Time-dependent and Concentration-dependent Inhibition of TgOAT by GABA Analogues. The compounds screened against TgOAT are shown in FIG. 3. For each compound, an assay at various concentrations was carried out and observed over a period of 90 minutes. When a compound acted as a reversible inhibitor of TgOAT, such as 12, the reaction rate at each concentration stayed constant during the run due to dependence on compound concentration, and not time (FIG. 8A). The percentage of enzyme activity at each concentration was estimated based on the reaction rate. IC50 was estimated from the plot of log ([inhibitor]) versus percentage of enzyme activity, and Ki value was calculated from the IC50 value.
When a compound acted as an inactivator of TgOAT, such as 2, the reaction rate at each concentration changed during the run because it would depend on both the concentration of the compound and time (FIG. 8B). Eventually, when given enough time, all enzymes would become inactivated, and the reaction rate would have the same value as the rate of the negative control. The inhibition constant (K1) and the rate constant of enzyme inactivation (kinact) were calculated using a modification from a recent published method, where each curve was fitted into equation 1 to obtain kobs value at each concentration.56 The kobs values were plotted against concentrations of the compound, and the best fit curve was then fitted into equation 2 to afford K1 and kinact values.

Structure of Native TgOAT. The crystal structure of native TgOAT from an ME49 parasite, with PLP not bound to lysine 286 was determined. The asymmetric unit in the TgOAT structure in its native form contains homodimer, a known protein functional unit.23,24,26,57,58 Each monomer consists of 3 domains: the large PLP-binding domain and two small domains in the N- and C terminus. The N-terminal domain comprises amino-acid residues 17-86 (αI (21-31), αII (35-43), βA (53-61), βB (62-66), βC (71-74), and αIII (76-81); it adopts small β-sheet with three antiparallel β-strands surrounded by three α-helices. The large PLP-binding domain comprises amino-acid residues 87-336 (αIV (87-101), βa (109-111), αV (113-125), βb (128-133), αVI (135-155), βc (162-167), αVII (176-181), αVIII (184-189), βd (197-202), αIX (205-214), βe (219-224), αX (238-250), βf (253-257), αXI (270-275), βg (281-285), βj (294-301), αXII (302-306), and αXIII (321-336); it adopts central eight-stranded β-sheet surrounded by ten α-helices including four short helical segments. The β-strands within the central β-sheet are parallel except of the strand βj, which runs in opposite direction to all other strands inside the β-sheet. The C-terminal domain is composed from amino-acid residues 337-441 (αXIV (339-359), βA' (366-371), βB' (374-379), αXV (385-396), βC' (397-402), βD' (407-413), and αXVI (418-439); it comprises four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices. Both monomers of native TgOAT dimer have a similar fold. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculations using program LSQKAB59 between the 422 aligned Cα atoms show the value of 0.28 Å. The dimer interface of TgOAT structure is formed by PLP-binding and N-terminal domains with the total buried surface area of 5748 Å2. There are 64 hydrogen bonds and 9 salt bridges that contribute to the dimer formation. The dimer interface mostly consists of residues located on αI, αII, βA, αIV, βa, αV, βb, αVI, αVII, and αVIII.
The TgOAT structure resembles similar structural fold to other enzymes from subgroup II of aminotransferase protein family.60,61 The structural comparison shows that hOAT58,62 with 51% homology and average RMSD value of 0.9 Å shares the closest secondary structural fold with TgOAT. The list of known OAT enzymes with determined structures that have similar structural fold also includes the OAT from P. falciparum (RMSD 1.46 Å, homology 49%),23,24 OAT from P. yoelii (RMSD 1.36 Å, homology 49%)24 and GABA-OAT from E. coli (RMSD 1.88 Å, homology 31%)63. There are also structures of uncharacterized OAT enzymes in the Protein Data Bank (www.rscb.org)64 with RMSD value<2 Å and homology>30% that share similar structural fold to TgOAT. Among them is OAT from Bacillus anthracis (PDBID 3RUY) and GABA-OAT from Mycobacterium smegmatis.65
We made a structural comparison of TgOAT with its homologs from H. sapiens, P. falciparum, P. yoelii and E. coli.23,26,66 The differences between TgOAT, hOAT, PfOAT and PyOAT are found mainly in the region comprises residues from C-terminal domain. The structures of PfOAT and PyOAT contain a large disordered region (171-196 residues long in TgOAT structure) in the PLP-binding domain that was omitted from the structural comparison. As mentioned earlier, the structure of GABA-OAT has a highest RMSD value and the largest displacements compare to TgOAT structure. The major differences between these structures were found in the loop between αII-βA of the TgOAT N-terminal domain; in βa, αV, βb and their connected loops, in the loop between αVI-βc, in the region comprises αVII, αVIII, βd, and αIX of the large PLP-binding domain; in the loop between βC'-βD' of the TgOAT C-terminal domain. Despite of structural dissimilarities between homologous structures, the PLP-binding pocket located on the interface of the two monomers of OAT dimer remains untouched.
There are two PLP-binding sites per TgOAT dimer that position 15 Å apart from each other. Inside the cavity, the PLP molecule binds in a similar binding mode observed in structures of hOAT, PfOAT, and GABA-OAT from E. coli.23,24,26,58,62 Residues from both monomers of the TgOAT dimer form the PLP-binding site. In the cavity the PLP molecule makes hydrogen bonds with T135, G136, A137, Y171, G172, E230, I256, D257, Q260, K286, S315, and T316 (FIG. 4). All of these residues are highly conserved in TgOAT and PfOAT structures. Exceptions were found between V75, A137, and Y171 residues, which in hOAT are substituted on phenylalanine, tyrosine and valine, respectively. Based on the electron density maps in the native TgOAT structure, the PLP doesn't form a Schiff base to the ε-amino group of the K286 in TgOAT monomers.
The structure of TgOAT with PLP bound to lysine 286 was obtained by co-crystallization with compound 11 (FIG. 3), but 11 was not observed at the active site of the enzyme. Comparison between TgOAT structures with PLP in a bound state and an unbound state to lysine 286 shows similar interactions between PLP and the protein residues (FIG. 4). There is a conformation change of the loop (50-54 residues) comprising the substrate-binding pocket in one of the monomers of TgOAT structure obtained in complex with the aldimine. In the TgOAT structure in presence of aldimine the pyridine ring of the PLP undergoes a rotation around C5A-O4P bond on 150 relatively to PLP in unbound state (FIG. 4). The overall position of the PLP in compared structures remains untouched with the small shift on 0.2 Å. The formation of the C4A=N bond at the right angle between the cofactor and K286 is an important feature of the OAT enzyme mechanism as it essential for proton transfer between PLP and the recognized substrate.
Structure of 18-inactivated TgOAT. The complex structures of TgOAT with intermediate metabolite 26 (FIG. 5A) and covalent adduct 31 (FIG. 5A) were determined by co-crystallization followed by 4 hours and 12 hours pre-incubation period with the compound 18, respectively. In the structures the amino group of the compound binds to the aldehyde position of the PLP via Schiff base. The final covalent adduct formed via Schiff base to K286 was identified in one of the protein monomers. The second monomer in the TgOAT structure in complex with the covalent adduct contains the compound in its intermediate state. In the structures, the compound occupies the TgOAT substrate-binding pocket that is formed by residues L76, G78, V79, N48, Y49, L106, R107, A108, Y171, R174, E229, K401, R409 and by H313, G314, S315, and T316 from the opposite monomer. In the pocket, the inactivator's carboxyl group makes strong interactions with OH atom of Y49 and N atom of the main chain of S315 from the opposite monomer. Additionally, the carboxyl group of the compound in TgOAT structures is mediated through water molecules with the side chain of atoms NH2 and OH of R174 and Y171, with main chain oxygen of S315, nitrogen of R107 and with O3P atom of the phosphate group of the cofactor (FIG. 5D). We have not observed conformational changes of the residues surrounding the substrate-binding site between compound-bound and compound-free state when TgOAT structures were compared.
Structure of gabaculine-inactivated TgOAT. To identify the specificity of TgOAT to gabaculine, which is an equally potent irreversible inhibitor of both human OAT and GABA-AT, we performed co-crystallization experiments with 5 mM gabaculine and obtained the TgOAT structure with gabaculine covalently bound to cofactor (FIGS. 6B, 6C). Similarly to compound 18, the carboxylate group of the gabaculine interacts with OH atom of Y49 and N atom of the main chain of S315. The position of the gabaculine at the TgOAT active site is similar to its position observed in the structure of human OAT.58 It has been shown that the interaction between aromatic ring of the gabaculine and protein's residues modulates binding affinity and keeps the product in a specific pose in the active site. The stacking favorable interaction between Y85 and F177 observed in the structure of human OAT.58 It has been shown that mutation of these two residues greatly reduces activity of the human OAT enzyme.57 Interestingly, that in the TgOAT structure, the Y85 (in hOAT) is substituted to V79. Therefore, the interaction between Y171 and the aromatic ring is sufficient to keep the product in that similar pose.
Inhibition on Tachyzoite Replication in vitro. None of the inactivators 1, 2, 5, 11, and 18 tested against Type I T. gondii tachyzoites showed statistically significant perturbation in vitro, even when the compounds were tested into the millimolar range. This indicates that these TgOAT inactivators have no effects on active T. gondii infection of human hosts.
Inhibition on P. falciparum in vitro. Compounds 1, 2, 5, and 11 were tested in the malaria SYBR Green fluorescence assay for drug potency against a drug sensitive P. falciparum parasite, D6 (Sierra Leone). All of the drugs tested showed IC50 values>10,000 ng/ml, and therefore were evaluated to have no detectable activity against P. falciparum.
Discussion
After TgOAT was successfully expressed and purified from E. coli, its multi-sequence and phylogeny were analyzed. Multi-sequence alignment revealed substantial variation between the species, with the following percentage homologies with TgOAT: H. hammondi-96%, N. caninum-89%, P. falciparum-49%, F. catus-49%, H. sapiens-49%. This means OAT is markedly less conserved in T. gondii across evolution time. Parsimony analysis of the OAT sequence in 53 T. gondii isolates is consistent with established multi-gene phylogentic trees for isolates of T. gondii. The consensus tree consists of branches with clusters of several major haplotype groups: 1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, and 14. In ToxoDB and work of Boothroyd et al, expression of TgOAT was ˜256 times higher in sporozoites than in tachyzoites and bradyzoites. This was confirmed using RT-PCR (FIG. 2).
For the past decades, we have developed many inhibitors and inactivators of γ-aminobutyric acid aminotransferase (GABA-AT), a PLP-dependent enzyme that degrades γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, for the treatment of epilepsy and many other neurological disorders.67-70 It has been reported that some inactivators of GABA-AT, such as gabaculine and 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid, also inactivate human OAT in vitro and in vivo,22,71 because the two enzymes share high structural similarities of their active sites.21 Therefore, a library of 23 GABA analogues (FIG. 3) was screened against TgOAT for selective inactivators or inhibitors. Inactivators are unreactive compounds that require catalytic activity from the enzyme to convert them into reactive species that then inactivate the enzyme. Because these molecules are not initially reactive, indiscriminate reactions with off-target proteins should be greatly reduced. Usually, inactivators can achieve greater selectivity and potency than conventional inhibitors.72 Compounds were chosen in the screened library because of their diversity in structures, including conformationally-rigid structures, aromatic structures, and flexible structures, in an attempt to identify different binding modes of the compounds to the active site of TgOAT. The kinetic constants for each compound are shown in Table 1. Of these compounds, 1, 2, 5, 11, and 18 have high activity in inactivating TgOAT. Results from other bioassays in our lab show that compound 1, also known as CPP-115 and recently finished a Phase I clinical trial for the treatment of epilepsy, is an extremely potent inactivator of GABA-AT73 and a potent inactivator of human OAT22. Compound 2 is a weak reversible inhibitor of GABA-AT74, but a highly potent inactivator of human OAT22. Compound 5 is a very weak reversible inhibitor of both GABA-AT68 and human OAT22. Compound 11 is a weak reversible inhibitor of GABA-AT75 and a weak inactivator of human OAT22. Compound 18 is a moderate inactivator of both GABA-AT76 and human OAT22. The screening has showed that while some strong inactivators of GABA-AT or human OAT, like 1 or 2, respectively, are also strong inactivators of TgOAT, other compounds, like 5, 11, and 18, have high specific inactivation towards TgOAT but not GABA-AT or human OAT. Thus, 5, 11, and 18 would offer a good starting point for the development of selective TgOAT inactivators.
Recombinant protein was also used to solve the crystal structures of native and inactivated TgOAT. The co-crystallization with the five identified inactivators (1, 2, 5, 11, and 18) and gabaculine, a potent inactivator of GABA-AT, yielded crystal structures of 18-inactivated and gabaculine-inactivated TgOAT. A proposed inactivation mechanism of TgOAT by 18 is shown in FIG. 5A. The inactivation is initiated by a Schiff base formation of 18 with the active site PLP, followed by γ-proton removal and release of fluoride, resulting in intermediate 26, which could either undergo catalytic hydrolysis to give aldimine 28 or return the PLP to lysine 286 and release enamine 30. Subsequent nucleophilic addition of 30 to the lysine-bound PLP gives rise to covalent adduct 31. Crystal structure of 18-inactivated TgOAT captured both intermediate 26 (FIG. 5B) and covalent adduct 31 (FIG. 5C). 18 was previously reported to inactivate GABA-AT by forming a corresponding covalent adduct in a similar fashion.76 A proposed inactivation mechanism of TgOAT by gabaculine is shown in FIG. 6A. The inactivation is initiated by a Schiff base formation of gabaculine with the active site PLP, followed by γ-proton removal and tautomerization, resulting in intermediate 34, which then undergoes another proton removal to give the final aromatic product 35. Crystal structure of gabaculine-inactivated TgOAT confirmed the structure of 35 (FIG. 6B). Gabaculine was previously reported to inactivate GABA-AT and human OAT by forming corresponding aromatic products in a similar fashion.58,77 The aromatic stabilization energy of the resulting benzene ring creates a large energy barrier to reversal and puts the product in a deep thermodynamic well, preventing the complex from further reaction.78 The crystal structures of the inactivated TgOAT indicated that both 18 and gabaculine interacted with Y49 and S315 at the protein active site. No interaction between 18 and the conserved R174, which plays an essential role in recognition of specific inhibitors of human OAT, was observed.
There is conservation of a pair of cysteines in the apicomplexan OATs, but not in other species' OATs. In P. falciparum, C154 and C168 have been demonstrated to bind an activator, thioredoxin, which reduces protein disulfides via a disulfide-exchange mechanism.23 One cysteine residue of the Cys-X-X-Cys motif on thioredoxin would perform a nucleophilic attack towards the disulfide of the target protein, resulting an intermolecular disulfide bond. The mixed-disulfide intermediate is subsequently cleaved, giving rise to a reduced protein and an oxidized thioredoxin.23 Unlike PfOAT, the TgOAT sequence between two conserved cysteines (C154 and C179) is one residue shorter, which might affect the formation of the disulfide bond in the TgOAT structure. An attempt to oxidize the recombinant TgOAT using oxidized glutathione did not lead to the formation of disulfide bond between C179 and C187; crystal structure of the treated TgOAT showed that the two cysteines remained in the reduced state, suggesting C179 and C187 might not be activated by thioredoxin like the corresponding cysteines in PfOAT.
To determine the biologic phenotype of T. gondii in the presence, absence, or reduction of TgOAT, two approaches were utilized. For Type I parasites, morpholino linked to a molecular transporter (PPMO) was utilized to alternatively splice the TgOAT gene. In the Type I strain, in vitro analysis demonstrated modest inhibition of replication (data not shown). The slower replicating Type II parasites were studied by making a knockout of the TgOAT gene. However, this knockout had no virulence phenotype, either in vitro or in vivo, and neither survival nor cyst number were altered significantly (data not shown). This left us with a modest phenotype in rapidly replicating parasites, and no obvious phenotype in the slower-growing Type IIs. Thus, inhibition of TgOAT was not likely to significantly modify outcomes due to active or dormant infection in humans. This finding, in conjunction with the observations of the 256-fold increase in expression of TgOAT in sporozoites, led to our hypothesis that inhibition of the enzyme in the cat form might be useful in blocking transmission of the parasite. Further studies are being conducted in this direction; if inhibition of TgOAT eliminates shedding of infectious oocysts into the environment, this would have the potential to prevent diseases caused by T. gondii and consequent infection present in the human population and in livestock animals. The compounds 1, 2, 5, 11, and 18 were also tested against the growth of P. falciparum. However, a live-cell parasite assay revealed the compounds had no anti-malarial activity at concentrations up to 10000 ng/mL (data not shown).
Conclusion
Ornithine aminotransferase is an important enzyme that plays a crucial role in preventing toxic accumulation of ornithine in the cell. A selective inhibition of OAT in T. gondii over human OAT might render a solution in the fight against this parasite. We have characterized a number of features of TgOAT: the gene, protein, abundance in different life cycle stages, and enzyme activity. A screening of our library of 23 GABA analogues resulted in several selective inactivators of TgOAT. Crystal structures of the native and inactivated enzymes were obtained. Two different inactivation mechanisms of two different inactivators were identified: one by gabaculine, which inactivated the enzyme by forming an aromatic ring inside the active site, and the other by (S)-4-amino-5-fluoropentanoic acid, 18, which inactivated the enzyme by forming a covalent adduct to the enzyme. These newly identified TgOAT inactivators and insights of the enzyme binding pocket from crystal structures lay a foundation of further studies of selective inactivation of TgOAT and drug development.
