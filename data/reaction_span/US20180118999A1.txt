BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
1. Field of the Invention

More particularly, embodiments of the present disclosure relates to clay stabilization compositions and methods for making and using same, where the compositions include derivatized polyamine and where the polyamines are non-polymeric.
2. Description of the Related Art
Swelling clays and migrating fines are a frequent cause of formation damage. When fresh water is introduced to a formation that contains natural brine, swelling clays and migrating fines can bridge off capillaries and block the movement of fluids to the wellbore. This loss of permeability can seriously impair the recovery of hydrocarbons from the well. Additionally, clays and fines can be brought to the wellbore during production and lead to abrasion damage of pumping equipment.
A variety of methods for inhibiting the swelling of clays and migration of fines have been devised. Brine slugs have been used prior to the introduction of drilling or stimulation fluids. The most common method is to add organic or inorganic salts to drilling and/or stimulation fluids in order to stabilize the clays. For many years, the most commonly used salt was potassium chloride. The K+ cation undergoes an ion exchange with the Na+ cation on the clay, converting it to a non-swelling form. In recent years, quaternized organic salts such as tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) and choline chloride have been used with success. Together, these low molecular weight salts are considered to be temporary clay stabilizers because the single ionic bond they form with the clay make them susceptible to a reverse ion exchange with Na+ when the well is put into production. This converts the clay from the non-swelling form back to the swelling form.
Polymers have been used to address the problem of temporary clay stabilizers. Multiple cationic sites along a polymer chain means a greater charge density, and more sites for the polymer to bond to the clay. These clay stabilizing polymers are known as permanent clay stabilizers. While cationic polymers used for clay stabilization are effective and long-lasting, the high molecular weight of most polymers means that they can become problematic in tight or low porosity wells. The polymers can plate out on the rock face, thereby blocking flow through the capillaries.
Thus, there is a need in the art for non-polymeric clay stabilization compositions for use in treating subterranean formations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
The inventor has found that an ideal solution to the problem of clay stabilization is a molecule that contains multiple cationic sites for stronger bonding to the clay, but is non-polymeric so that it does not constrict fluid movement through the formation. Triaminononane (TAN), 4-aminomethyl-1,8-octanediamine, is a tri-functional primary amine that may be derivatized to form alkylated and quaternized products. The increased charge density of the derivatized molecule allows it to bind more strongly to swelling clays, while its relatively low molecular weight allow it to stabilize the clay permanently without causing formation damage by blocking pore throats and reducing permeability.
The clay stabilizers of the present disclosure are permanent but possess a low molecular weight and include where the compositions include one or more compounds of the general Formulas I and II:

<in-line-formulae>HC(RNR1R2R7)(R'NR3R4R8)(R″NR5R6R9)Xn  (II)</in-line-formulae>
where the R, R', and R″ groups are the same or different that are hydrocarbyl linking groups having between 1 and 8 carbon atoms, when the R, R', and R″ groups include 2 to 8 carbon atoms, then one or more carbon atoms may be replaced by oxygen atoms, acetate groups, or carbonyl groups, where the R1-6 groups are the same or different and are hydrogen atoms or hydrocarbyl groups including from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, when the R1-6 groups include 2 to 6 carbon atoms, then one or more carbon atoms may be replaced by oxygen atoms, acetate groups, or carbonyl groups, where the R7-9 groups are the same or different and are absent, a hydrogen atom, or a hydrocarbyl group including from 1 to 6 carbon atoms; provided, however, that at least one of the R7-9 groups is a hydrogen atom or a hydrocarbyl group, when the R7-9 groups include 2 to 6 carbon atoms, then one or more carbon atoms may be replaced by oxygen atoms, acetate groups, or carbonyl groups, and where the X groups are the same or different and each of the X groups is a halide ion, a formate ion, an acetate ion, a phosphate ion, a fumarate ion, a sulfate ion, a hydrogensulfate ion, alkylsulfate ion, a citrate ion, an oxalate ion, or mixtures thereof, and where n is an integer having a value between 1 and 3. In certain embodiments, the R, R', and R″ groups are the same or different and are linear alkyl linking groups having between 1 and 8 carbon atoms of the formula -(CH2)m-, where m is an integer having a value between 2 and 8. In other embodiments, the R group is a linear alkyl group having between 1 and 3 carbon atoms, the R' group is linear alkyl group having between 2 and 4 carbon atoms, and the R″ group is linear alkyl linking groups having between 3 and 5 carbon atoms.

In addition, the proppant can be coated with resin or a proppant flowback control agent such as fibers for instance can be simultaneously pumped. By selecting proppants having a contrast in one of such properties such as density, size and concentrations, different settling rates will be achieved.
Propping agents or proppants are typically added to the fracturing fluid prior to the addition of a crosslinking agent. However, proppants may be introduced in any manner which achieves the desired result. Any proppant may be used in embodiments of the invention. Examples of suitable proppants include, but are not limited to, quartz sand grains, glass and ceramic beads, walnut shell fragments, aluminum pellets, nylon pellets, and the like. Proppants are typically used in concentrations between about 1 to 8 lbs. per gallon of a fracturing fluid, although higher or lower concentrations may also be used as desired. The fracturing fluid may also contain other additives, such as surfactants, corrosion inhibitors, mutual solvents, stabilizers, paraffin inhibitors, tracers to monitor fluid flow back, and so on.
Besides the proppant concentrations in the final formulation, the particles sizes of the proppants are also a factor in the performance of the fluids of this invention. In certain embodiments, the proppants have sizes of 16/20 mesh, 16/30 mesh, 20/40 mesh and mixtures and combinations thereof. In addition, proppant density is another factor in the performance of the fluids of this invention. Exemplary examples of the proppants useful in this invention include, without limitation, CARBO-HSP® 16/30 mesh and 20/40 mesh having a bulk density=2 g/cm3 and CARBO-LITE® 16/20 mesh and 20/40 mesh having a bulk density=1.57 g/cm3, and mixtures or combinations thereof.
Cross-Linking Agents
Suitable cross-linking agent for use in this invention when the compositions include minor amount of natural hydratatable polymers include, without limitation, any suitable cross-linking agent for use with the gelling agents. Exemplary cross-linking agents include, without limitation, di- and tri-valent metal salts such as calcium salts, magnesium salts, barium salts, copperous salts, cupric salts, ferric salts, aluminum salts, or mixtures or combinations thereof.
A suitable crosslinking agent can be any compound that increases the viscosity of the fluid by chemical crosslinking, physical crosslinking, or any other mechanisms. For example, the gellation of a hydratable polymer can be achieved by crosslinking the polymer with metal ions including boron in combination with zirconium, and titanium containing compounds. The amount of the crosslinking agent used also depends upon the well conditions and the type of treatment to be effected, but is generally in the range of from about 0.001 wt. % to about 2 wt. % of metal ion of the crosslinking agent in the hydratable polymer fluid. In some applications, the aqueous polymer solution is crosslinked immediately upon addition of the crosslinking agent to form a highly viscous gel. In other applications, the reaction of the crosslinking agent can be retarded so that viscous gel formation does not occur until the desired time.
When the synthetic hydratable compositions of this invention include no or substantially no natural hydratable polymers, then viscosity may be increased solely by the addition of a sufficient amount of an aqueous alkali solution to the compositions. When pH goes up to about pH 6 to about pH 10, the viscosity is increased due to the ionization of carboxylic acid group and the formation of ionic interactions with metal ions.
The boron based crosslinking agents may be selected from the group consisting of boric acid, sodium tetraborate, and mixtures thereof. These are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,514,309. In some embodiments, the well treatment fluid composition may further comprise a proppant.
Breakers
The term “breaking agent” or “breaker” refers to any chemical that is capable of reducing the viscosity of a gelled fluid. As described above, after a fracturing fluid is formed and pumped into a subterranean formation, it is generally desirable to convert the highly viscous gel to a lower viscosity fluid. This allows the fluid to be easily and effectively removed from the formation and to allow desired material, such as oil or gas, to flow into the well bore. This reduction in viscosity of the treating fluid is commonly referred to as “breaking”. Consequently, the chemicals used to break the viscosity of the fluid is referred to as a breaking agent or a breaker. In certain embodiments, the breaker is a salt or a brine solution. In other embodiments, the breaker is an encapsulated salt, where the encapsulating material is designed to degrade after a desire time of exposure to a base fluid or by the addition of an agent that disrupts the encapsulating material releasing the salt. In other embodiments, the breaker is a brine added to the fracturing fluid in an amount sufficient to break the viscosity of the fracturing fluid. The brines may be any brine solution including sodium chloride brines, calcium chloride brines, or other brines capable of reducing the viscosity of the synthetic hydratable polymers used in the fracturing fluids of this invention.
There are various methods available for breaking a fracturing fluid or a treating fluid. Typically, fluids break after the passage of time and/or prolonged exposure to high temperatures. However, it is desirable to be able to predict and control the breaking within relatively narrow limits. Mild oxidizing agents are useful as breakers when a fluid is used in a relatively high temperature formation, although formation temperatures of 300° F. (149° C.) or higher will generally break the fluid relatively quickly without the aid of an oxidizing agent.
Examples of inorganic breaking agents for use in this invention include, but are not limited to, persulfates, percarbonates, perborates, peroxides, perphosphates, permanganates, etc. Specific examples of inorganic breaking agents include, but are not limited to, alkaline earth metal persulfates, alkaline earth metal percarbonates, alkaline earth metal perborates, alkaline earth metal peroxides, alkaline earth metal perphosphates, zinc salts of peroxide, perphosphate, perborate, and percarbonate, and so on. Additional suitable breaking agents are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,877,127; 5,649,596; 5,669,447; 5,624,886; 5,106,518; 6,162,766; and 5,807,812, incorporated herein by reference. In some embodiments, an inorganic breaking agent is selected from alkaline earth metal or transition metal-based oxidizing agents, such as magnesium peroxides, zinc peroxides, and calcium peroxides.
In addition, enzymatic breakers may also be used in place of or in addition to a non-enzymatic breaker. Examples of suitable enzymatic breakers such as guar specific enzymes, alpha and beta amylases, amyloglucosidase, aligoglucosidase, invertase, maltase, cellulase, and hemi-cellulase are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,806,597 and 5,067,566, incorporated herein by reference.
A breaking agent or breaker may be used “as is” or be encapsulated and activated by a variety of mechanisms including crushing by formation closure or dissolution by formation fluids. Such techniques are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,506,734; 4,741,401; 5,110,486; and 3,163,219, incorporated herein by reference.
The above breaker may also be encapsulated in a polymeric coating that decomposes in the fluids at a predetermined or known rate so that the breaker are release into the system only after the encapsulation agent decomposes or the capsules break under downhole conditions.
Suitable ester compounds include any ester which is capable of assisting the breaker in degrading the viscous fluid in a controlled manner, i.e., providing delayed breaking initially and substantially complete breaking after well treatment is completed. An ester compound is defined as a compound that includes one or more carboxylate groups: R-COO-, wherein R is phenyl, methoxyphenyl, alkylphenyl, C1-C11 alkyl, C1-C11 substituted alkyl, substituted phenyl, or other organic radicals. Suitable esters include, but are not limited to, diesters, triesters, etc.
An ester is typically formed by a condensation reaction between an alcohol and an acid by eliminating one or more water molecules. Ester may hydrolyze to regenerate the organic acid, which reduces the pH of the fluid, thus decreasing a viscosity of fluid including the synthetic hydratable polymers. Other degradable polymers can be used such as PLA, PGA as delayed acid generator. Since they are solid they can also behave as fluid loss agents. Preferably, the acid is an organic acid, such as a carboxylic acid. A carboxylic acid refers to any of a family of organic acids characterized as polycarboxylic acids and by the presence of more than one carboxyl group. In additional to carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, a carboxylic acid may include heteroatoms, such as S, N, P, B, Si, F, Cl, Br, and I. In some embodiments, a suitable ester compound is an ester of oxalic, malonic, succinic, malic, tartaric, citrate, phthalic, ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic, phosphoric acids, etc. Moreover, suitable esters also include the esters of glycolic acid. The alkyl group in an ester that comes from the corresponding alcohol includes any alkyl group, both substituted or unsubstituted. Preferably, the alkyl group has one to about ten carbon atoms per group. It was found that the number of carbon atoms on the alkyl group affects the water solubility of the resulting ester. For example, esters made from C1-C2 alcohols, such as methanol and ethanol, have relatively higher water solubility. Thus, application temperature range for these esters may range from about 120° F. to about 250° F. (about 49° C. to about 121° C.). For higher temperature applications, esters formed from C3-C10 alcohols, such as n-propanol, butanol, hexanol, and cyclohexanol, may be used. Of course, esters formed from C11 or higher alcohols may also be used. In some embodiments, mixed esters, such as acetyl methyl dibutyl citrate, may be used for high temperature applications. Mixed esters refer to those esters made from polycarboxylic acid with two or more different alcohols in a single condensation reaction. For example, acetyl methyl dibutyl citrate may be prepared by condensing citric acid with both methanol and butanol and then followed by acylation.
Specific examples of the alkyl groups originating from an alcohol include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, iso-butyl, 2-butyl, t-butyl, benzyl, p-methoxybenzyl, m-methoxybenxyl, chlorobenzyl, p-chlorobenzyl, phenyl, hexyl, pentyl, etc. Specific examples of suitable ester compounds include, but are not limited to, triethyl phosphate, diethyl oxalate, dimethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, diethyl maleate, diethyl tartrate, 2-ethoxyethyl acetate, ethyl acetylacetate, triethyl citrate, acetyl triethyl citrate, tetracyclohexyl EDTA, tetra-1-octyl EDTA, tetra-n-butyl EDTA, tetrabenzyl EDTA, tetramethyl EDTA, etc. Additional suitable ester compounds are described, for example, in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,990,978; 3,960,736; 5,067,556; 5,224,546; 4,795,574; 5,693,837; 6,054,417; 6,069,118; 6,060,436; 6,035,936; 6,147,034; and 6,133,205, incorporated herein by reference.
When an ester of a polycarboxylic acid is used, total esterification of the acid functionality is preferred, although a partially esterified compound may also be used in place of or in addition to a totally esterified compound. In these embodiments, phosphate esters are not used alone. A phosphate ester refers to a condensation product between an alcohol and a phosphorus acid or a phosphoric acid and metal salts thereof. However, in these embodiments, combination of a polycarboxylic acid ester with a phosphate ester may be used to assist the degradation of a viscous gel.
When esters of polycarboxylic acids, such as esters of oxalic, malonic, succinic, malic, tartaric, citrate, phthalic, ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), nitrilotriacetic, and other carboxylic acids are used, it was observed that these esters assist metal based oxidizing agents (such as alkaline earth metal or zinc peroxide) in the degradation of fracturing fluids. It was found that the addition of 0.1 L/m3 to 5 L/m3 of these esters significantly improves the degradation of the fracturing fluid. More importantly, the degradation response is delayed, allowing the fracturing fluid ample time to create the fracture and place the proppant prior to the degradation reactions. The delayed reduction in viscosity is likely due to the relatively slow hydrolysis of the ester, which forms polycarboxylate anions as hydrolysis products. These polycarboxylate anions, in turn, improve the solubility of metal based oxidizing agents by sequestering the metal associated with the oxidizing agents. This may have promoted a relatively rapid decomposition of the oxidizing agent and caused the fracturing fluid degradation.
Generally, the temperature and the pH of a fracturing fluid affects the rate of hydrolysis of an ester. For downhole operations, the bottom hole static temperature (“BHST”) cannot be easily controlled or changed. The pH of a fracturing fluid usually is adjusted to a level to assure proper fluid performance during the fracturing treatment. Therefore, the rate of hydrolysis of an ester could not be easily changed by altering BHST or the pH of a fracturing fluid. However, the rate of hydrolysis may be controlled by the amount of an ester used in a fracturing fluid. For higher temperature applications, the hydrolysis of an ester may be retarded or delayed by dissolving the ester in a hydrocarbon solvent. Moreover, the delay time may be adjusted by selecting esters that provide more or less water solubility. For example, for low temperature applications, polycarboxylic esters made from low molecular weight alcohols, such as methanol or ethanol, are recommended. The application temperature range for these esters could range from about 120° F. to about 250° F. (about 49° C. to about 121° C.). On the other hand, for higher temperature applications or longer injection times, esters made from higher molecular weight alcohols should preferably be used. The higher molecular weight alcohols include, but are not limited to, C3-C6 alcohols, e.g., n-propanol, hexanol, and cyclohexanol.
In some embodiments, esters of citric acid are used in formulating a well treatment fluid. A preferred ester of citric acid is acetyl triethyl citrate, which is available under the trade name Citraflex A2 from Morflex, Inc., Greensboro, N.C.

Oxygen Control
The introduction of fracturing fluids downhole often is accompanied by an increase in the oxygen content of downhole fluids due to oxygen dissolved in the introduced water. Thus, the materials introduced downhole must work in oxygen environments or must work sufficiently well until the oxygen content has been depleted by natural reactions. For a system that cannot tolerate oxygen, then oxygen must be removed or controlled in any material introduced downhole. The problem is exacerbated during the winter when the injected materials include winterizers such as water, alcohols, glycols, Cellosolves, formates, acetates, or the like and because oxygen solubility is higher to a range of about 14-15 ppm in very cold water. Oxygen can also increase corrosion and scaling. In CCT (capillary coiled tubing) applications using dilute solutions, the injected solutions result in injecting an oxidizing environment (O2) into a reducing environment (CO2, H2S, organic acids, etc.).
Options for controlling oxygen content includes: (1) de-aeration of the fluid prior to downhole injection, (2) addition of normal sulfides to produce sulfur oxides, but such sulfur oxides can accelerate acid attack on metal surfaces, (3) addition of erythorbates, ascorbates, diethylhydroxyamine or other oxygen reactive compounds that are added to the fluid prior to downhole injection; and (4) addition of corrosion inhibitors or metal passivation agents such as potassium (alkali) salts of esters of glycols, polyhydric alcohol ethyloxylates or other similar corrosion inhibitors. Oxygen and corrosion inhibiting agents include mixtures of tetramethylene diamines, hexamethylene diamines, 1,2-diaminecyclohexane, amine heads, or reaction products of such amines with partial molar equivalents of aldehydes. Other oxygen control agents include salicylic and benzoic amides of polyamines, used especially in alkaline conditions, short chain acetylene diols or similar compounds, phosphate esters, borate glycerols, urea and thiourea salts of bisoxalidines or other compound that either absorb oxygen, react with oxygen or otherwise reduce or eliminate oxygen.

EXPERIMENTS OF THE INVENTION
TAN Salts
Examples 1-16 illustrate the formation of 4-aminomethyl-1,8-octanediamine (TAN) salts by reacting TAN with an acid component, which was either introduced directly if it was a liquid or it was dissolved in deionized water, if it was a solid. The reactions were generally carried out in a 250 ml three-neck reactor flask, with the TAN transferred to a reactor flask first and then the acid component and the reaction stirred at an elevated temperature. Table 1 tabulates certain reaction components and properties of the resulting TAN salts.
Example 1
These examples illustration the procedure used to form a TAN formate salt by reacting TAN with formic acid.
36.0 g (0.21 mol) of TAN were charged into a 250 mL three neck round bottom flask reactor equipped with a thermocouple, an Allihn water condenser, and a 100 mL additional funnel containing 30.0 g (95%, 0.63 mol) of formic acid dissolved in 15.5 g of deionized water. The reactor was cooled in an ice-water bath, and the contents of the reaction mixture were stirred using an overhead stirrer at 300 rpm. The aqueous formic acid solution was added at a rate such that the temperature did not exceed 110° F. After complete addition of formic acid, which took about 15 min, the reactor was removed from the cooling bath and refluxed at 165° F. for 30 minutes. After completion of the reaction, the contents were cooled to room temperature (75° F.). All of the other examples were carried out similarly.

Coreflood Experiments
2 wt % KCl brine and DI water were used in the coreflood experiments. The density and viscosity of the brine were 1.008 g/cm3 and 0.98 cP, respectively, at 68° F. The coreflood experimental condition was 200° F., and there was a backpressure of 500 psi at the outlet. Bandera sandstone cores were used in the coreflood experiments. The mineralogy of Bandera sandstone was determined by X-ray diffraction.
Experimental Steps
The coreflood experiments were carried out using the following steps:1. Cores were dried in the oven at 250° F. for at least 5 hours. The weight of the dry cores is measured.2. The cores were saturated with 2 wt. % KCl brine under vacuum for 4 hours and then weighed again. The pore volume was calculated from the difference in weights.3. Initial permeability was measured using brine when the differential pressure stabilizes at different flow rates.4. Brine was injected into the core until the pressure drop stabilizes at 200° F.5. Two PV of the clay stabilizer treatment was injected through the core, followed by DI water.6. The permeability of each core was compared before and after clay stabilizer treatment.
The improvement factor is expressed as a ratio of effective gas permeability after the clay stabilizer treatment to the effective gas permeability before the clay stabilizer treatment and is given by the formula:
<img> id-US20180118999A1-20180503-M00001.TIF </img>ImprovementFactor=KfKi
where Kf is the final core gas permeability after treatment and Ki is the initial (untreated) core gas permeability.
