Technical Field
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical chemistry, and particularly relates to a xanthine derivative and a preparation method thereof and a use of such compound as a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor.
Background
Diabetes is a polyetiological metabolic disease, characterized by chronic hyperglycemia accompanied with disorder of glucose, fat and protein metabolism caused by insulin secretion and/or effect defects. Diabetes is also a very old disease. It is caused by relative or absolute lack of insulin in the human body, which leads to rise of the concentration of glucose in the blood and this further leads to excretion of a large volume of glucose from urine accompanied with symptoms such as polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, emaciation, dizziness, debilitation, etc.
In diabetes treatment, exercise therapy and diet therapy are two essential types of therapeutic methods for diabetes. When these two therapeutic methods are not sufficient to control the disease, insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs can be used. But because there are many side effects in these hypoglycemic drugs, it is particularly important to develop a new and low-side effect drug that can effectively treat diabetes. DPP-IV is a serine protease; it can split N-terminal dipeptidase in a peptide chain containing a proline residue at the secondary end; although the physiological effect of DPP-IV to mammals has not been fully confirmed, it plays a very important role in the process of neural enzyme metabolism, T-cell activation, cancer cells metastasizing in endothelium and HIV virus entering lymphoid cells (WO98/19998).
Studies have shown that DPP-IV can inhibit the secretion of Glucagon-Like Peptide (GLP)-1 and split His-Ala dipeptide at N-terminal in (GLP)-1 so that it is degraded from active form (GLP)-1 (Endocrinology, 1999, 140:5356-5363). Under physiological conditions, the half-life period of the intact (GLP)-1 is short in circulating blood, and DPP-IV inhibitor can completely protect the endogenous and exogenous (GLP)-1 from inactivating by DPP-IV, which greatly improves the physiological activity of (GLP)-1 (from 5 to 10 times). Because (GLP)-1 is an important stimulator for secretion of pancreatic insulin and can directly affect the distribution of glucose, DPP-IV inhibitor has very good effects for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes patients (US6110949).
Currently marketed DPP-IV inhibitors include sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, alogliptin and linagliptin and so on. Wherein linagliptin has less liver and kidney function damage. The structural formula of linagliptin is as follows:<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>
According to the report sent by linagliptin to FDA, it was disclosed that bioavailability of linagliptin in mouse and human body was not high (CD-1 mouse, 5 mg/kg, F = 18.4%; man, 5 mg/subject, F = 30%). Therefore, providing a compound to replace linagliptin is a problem to be solved urgently.
Summary of the Invention
In order to solve the above-mentioned problem, the present invention carries out structural modification to it based on linagliptin so as to obtain a compound with more safety, higher activity and better bioavailability.
The present invention provides a kind of compounds with the activity of inhibiting DPP-IV and can be used for medicine for the treatment or mitigation of DPP-IV related diseases.
Linagliptin is the drug with highest activity and least toxicity to liver and kidney in DPP-IV inhibitors on the market; compounds obtained by the method of the present invention have similar activity with linagliptin, especially the activity of compound I-3 which is better than linagliptin, can better treat DPP-IV related diseases (such as diabetes, hyperglycemia, obesity or insulin resistance) in the future.

Experiment example III, hERG toxicity research
1. Test method: testing the effect of the compounds on hERG sodium current in stable CHO cell lines transfected hERG sodium channels by manual patch clamp method, and then calculating IC50 value of the compounds to hERG.Conventional Patch-Clamp was a technology that has been disclosed, was the most important technical means for studying ion channels and was universally recognized as the "gold standard" for ion channel researches and was the most accurate method for measuring ion channel. It was applicable to study the action mechanism of the effect of compound and the ion channel, and also could be used for toxicity evaluation and structure optimization of candidate drugs in the process of new drugs.In cardiomyocytes, human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) coded potassium channel mediates a delayed rectification potassium current (IKr), IKr inhibition was the most important mechanism leading to QT interval prolongation by drugs. hERG could be inhibited by compounds of diversified structures, due to its specific molecular structure. Currently, testing effects of compounds on hERG potassium channel was a critical step in pre-clinical evaluation of cardiac safety of compounds, and was indispensable material for new drugs registration required by FDA.The effects of compounds on hERG could be tested and relevant IC50 could be determined by conventional patch-clamp, using CHO cell lines that had been stably transfected hERG potassium channel.2. Experimental results: IC50 of TSL-0319 to hERG was 79.80 µM in the hERG experiments. (IC50 of linagliptin to hERG was not reported, it was only mentioned that the inhibition rate to hERG was 3% under 1 µM concentration; and the inhibition rate of TSL-0319 to hERG was 0% under 1 µM concentration.)
Calculated according to requirement of 20 times more than Cmax, when the dosage of TSL-0319 is 5 mg/kg, Cmax in mice was 200-500 nM, IC50 to hERG should be more than 20 µM, therefore, TSL-0319 was safe in hERG toxicity, and was significantly better than linagliptin.
Experiment example IV, drug-drug interaction research(DDI)
1. Test method: human liver microsomes were used to carry out inhibition activity test of the compounds to CYP enzyme.With the system for incubating human liver microsomes in vitro, the content variation of phenacetin, diclofenac, S-mephenytoin, dextromethorphan and midazolam, which were substrates of human liver microsomes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, were measured simultaneously by cocktail probe drug method (which is a disclosed technology), the effects of TSL-0319 under different concentrations on activity of human liver microsomes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 subtypes are evaluated and relavant IC50 was measured.2.Experimental results:
<table>
TSL-0319 concentration µM & 0 & 0.0 5 & 0.1 5 & 0.5 & 1.5 & 5 & 15 & 50
Inhibition rate (%) to CYP1A2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2.2 & 4.2 & 6.6 & 20. 8 & 41. 8
Inhibition rate (%) to CYP2C9 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 3.2 & 5.7 & 10. 5 & 12. 1 & 13. 9
Inhibition rate (%) to CYP2C19 & 0 & 0 &  &  & 3.3 & 8.2 & 14 & 2.9

Inhibition rate (%) to CYP3A4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 4.4 & 8.7 & 17. 9 & 44. 6
</table>
Conclusions: IC50 of TSL-0319 to five metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 were all greater than 50 µM, therefore, the use of TSL-0319 would not affect the metabolism of other drugs, and it could be used by being combined with other drugs.

3. Conclusions:
CD-1 mice were used to do pharmacokinetics experiments of TSL-0319, its T1/2 was greatly different from disclosed data of linagliptin while being compared, due to the setting of blood taking points and LLOQ, but the bioavailability of 60.5% was much higher than that of linagliptin under the same condition(CD-1 mice were used to do pharmacokinetics experiments of linagliptin, 5mg/kg, oral administration, and the bioavailability was 18.4%).
The structures of the compounds I-1∼I-2, 1-4 in the present invention were similar to that of I-3, therefore compounds I-1∼I-2, 1-4 all had the same pharmacodynamic effects with compound I-3.
