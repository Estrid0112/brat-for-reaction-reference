FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The disclosure herein relates to compounds, compositions and methods of use for the synthesis of oligonucleotides modified by building blocks of non-nucleosidic structure. For example, the disclosure relates to non-nucleosidic phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports for synthesis of modified oligonucleotides, compositions comprising such non-nucleosidic phosphoramidite building blocks, solid supports, and methods of using such building blocks and supports in the synthesis of modified oligonucleotides.
SUMMARY OF THE RELATED ART
A number of innovations have been introduced to the art of oligonucleotide synthesis. Amongst these innovations have been the development of excellent orthogonal protecting groups, activators, reagents, and synthetic conditions. The oligonucleotides themselves have been subject to a variety of modifications and improvements. Amongst these are chemistries that deliver properties that are not present in naturally occurring oligonucleotides i.e. reduced negative charge, hydrophobicity, ability to emit fluorescence, protein and receptor binding properties, etc. These novel chemistries generally involve modification building blocks of non-nucleosidic nature that become constituent parts of the oligonucleotide.
There are several structural motifs known in the art for the construction of non-nucleosidic reagents for making derivatized synthetic oligonucleotides.
A number of non-nucleosidic phosphoramidite reagents and solid supports disclosed have been derived from 1,2-diols featuring a side chain for the attachment of ligands via linkers of variable length. In these structures, the primary hydroxy group is used for the placement of a 4,4'-dimethoxytrityl (DMT) group, while an amidite or a succinate moiety is placed at the secondary hydroxy group.
Two approaches to attach a side chain bearing a ligand are known in the art. In one approach, the primary hydroxy group of glycerol is alkylated by a side chain bearing a functional group for further extension with a ligand. A variety of phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed for the attachment of amino groups (WO 2008/129548, US 20160039850, U.S. Pat. No. 8,292,209, U.S. Pat. No. 9,156,865), carbonyl groups (WO 2007/106907), tocopherol (WO 2008/014979), cholesterol (WO 2015/091958, WO 2010/129672, WO 2008/014979, WO 94/04550, U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,487, WO 2010/151714), other hydrophobic modifiers (WO 2014/147095, US20160017325, WO 2006/125447, U.S. Pat. No. 5,420,330) biotin (WO 2015/091958, WO 2010/151714, WO 91/17169, U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,487), fluorescent labels (WO/2005-JP7666, EP 1538154, WO 2004/022703, WO 2003/052132, WO 2003/052133, WO 96/28438, WO 96/20289, WO 94/24120, WO 91/17169, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,093), crosslinking moieties (WO 2000/027860), ligands for Diels-Alder-type conjugation (WO 2013/036748, US20130066063), and other ligands (WO 2011/126937, 2006/125447, WO 9622297, U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,020, U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,398).
Those skilled in the art know that reagents derived from vicinal diols share one common disadvantage. Upon attachment of the reagent to the terminus of a synthetic oligonucleotide, one of the vicinal hydroxy functions becomes connected to said oligonucleotide via a phosphotriester moiety. When the oligonucleotide synthesis starts from said non-nucleosidic solid support, the other hydroxy function is connected to the solid phase material via an ester group. During the final deprotection of the oligonucleotides (under strong basic conditions), said ester function is cleaved simultaneously and competitively with 2-cyanoethyl protecting group of the phosphate. The hydroxy group released by the cleavage of the ester may attack the phosphotriester moiety, which results in the loss of the non-nucleosidic moiety together with the phosphate group from the oligonucleotide. In other words, the solid supports of this kind work, to an extent, as universal solid supports of low efficiency. Examples of universal solid supports of similar structures and their use in oligonucleotide chemistry have been disclosed, for instance, in WO 95/01987 and in Reddy, M. P., Hanna, N. B., and Farooqui, F. Fast cleavage and deprotection of oligonucleotides. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 4311-4314.
When phosphoramidite building blocks of this group are attached at the 5'-terminus of oligonucleotides, the purity of the deprotected products depends on whether the 5'-terminal DMT group was present in the oligonucleotides when the basic deprotection was carried out. The deprotection of the 5'-DMT-protected oligonucleotides results in less complex reaction mixtures. In contrast, oligonucleotides having the free pseudo-5'-hydroxy group suffer, to an extent, from the loss of the non-nucleosidic moiety in a manner similar to that described above.
Alternatively, an amino group of 3-amino-1,2-propanediol (aminoglycerol) may serve as a point of attachment of a ligand by acylation with an appropriate carboxylic acid. A number of phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports constructed in this manner have been disclosed, for example, bearing protected amino groups (WO 2005/103247, WO 2015/113776, U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,091, U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,813), tertiary amino groups (WO 97/28168, WO 95/18820, U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,398, U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,391, U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,177), protected aminooxy groups (WO 2002/094185, U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,805), protected carboxylate functions (WO 95/18820, U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,177, U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,391), protected mercapto groups (WO 2003/074510), esters of phenylboronic acid (U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,117, U.S. Pat. No. 6,013,783), hydrophobic motifs (WO 2015/091958), intercalators and fluorescent labels (WO 2010/001902, WO 2009/007397, WO 95/18820, U.S. Pat. No. 5,886,177, U.S. Pat. No. 5,698,391), chelating moieties (EP 1308452), N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues (WO 2015/006740), and unnatural nucleic bases (WO 2011/133876).
In the course of the final deprotection, oligonucleotides assembled using phosphoramidites and/or solid supports derived from N-acylaminoglycerol suffer from lower yields due to major side reactions (Petrie, C. R., Reed, M. W., Adams, A. D., and Meyer, R. B. Jr. An improved CPG support for the synthesis of 3'-amine-tailed oligonucleotides. Bioconjug. Chem. 1992, 3, 85-87; Reed, M. W., Adams, A. D., Nelson, J. S., and Meyer, R. B. Jr. 1991. Acridine- and cholesterol-derivatized solid supports for improved synthesis of 3'-modified oligonucleotides. Bioconjug. Chem. 1991, 2, 217-225; Thaden, J. and Miller, P. S. Automated synthesis of oligodeoxyribonucleosidemethylphosphonates having [N-(3-aminoprop-1-yl-)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl-)-2-aminoethyl] phosphate or methylphosphonic acid at the 3'-end using a modified controlled pore glass support. Bioconjug. Chem. 1993, 4, 395-401; Vu, H., Joyce, N., Rieger, M., Walker, D., Goldknopf, I., Hill, T. S., Jayaraman, K., and Mulvey, D. Use of phthaloyl protecting group for the automated synthesis of 3'-[(hydroxypropyl)amino] and 3'-[(hydroxypropyltriglycyl] oligonucleotide conjugates. Bioconjug. Chem. 1995, 6, 599-607).
First, the loss of the linker together with the adjacent phosphate may occur in a manner similar to that disclosed for reagents derived from glycerol. With the appropriate protection of one of the hydroxy groups and the amino function, this side reaction may become the main process that is used in commercial Universal Solid Supports disclosed in WO 2008/049972 and WO 2002/044398.
The second major side reaction is typical for N-acylated aminoethanols and results in the intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the oxygen of the amido group on the carbon attached to the oxygen of the P-O fragment as disclosed in (Guzaev, A. P. and Manoharan, M. 2-Benzamidoethyl Group-a Novel Type of Phosphate Protecting Group for Oligodeoxynucleotide Synthesis. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 783-793; Guzaev, A. P. and Manoharan, M. A Novel Phosphate Protection for Oligonucleotide Synthesis: the 2-[(1-Naphthyl)carbamoyloxy]ethyl (NCE) Group. Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 5623-5626). The process results in the loss of the linker with the formation of oligonucleotides bearing 3'-terminal phosphate group. Once the non-nucleosidic linker is attached, said side reaction may occur at all steps: in the course of the chain assembly of oligonucleotides and during the final deprotection.
The disadvantages of non-nucleosidic building blocks and solid supports derived from 1,2-diol systems were partially addressed in reagents derived from 1,3-diols. One family of reagents has been derived either from glycerol or from 2-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-1,3-propanediol wherein one of the primary hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection while the other served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety.
In the glycerol family, the secondary hydroxy group was either protected or bore a side chain terminated by modifiers of interest. Reagents have been disclosed in the art bearing nucleic bases (WO 2008/147824, WO 2003/004602), protected residues of monosaccharides (U.S. Pat. No. 9,290,531), or protected hydroxy groups (WO 2012/119846, WO 2011/060379).
Derived from 2-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-1,3-propanediol backbone, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring protected amino groups (WO 98/53316, WO 97/28168, U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,711, U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,091, U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,398,&U.S. Pat. No. 5,696,251, U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,744, U.S. Pat. No. 5,585,481), lipoic acid (US Patent Appl. 2014/0142253), acridin (U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,487), fluorescein (WO 2015/109136, WO 2015/091958, WO 2015/091953, WO 2011/087707, WO 95/32739), fluorescence quenchers (WO 2003/019145), and biotin (WO 2012/085064, WO 2012/085069, U.S. Pat. No. 6,326,487).
The main disadvantage of the disclosed reagents is that 1-O,3-O-unsymmetrically substituted 2-derivatized 1,3-propanediols, unless stereochemically resolved, exist as mixtures of enantiomers and hence embed the unwanted stereo-heterogeneity in modified oligonucleotides.
Yet another group of reagents derived from 2-substituted 1,3-diols featured the core structures of serinol (2-amino-1,3-propanediol) and threoninol (2-amino-1,3-butanediol) wherein the primary hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection while the other, either primary (serinol) or secondary (threoninol) hydroxy group served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety. The primary amino group was either protected or was acylated to bear a side chain terminated by modifiers of interest. Both serinol and threoninol, the starting materials for manufacturing of these reagents, are produced from the respective natural amino acids and hence are expensive.
In addition, as disclosed in a web-site of the Assignee of U.S. Pat. No. 8,394,948 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,945,515, oligonucleotides incorporating these building blocks suffer from a side reaction unless stored at −20° C. (http://www.glenresearch.com/ProductFiles/Product.php?item=10-1996). Similar to all oligonucleotides prepared using reagents incorporating a fragment of N-acyl aminoethanol, oligonucleotides derivatized with serinol and threoninol-based reagents may suffer from the loss of the linker accompanied by the release of the terminally phosphorylated oligonucleotides as disclosed above for aminoglycerol. Although substantially more expensive, threoninol reagents display two advantages over serinol counterparts: the ease of synthetic preparation due to the distinctly different hydroxy groups in the starting material and, when chirally pure threoninol is used, stereohomogeneity of oligonucleotide products.
Derived from serinol backbone, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring protected amino groups (WO 2015/113776, WO 2015/006740, WO 2014/178082, WO 97/28168, WO 96/32841, WO 96/31523, WO 96/22297, U.S. Pat. No. 8,394,948, U.S. Pat. No. 6,008,398, U.S. Pat. No. 5,997,861), reactive double (U.S. Pat. No. 7,705,136) and triple bonds (WO 2015/012912), cholesterol (WO 94/04550) and other hydrophobic residues (WO 2008/141799), intercalators (WO 2006/088490), fluorescein and biotin (U.S. Pat. No. 8,394,948), and negative charges formed by carboxylic (WO 2008/141799) and boronic acids (U.S. Pat. No. 6,031,117).
Derived from threoninol backbone, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring protected amino groups (WO 2015/006740), photocrosslinkers (WO 2015/064718, WO 2014/157565), hydrophobic residues (WO 2011/105610), intercalators (WO 2012/029434, WO 2011/105610, WO 2010/147673, WO 2010/071852, WO 2005/083073), and fluorescein (U.S. Pat. No. 7,026,114) and other fluorescent labels (WO 2009/007397).
Yet another group of reagents derived from 1,3-diols feature the core structures of 2-(aminomethyl)-1,3-propanediol and 2-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-1,3-propanediol wherein the primary hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection while the other, secondary, hydroxy group served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety. One of the disadvantages of these reagents is that, unless stereochemically resolved, they embed the unwanted stereo-heterogeneity in modified oligonucleotides.
In 2-(aminomethyl)-1,3-propanediol, the primary amino group was acylated to bear a side chain terminated by a trifluoroacetyl-protected primary amino group (WO 94/19364). Similar to all oligonucleotides prepared using reagents incorporating a fragment of N-acyl aminoethanol, oligonucleotides derivatized with 2-(aminomethyl)-1,3-propanediol-based reagents may suffer from the loss of the linker accompanied by the release of the terminally phosphorylated oligonucleotides as disclosed above for aminoglycerol.
Derived from the backbone of 2-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-1,3-propanediol, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring protected amino groups (WO 2001/084234, U.S. Pat. No. 7,427,678), a DMT-protected hydroxy group (WO 2008/073959), constrained alkynes (WO 2013/036748), 2-nitrophenyl residue (WO 2010/151714, WO 2008/157696, EP 1333101), folic acid (WO 2012/018729), and residues of carbazoles, dibenzofurans, 3-Ph-adamantane, quinolone, and acridine capable of soliciting immune response (WO 95/03296 WO 95/0329, WO 94/29329, WO 93/20094, U.S. Pat. No. 5,464,746).
A number of phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports disclosed in the art have been derived from cyclic structures. One structural motif widely appreciated by skilled artisans is that of 2'-deoxy-β-D-ribose present in natural nucleosides. Similar to nucleosidic building blocks, the primary 5'-hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection, while the secondary 3'-hydroxy group served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety or the succinate linker. The side chain to bear modifiers of interest was attached either by glycosidation via a 1'-O position or directly via the C-1' carbon. The preparation of both types of reagents requires a multi-step synthesis and is labor-intensive, which precluded said reagents from commercial success.
Derived from the backbone of 1'-O-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-2'-deoxy-β-D-ribose, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring intercalators (WO 2004/019002), hydrophobic groups (WO 2014/147095), positively-charged groups (WO 2015/132577), crosslinkers (WO 90/12020, U.S. Pat. No. 9,267,171), allyl (WO 2009/074076) and 2-nitrobenzyl (WO 94/06815) groups.
Derived from the backbone of 1',2'-dideoxy-1'-(ω-functionalized alkyl)-β-D-ribose, phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports have been disclosed featuring intercalators anthracene, phenanthrene, pyrene, tetracene, and pentacene (WO 97/43298), stilbene (WO 2001/044220 WO 2001/044220 WO 2004/019002, WO 97/43298), and fluorescein (EP 967217).
Yet another group of reagents derived from 1,3-diols feature the core structure of 1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)-4-aminocyclohexane wherein the primary hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection while the other hydroxy group served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety or the succinate linker. The primary amino group was acylated to bear a side chain terminated by a trifluoroacetyl-protected primary amino group (WO 97/43451), fluorescein (EP 1431298, EP 1431297, WO 97/43451, U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,467), and biotin (WO 97/43451). The preparation of said reagents requires a multi-step synthesis and is labor-intensive. Another disadvantage thereof is that, unless stereochemically resolved, the unwanted stereo-heterogeneity is embedded in the modified oligonucleotides.
Yet another group of reagents of the type of cyclic 1,3-diols has been derived from the core structure of hydroxyprolinol wherein the primary hydroxy groups bore the DMT protection while the other hydroxy group served for the attachment of a phosphoramidite moiety or the succinate linker. The secondary amino group was acylated to bear a side chain terminated by a protected primary amino group (WO 2015/006740, WO 2011/087707, WO 2003/104249), protected polyamines (WO 2009/126933), alkyne (WO 2010/039548, WO 2011/100131), azobenzene WO 2011/087707, WO 2005/043127, WO 2002/099141, WO 2001/042505) fluorescein (WO 2007/098336), folic acid (WO 2009/082606), various mono- and oligosaccharides (WO 2015/168589, WO 2015/168618, WO 2015/168635, WO 2015/042447, WO 2015/006740, WO 2014/179626, WO 2014/179620, WO 2014/179620, WO 2009/073809), various compounds bound via a disulfide linkage (WO 2009/126933, U.S. Pat. No. 8,017,762, U.S. Pat. No. 7,745,608).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS
The present invention provides chemical preparations of oligonucleotides, chemical entities useful in such preparation, and processes for such preparation. More specifically, the invention provides novel non-nucleosidic phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports for incorporation of a variety of useful ligands to natural oligonucleotides and their phosphorothioate analogs in the course of synthesis on solid phase. The phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports according to the invention are highly efficient. These compounds are inexpensive to manufacture. They are stable in the solid state or in solution over an extensive period of time. The attachment thereof to oligonucleotides does not create any new chiral centers and hence does not complicate the isolation of the ligand-modified oligonucleotides. Said oligonucleotides do not suffer from any unwanted side reactions. The patents and publications cited in this specification are well-known to those skilled in the art and are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.
Upon examination of the data disclosed in the prior art, skilled artisans will appreciate the fact that, in order to eliminate side reactions in modified oligonucleotides, an optimal structure for preparation of such oligonucleotides should be derived from 1,3-propanediol or a longer α,ω-alkanediol and that a functional group to serve as an attachment point for ligands of interest should be at least 4 carbons away from any of the hydroxy groups. Further, to avoid the formation of new chiral centers in such modified oligonucleotides, the optimal linker should not possess any chiral or pro-chiral centers.

Certain starting materials used in the present invention are protected nucleoside phosphoramidites readily available from commercial sources (Glen Research, Sterling, Va., ChemGenes, Inc., Waltham, Mass.; Rasayan, Inc., Encinitas, Calif.). 3,3-Bis(hydroxymethyl)azetidine hydrochloride, p/n AZB30083 can be purchased from A2Z Chemicals (Irvine, Calif.).
Commercial compound 1 was first reacted with aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of a catalytic amount of K2CO3 to form a product of aldol addition 2, which was, without isolation, reduced to a diol 2. To remove the Boc protection, the latter was treated with an anhydrous
solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane to give a hydrochloride of 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)piperidine 3.
N-acylated 4,4-bis(hydroxymethyl)piperidines 5a-5k and 3,3-bis(hydroxymethyl)azetidines 6a-6k (FIG. 1; see Table 1 for the structures of radicals R) were next obtained by the selective acylation of compounds 3 and 4, respectively, at the amino group with the respective carboxylic acids activated with HOBT and EDC-HCl.
The obtained compounds 5a-5k and 6a-6k were selectively protected at one of the hydroxy groups by treating with either DMT-Cl or TMT-Cl in pyridine to give compounds 7a-7k, 8a-8k, 9a-9k, and 10a-10k. These were directly converted to phosphoramidite building blocks 11a-11k, 12a-12k, 13a-13k, and 14a-14k by the action of 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N'N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole and, by treating with succinic anhydride in pyridine, to hemisuccinate esters 15a-15k, 16a-16k, 17a-17k, and 18a-18k. The hemisuccinate esters were, upon activation with TBTU, attached to solid phase materials, aminopropyl-derivatized CPG and aminomethylated MPPS to give solid supports 19a-19k, 20a-20k, 21a-21k, and 22a-22k for the 3'-derivatization of synthetic oligonucleotides.
In order to obtain phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports with an extended side chain, Fmoc protecting group in compounds 7a, 8a, 9a, and 10a was removed first by treatment with piperidine in methanol to give compounds 23, 24, 25, and 26 followed by the selective acylation of the latter compounds at their amino group with the respective carboxylic acids upon activation of the latter with HOBT and EDC-HCl (FIG. 2; see Table 1 for the structures of radicals R2). The compounds 27a-27p, 28a-28p, 29a-29p, and 30a-30p thus obtained were converted to the respective phosphoramidite building blocks 31a-31p, 32a-32p, 33a-33p, and 34a-34p by the action of 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N'N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole and, by treating with succinic anhydride in pyridine, to hemisuccinate esters 35a-35p, 36a-36p, 37a-37p, and 38a-38p. The hemisuccinate esters were, upon activation with TBTU, attached to solid phase materials, aminopropyl-derivatized CPG and aminomethylated MPPS to give solid supports 39a-39p, 40a-40p, 41a-41p, and 42a-42p for the 3'-derivatization of synthetic oligonucleotides.
To obtain phosphoramidite building blocks and solid supports derivatized with Dabsyl group at the side chain, compounds 19-22 were first sulfonylated at the amino function by treating with Dabsyl chloride in the presence of TEA (FIG. 3; see Table 1 for the structures of radicals R2). The compounds 43k, 44k, 45k, and 46k thus obtained were converted to the respective phosphoramidite building blocks 47k, 48k, 49k, and 50k by the action of 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N'N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole and, by treating with succinic anhydride in pyridine, to hemisuccinate esters 51k, 52k, 53k, and 54k. The hemisuccinate esters were, upon activation with TBTU, attached to solid phase materials, aminopropyl-derivatized CPG and aminomethylated MPPS to give solid supports 55k, 56k, 57k, and 58k for the 3'-derivatization of synthetic oligonucleotides.
To afford synthetic tools for introduction of D-biotin into synthetic oligonucleotides, phosphoramidite building blocks 63 and 64 and solid supports 67, 68 were synthesized (FIG. 4). Compounds 7c and 8c were treated with piperidine in methanol, which removed the Fmoc protection. The released amino group of compounds 59 and 60 was acylated with N-protected D-biotin using TBTU as a coupling reagent to give compounds 61 and 62. These were converted to phosphoramidite building blocks 63 and 64 by the action of 2-cyanoethyl N,N,N'N'-tetraisopropylphosphorodiamidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole and to the respective hemisuccinates 65 and 66 by treating with succinic anhydride in pyridine. The hemisuccinate esters 65 and 66 were, upon activation with TBTU, attached to solid phase materials, aminopropyl-derivatized CPG and aminomethylated MPPS to give solid supports 67 and 68 for the 3'-derivatization of synthetic oligonucleotides with biotin.
The utility of a ureido linkage for construction of non-nucleosidic phosphoramidites and solid supports was demonstrated by synthesis of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-derivatized phosphoramidite building blocks 71 and 76 and solid supports 74 and 78 as disclosed in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6.

A mixture of conc. aqueous ammonium hydroxide with 40% aqueous methylamine (1:1) for 15 min at 65° C.4. Treatment with a mixture of diethylamine and acetonitrile (5:1) for 3 min followed by acetonitrile wash and final deprotection with a solution of ethylenediamine in toluene (1:1) for 2 h at room temperature, acetonitrile wash, and eltion of the product with water.5. 50 mM K2CO3 in methanol at room temperature.Crude reaction mixtures were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC and by ES MS to demonstrate that the non-nucleosidic moieties were stable under all tested conditions except for 50 mM K2CO3 in methanol.
Accordingly, the efficient preparation of analogs of oligonucleotides modified with ligands of practical interest and their phosphorothioate analogs using the novel non-nucleosidic solid supports and phosphoramidite building blocks described herein has been demonstrated. Said solid supports and phosphoramidite building blocks can be readily synthesized by artisans possessing ordinary skills. Conveniently, oligonucleotide analogs synthesized using said solid supports and phosphoramidite building blocks are stable under the most common basic deprotection conditions and do not possess any additional stereoheterogeneity.
