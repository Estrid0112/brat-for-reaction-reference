TECHNICAL FIELD
The present specification claims priority to and the benefits of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2015-0130356, filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Sep. 15, 2015, and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0090117, filed with the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Jul. 15, 2016, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.
The present specification relates to a heterocyclic compound and an organic light emitting device including the same.
BACKGROUND ART
An organic light emission phenomenon generally refers to a phenomenon converting electrical energy to light energy using an organic material. An organic light emitting device using an organic light emission phenomenon normally has a structure including an anode, a cathode, and an organic material layer therebetween. Herein, the organic material layer is often formed in a multilayer structure formed with different materials in order to increase efficiency and stability of the organic light emitting device, and for example, may be formed with a hole injection layer, a hole transfer layer, a light emitting layer, an electron transfer layer, an electron injection layer and the like. When a voltage is applied between the two electrodes in such an organic light emitting device structure, holes and electrons are injected to the organic material layer from the anode and the cathode, respectively, and when the injected holes and electrons meet, excitons are formed, and light emits when these excitons fall back to the ground state.
Development of new materials for such an organic light emitting device has been continuously required.

<OLED Device Manufacture and Evaluation>
Comparative Example 1
A glass substrate on which indium tin oxide (ITO) was coated as a thin film to a thickness of 1,500 Å was placed in detergent-dissolved distilled water and ultrasonic cleaned. Herein, a product of Fischer Co. was used as the detergent, and as the distilled water, distilled water filtered twice with a filter manufactured by Millipore Co. was used. After the ITO was cleaned for 30 minutes, ultrasonic cleaning was repeated twice using distilled water for 10 minutes. After the cleaning with distilled water was finished, the substrate was ultrasonic cleaned with solvents of isopropyl alcohol, acetone and methanol, then dried, and then transferred to a plasma cleaner. A hole injection layer was formed on the substrate by thermal vacuum depositing hexanitrile hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) of the following chemical formula for 5 minutes to a thickness of 100 Å using oxygen plasma.
A hole transfer layer was formed on the hole injection layer by consecutively vacuum depositing 4-4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) of the following chemical formula (700 Å), hexanitrile hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) (50 Å) and 4-4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (NPB) (700 Å).

Subsequently, a light emitting layer was formed on the hole transfer layer to a film thickness of 200 Å by vacuum depositing H1 and D1 shown below in a weight ratio of 25:1. An electron transfer layer was formed on the light emitting layer to a thickness of 100 Å of E1.

An electron injection and electron transfer layer was formed on the electron transfer layer to a thickness of 200 Å by vacuum depositing E1 and E2 in a weight ratio of 1:1. A cathode was formed on the electron injection and transfer layer by depositing lithium fluoride (LiF) to a thickness of 15 Å and aluminum to a thickness of 2,000 Å in consecutive order.
An organic light emitting device was manufactured by maintaining, in the above-mentioned processes, the deposition rates of the organic materials at 0.4 Å/sec to 0.7 Å/sec, the deposition rates of the lithium fluoride and the aluminum of the cathode at 0.3 Å/sec and 2 Å/sec, respectively, and the degree of vacuum during the deposition at 2×10−7 torr to 5×10−8 torr.
