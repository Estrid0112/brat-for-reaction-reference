BACKGROUND
Field
This disclosure generally relates to photo-stable highly luminescent chromophores which are useful in various applications.
Description of the Related Art
In recent years, with the need for new optical light collection systems, fluorescence-based solar collectors, fluorescence-activated displays, and single-molecule spectroscopy, various approaches for preparing luminescent chromophores have been explored. However, many technical issues have yet to be overcome.
One of the useful properties of fluorescence (or photo-luminescent) dyes is that they have the ability to absorb light of a particular wavelength and re-emit light of a different wavelength. This phenomenon also makes them useful in the photovoltaic industry. There has been very little work reported on the use of photo-luminescent organic mediums for efficiency improvements in photovoltaic devices. The use of anl organic medium, as opposed to an inorganic medium, is attractive in that organic materials are typically cheaper and easier to use, making them a better economical choice. However, most of the currently available organic luminescent dyes are typically not photo-stable for long periods of time, and therefore unusable in photovoltaic applications which require consistent performance for more than 20 years.
The use of luminescent dyes in greenhouse roofing materials to alter the incident solar spectrum plants are exposed to within a greenhouse has also been attempted. However, the disclosed systems lack efficiency and stability. For instance, current systems lose a large amount of the emitted light to the polymeric or glass matrix which encapsulates the dyes. Also, the stability of the dyes is poor and the dyes often degrade quickly, especially when exposed to UV light.
Because of high cost and low efficiency/stability, there remains an unmet need for dyes that improve plant growth, are photostable, and can be used to improve solar energy harvesting simultaneously.

wherein: D is optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted heteroaryl; and R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, and R6 are independently optionally substituted phenyl, optionally substituted naphthyl, or optionally substituted heterocyclyl. These compounds may be used in wavelength conversion materials, films, or layers for use or conversion of solar energy, such as conversion of solar energy into electricity, or use in greenhouses or other buildings.
Further aspects, features and advantages of this disclosure will become apparent from the detailed description of the preferred embodiments which follow.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Bis-triazole chromophores having a unique combination of pentaerythritol and phenols photo-protective groups may have increased the photostability up to ten fold higher than without the photoprotective groups.
Chromophore structures of formula I have been shown to have up to ten times higher photo-stability than their analogs with simpler alkyl groups at N-2 and N-6. Spectral data (red shifts of the absorption and emission bands) and shifts of the NMR signals indicate that there may be strong interaction by p-p stacking between the chromophore core and aryloxy groups attached to the pentaerythrityl linker. This may allow shielding of the core against harmful radicals formed during exposure of the material to visible light. Depending on the environment and nature of the groups X, the equilibrium shown below may be shifted more or less to the right. For example, in glass encapsulated PVB matrix, some of these chromophores showed no degradation at all at up to 1000 h exposure time to light with intensity of 1 sun. This allows use of these chromophores in wavelength conversion films for numerous applications, including solar cell energy harvesting and agriculture (greenhouse roofing) materials, building and vehicle materials, etc.

One of the useful properties of fluorescent (or photo-luminescent) dyes is that they have the ability to absorb light of a particular wavelength, and re-emit light at a different wavelength. This phenomenon also makes them useful in several applications, including the photovoltaic industry and agriculture industry. In order for organic chromophores to be useful in these industries they require high quantum yield and good photostability. Surprisingly, the inventors have discovered chromophores comprising a benzotriazole system using unique combination of pentaerythritol and phenols that increase the photostability ten-fold higher than without the photoprotective groups. The fluorophores, as disclosed herein, can absorb green light at about 450 to about 600 nm and emit red light at about 600 to about 700 nm.
The chromophores represented by general formula I are useful for absorbing green light and emiting red light. These chromophores are useful as fluorescent dyes in various applications, including in wavelength conversion films.

Step 1
A solution of 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrobromide (2.3 g, 5 mmol) in 50 mL of 48% HBr was placed in a 500 mL round bottomed flask, and it was stirred and cooled in an ice-water bath (approx. 0-5° C.). A solution of NaNO2 (5.25 g in 100 mL of water) was added dropwise over a period of 2 h. After the addition, the reaction mixture was kept at 0° C. for an additional 1 h and then removed from the cooling bath and heated at 90-100° C. for 3 h. The mixture was set aside overnight for slow crystallization. The grayish-brown solid was separated, washed with water and dried to give Compound a, 4,8-dibromo-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole), (139 g, 86% yield).
Step 2
A mixture of Compound a (13.4 g, 42 mmol), 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (17.5 g, 126 mmol, 3 eq.) and 4-toluenesulfonic acid (200 mg) in toluene was heated at reflux under Dean-Stark trap for 16 h, After cooling, the toluene solution was decanted from an oily layer formed on the flask bottom. The oily layer was triturated first with hexane and then with methanol to wash out an excess of benzyl alcohol. The brown solid obtained was separated, washed with methanol and dissolved in DCM (as little as possible to get clear solution). Diethyl ether was then added portion wise, while stirring, until crystals started to form, and the mixture was left for crystallization. The obtained yellow solid was separated, washed with ether and dried to give Compound b, 4,8-dibromo-1,6-bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole) (20.50 g, 87% yield) as a mixture of Bt-2-Bt-2 and Bt-2-Bt-1 isomers.
Step 3
Compound b (6.7 g, 12 mmol) in a mixture of solvents (toluene/EtOH/2M-Na2CO3, 3:2:1 by volume, total volume 150 mL) was treated with 4-(diphenylamino)phenylboronic acid (10.4 g, 35 mmol) and tetrakis-triphenylphosphine-Pd(0) (2.00 g, 1.75 mmol) and heated with stirring at 100° C. Progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. When all the starting material was consumed (about 2 h), the mixture was cooled down to room temperature and transferred to a separator funnel. The top organic layer was separated, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and subjected directly to fast column chromatography-“wash trough” 2 in of silica gel in a 3.5 in diameter column. DCM was used as solvent. The first few fractions with blue fluorescence have been discarded, and only red and orange colored fractions with strong fluorescence have been collected (approx. 1.5 L). After evaporation of the solvent, red solid (7.50 g, 70% yield) consisting of three isomers of Compound c, 4,4'-(1,6-bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline), was obtained.
Step 4
A solution of Compound c (7.50 g, 8.4 mmol), 1,3-dimethoxybenzene (6.0 mL) and methanesulfonic acid (3.0 mL) in toluene (50 mL) was heated at 125° C. (temp. of oil bath) for 30 min. After cooling, the dark toluene layer was decanted, and the sticky oily residue was triturated with water. Soon brownish solid was formed. The solid was separated, stirred with methanol (20 mL), filtered off, washed with methanol, and dried to give Compound A, 4,4'-(1,6-Dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(N,N-diphenylaniline), as orange-brown solid (4.6 g, 83% yield) that was used for derivatization without further purification. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 8.0-8.2 (bs, 2H), 7.93 (s, 4H), 7.26-7.30 (m, 8H), 7.17 (d, J 8.8 Hz, 4H), 7.13 (d, J=7.7 Hz, 8H), 7.04 (t, J=7.3 Hz, 4H).

Step 1
A mixture of Compound b (2.23 g, 4.0 mmol), (9-ethyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)boronic acid (2.4 g, 10 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) catalyst (600 mg), 2M Na2CO3 (12 mL), toluene (36 mL), and ethanol (24 mL) was stirred under nitrogen at 110° C. for 5 h. After TLC confirmed that the starting material was consumed, the reaction mixture was cooled and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The extract was washed with water (100 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give 40 g of a glassy orange material, which was purified by column chromatography to give Compound c2, 3,3'-(1,6-bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole), (2.10 g, 67% yield) as a mixture of two isomers (Bt-2-Bt-2 red color and Bt-2-Bt-1 orange color).
Step 2
Compound c2 (2.10 g, 2.7 mmol) was reacted with methanesulfonic acid (1.0 mL) in a mixture of toluene (20 mL) and 1,3-dimethoxybenzene (2.0 mL) at 125° C. for 30 min. After cooling, the reaction mixture was poured into saturated NaHCO3 (100 mL) and stirred for 15 min. The obtained solid was separated by filtration, dried and purified by column chromatography (DCM→DCM-2.5% EA) to give pure Compound A2, 3,3'-(1,6-Dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole), (420 mg, 30%).

Step 1
3,6-Dibromocarbazole (32.5 g, 100 mmol) was reacted with isobutyl tosylate (22.8 g, 100 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) in the presence of K2CO3 (27.6 g, 200 mmol) at 100° C. for 24 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (500 mL) to give white precipitate. The solid was filtered off, washed with water (100 mL) and recrystallized from methanol to give pure 3,6-dibromo-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole (32.5 g, 85% yield). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.12 (d, J=1.8 Hz, 2H), 7.54 (dd, J=1.8 and 8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.25 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H), 4.02 d (J=7.3 Hz, 2H), 2.29 (m, 1H), 0.94 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 6H).
Step 2
3,6-Dibromo-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole (7.6 g, 20 mmol) was reacted with 4-isobutoxy-phenylboronic acid (3.88 g, 20 mmol) in the presence of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(0) in a mixture of toluene, ethanol and 2M Na2CO3 (60-40-20 mL) at 110° C. for 16 h. After cooling, the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (300 mL), washed with water (200 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of the residue with DCM/hexane (1:3) afforded 3-bromo-6-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole as white powder (1.8 g, 20% yield). 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 8.23 (d, J=1.8 Hz, 1H), 8.18 (d, J=1.8 Hz, 1H), 7.66 (dd, J=1.8 Hz and 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.59 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.52 (dd, J=1.8 Hz and 8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.41 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.27 (d, J=8.4 Hz, 1H), 7.00 (d, J=8.8 Hz, 2H), 4.07 (d, J=7.7 Hz, 2H), 3.78 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 2H), 2.37 (m, 1H), 2.12 (m, 1H), 1.05 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 6H), 0.97 (d, J=6.6 Hz, 6H).
Step 3
The boronic acid was prepared under standard conditions: first lithiation of 3-bromo-6-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole in THF with n-BuLi (1.6 M solution in hexane, 1.05 eq) at −78° C. and then reaction with trimethyl borate (1.1 eq, also at −78° C.). The reaction mixture was left overnight to warm-up to room temperature, and then it was treated with 3M HCl, 1 ml/1 mmol and stirred for 30 min. Extraction with ethyl acetate, drying (MgSO4) and removal of the solvent under reduce pressure gave a glassy product, 6-(4-Isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)boronic acid, that was used directly for the next step without purification.
Step 4
Reaction of 4,8-dibromo-1,6-bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole) (Compound b, 560 mg, 1 mmol) was treated with (6-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)boronic acid (1.25 g, 3 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium(0) (150 mg) under Suzuki coupling conditions at 110° C. for 4 h. Work-up with water and DCM. Column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of DCM and hexane as a mobile phase (1:1→2:1→DCM) allowed to separate Bt-2-Bt-2 isomer as the first fraction, dark red color solid (50 mg). A mixture of other isomers was isolated as the second fraction, dark orange color solid Compound c3, 6,6'-(1,6-Bis(4-methoxybenzyl)-1,6-dihydrobenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,2,3]triazole)-4,8-diyl)bis(3-(4-isobutoxyphenyl)-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole), (620 mg).

In an embodiment, a wavelength conversion film which comprises a chromophore, and an optically transparent polymer matrix, is fabricated by (i) preparing a 15 wt % Ethyl-methyl methacrylate (EMMA) (from Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.; and used as received) polymer solution with dissolved polymer powder in cyclopentanone; (ii) preparing a chromophore containing an EMMA matrix by mixing the EMMA polymer solution with the synthesized CE-22 at a weight ratio (CE-22/EMMA) of 0.3 wt %, to obtain a chromophore-containing polymer solution; (iii) stirring the solution for approximately 30 min; (iv) then forming the chromophore/polymer film by directly drop casting the dye-containing polymer solution onto a substrate, then allowing the film to dry at room temperature over night followed by heat treating the film at 60° C. under vacuum for 10 min, to completely remove the remaining solvent, and (v) hot pressing the dry composition under vacuum to form a bubble free film with film thickness of approximately 200 □m.
Measurement of the Photostability
The Comparative Example 1 wavelength conversion film, was exposed to continuous one sun (AM1.5 G) irradiation at ambient temperature. The absorption peak of the wavelength conversion film was measured using a UV-Vis spectrometer prior to exposure, and then again after 100 h. The initial UV-Vis absorption data was normalized to its absorption peak maximum so that at 0 hours, the peak intensity is 100%. The UV-Vis measurements after exposure to one sun are then normalized to the initial 0 hour data, and the absorption peak intensity is reported as the photostability. Easily degraded films typically show a drastic decay of the absorption peak within a few hours of one sun irradiation. Films with excellent photostability will maintain the peak absorption over a long time period of exposure to one sun irradiation. Table 1 shows the photostability of the wavelength conversion films that were fabricated, where the data is normalized to the Comparative Example 1 film.
Example 2
A wavelength conversion film was prepared in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1 except that Compound 10 was used instead of CE-22. The measured photostability of the wavelength conversion film was 5.3× higher than the Comparative Example 1 film.
Example 3
A wavelength conversion film was prepared in the same manner as in Comparative Example 1 except that Compound 3 was used instead of CE-22. The measured photostability of the wavelength conversion film was 12.4× higher than the Comparative Example 1 film.

It has been discovered that the chromophore derivatives, as disclosed herein, can be combined with a polymer matrix to form an organic down-shifting luminescent medium, which is significantly higher photostability compared to previously reported chomophores. Surprisingly, the unique combination of pentaerythritol and phenol substituents increase the photostability greater than 2×, greater than 5×, or greater than 10×. This allows these chromophores to be utilized in applications requiring long lifetimes.
