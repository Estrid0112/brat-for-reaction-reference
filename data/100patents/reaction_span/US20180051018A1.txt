TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a quinuclidine derivative, and to a medicament containing the quinuclidine derivative.
BACKGROUND ART
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a generic term for diseases that have been conventionally called chronic bronchitis or emphysema. COPD is a chronic disease of the lungs, which is caused by long-term inhalation exposure of harmful substances mainly containing tobacco smoke, and is said to be a lifestyle-related disease that occurs in middle-aged or older people against the background of smoking habit.
In the drug therapy for COPD, a bronchodilator (an anticholinergic drug, a β2-agonist, or a theophylline drug) is mainly used, and an inhaled anticholinergic drug or an inhaled β2-agonist that mainly dilates the bronchi for a long time is used. In addition, an inhaled corticosteroid is used in severe cases.
In recent years, as a drug effective for the treatment of COPD, for example, a quinuclidine derivative as a muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist (Patent Literature 1), N-phenylbenzamide having a bronchodilation effect (Patent Literature 2), and a substance that inhibits the production or accumulation of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans as an emphysema inhibitor (Patent Literature 3), have been reported.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problem
However, although the quinuclidine derivative and the N-phenylbenzamide have some degree of the long-term bronchodilation effect, it cannot be said at present that they have a sufficient therapeutic effect on COPD.
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound having an excellent therapeutic effect on COPD.
Solution to Problem
Therefore, the present inventors have studied to develop a novel therapeutic drug for COPD, and have extensively studied based on the findings that a drug having only the long-term bronchodilation effect is not sufficient as the therapeutic drug for COPD, and a drug having a suppressive effect on chronic inflammation of the lungs together with the long-term bronchodilation effect is useful for COPD. As a result, the present inventors have found that a compound represented by the following general formula (1) has a long-term bronchodilation effect lasting longer than that of the compound described in Patent Literature 1, and further suppresses inflammation of the lungs, therefore, is particularly useful as a therapeutic drug for COPD; and thus have completed the present invention.
That is, the present invention provides the following [1] to [12].

EXAMPLES
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail by way of Examples.
Test Example 1 (Human M3 Receptor Antagonist Activity)
Measurement of the receptor binding ability was performed by using a transgenic human M3 receptor expression CHO cell membrane, 1-[N-methyl-3H] scopolamine methyl bromide ([3H]NMS, specific activity of 82 Cimmol). Protein concentration of the cell membrane was 2 μg per well, concentration of the [3H]NMS was 1.0 nM.
Range of the antagonist concentration (10−4 to 10−11 M) was tested by creating a comparison curve. Unspecific binding was measured in the presence of 1 μM of atropine.
The reagent was adjusted to a total volume of 100 μL with a binding buffer (phosphate buffer/saline). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 hours so as to reach equilibrium, and then the resultant mixture was transplanted to a GF/C filter plate that had been pretreated with a washing buffer containing 0.05% polyethyleneimine for 1 hour.
The bound [3H]NMS and the free[3H]NMS were separated by rapid vacuum filtration, and washed three times with a rinse buffer (50 mM of Tris, 100 mM of saline, and pH of 7.4). The obtained filter was dried, and then onto the dried filter, a solid scintillator, MeltiLex A (manufactured by PerkinElmer, Inc.) was fused, and the measurement and quantification were performed by using a β-counter (MicroBeta microplate scintillation counter (Trilux)).
The Ki value was calculated by the following equation. ([L]:[3H]NMS concentration, Kd: dissociation constant of [3H]NMS)

(1) Under an Ar atmosphere, 14.49 g of trimethylsulfonium iodide and 60 mL of dry dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were charged, and then 2.63 g of NaH (60%) was dividedly added to the mixture at 20° C. to 30° C. The resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1.5 hours.
Next, to the mixture, 10.0 g of benzophenone was dividedly added, and the resultant mixture was stirred at 45° C. to 52° C. for 1 hour.
After confirming the disappearance of the starting materials by TLC, the reaction mixture was poured into 200 mL of ice water and 200 mL of EtOAc, and the resultant mixture was stirred for a while.
After the standing and the liquid separation, the obtained organic layer was washed successively with 200 mL of a saturated NaHCO3 aqueous solution and 200 mL of saline solution, and then the organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure, to give concentrated residues (11.7 g).
The obtained concentrated residues were purified by silica gel column chromatography (120 g of silica gel, Heptane/EtOAc=60/1 to 40/1 to 20/1), and then the column fractions containing the target object was concentrated under reduced pressure, to give 1,1-diphenylethylene oxide (3.94 g, yield 36.6%) as colorless oil.

(2) Under an Ar atmosphere, 3.29 g of 3-quinuclidinol and 27 mL of dry DMF were charged, and then 1.03 g of NaOH (60%) was dividedly added to the mixture at 20° C. to 30° C. The resultant mixture was stirred at 45° C. to 50° C. for 1 hour.
Next, to the mixture, 12 mL of dry DMF solution of 3.90 g of 1,1-diphenylethylene oxide was added dropwise, and the resultant mixture was stirred at an internal temperature of 40° C. to 45° C. overnight.
After confirming the disappearance of the starting materials by TLC, the reaction mixture was ice-cooled, and into the cooled mixture, 160 mL of H2O was slowly added dropwise (white crystals precipitated). The mixture was aged and stirred at an internal temperature of 5° C. to 10° C. for around 2 hours, and then the precipitated crystals were collected by filtration, washed with 20 mL×3 of H2O, dried at 50° C. to 55° C. for 4 hours under reduced pressure, to give a treated crude product of the target object (c) (4.22 g) as a pale brownish white solid.
The obtained treated crude product in an amount of 4.22 g was recrystallized by THF-IPE to give the target object (a) (2.21 g) as white crystals.

(3) Under an Ar atmosphere, 2.18 g of phenylpropyl bromide and 44 mL of dry acetone were charged, and then 2.05 mL of 3-phenylpropyl bromide was added to the mixture at 20° C. to 30° C. The resultant mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 3 days (65 h) (white suspension→white suspension).
The reaction mixture was ice-cold stirred for 2 hours, and then the precipitated crystals were collected by filtration, washed with 40 mL×2 of IPE, and dried at 50° C. to 55° C. for 3 hours under reduced pressure, to give a compound (1-44) (3.38 g) as white crystals.
1H NMR (DMSO-d6): δ=7.17-7.44 (m, 15H), 5.70 (s, 1H), 3.94-4.05 (m, 3H), 3.51-3.62 (m, 1H), 3.27-3.31 (m, 5H), 2.95-3.30 (m, 4H), 2.49-2.56 (m, 2H), 1.49-2.42 (m, 7H).
Test Example 2 (Effect on Methacholine-Induced Airway Constriction)
<Method>
The increase of airway resistance by methacholine induction was measured. To 4 to 6-week old ICR mice, methacholine at 1 mg/mL was administered 5 times by spraying the methacholine for 20 seconds. After completion of the methacholine administration, the airway resistance was measured by a snap shot technique. All of the data were analyzed by using FlexiVent software.
The test compound at 47.9 μg/kg was administered to the mice through the transairway. The mice were exposed 5 times to nebulized methacholine 1 hour, 96 hours, and 120 hours after the administration, and the airway resistance at each time was measured.
The results are shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.
<Results>
As can be seen from the results shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, the compound (1-18) and the compound (1-20) reduced the airway resistance at 47.9 μg/kg even 120 hours after the administration. In contrast, as shown in FIG. 2, aclidinium did not reduce the airway resistance when exceeding 96 hours after the administration.
Test Example 3 (Effect on Porcine Pancreatic Elastase-Induced Inflammation)
<Method>
To 4 to 6-week old ICR mice, a test compound was administered once through the transairway. Porcine pancreatic elastase at 100 μg/mouse was administered 1 hour after the administration of the test compound. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected from the lungs 24 hours after the administration of porcine pancreatic elastase, and the total number of cells was measured. The results are shown in FIG. 4.
<Results>
As can be seen from the results shown in FIG. 4, the total number of cells in BALF was reduced in a dose-dependent manner of the compound (1-18), the compound (1-19), and the compound (1-20). In contrast, aclidinium did not show any beneficial anti-inflammatory effects.
From the results described above, it was found that the compounds of the present invention are effective against the inflammatory symptoms caused by porcine pancreatic elastase.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
The compounds of the present invention have a long-term bronchodilation effect, and further show the efficacy against the inflammatory symptoms caused by pancreatic elastase of a porcine animal that is a COPD model, therefore, are extremely useful as a therapeutic agent for COPD having a bronchodilation effect and an anti-inflammatory effect at the same time.
