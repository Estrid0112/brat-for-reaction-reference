BACKGROUND
Field of the Present Disclosure
The present disclosure relates to a delayed fluorescence material emitting over a long period of time, and an organic electroluminescent device comprising the same.
Discussion of Related Art
In order to commercialize an organic light emitting device, it is necessary to improve the efficiency of a light emitting material. For this purpose, studies on phosphorescent and delayed fluorescent materials have been actively carried out. However, although the phosphorescent material achieves the high luminous efficiency, a cost of a metal complex required to realize phosphorescence is high and the lifetime thereof is short.
In connection with the delayed fluorescent material, a recent publication in Nature (2012, 492, 234) and JACS (2012, 134, 14706) introduces the concept of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) by which a high efficiency green fluorescent material with high external quantum efficiency is achieved. The TADF concept represents the phenomenon that reverse transfer of energy from an excited triplet state to an excited singlet state is caused by thermal activation, leading to fluorescence emission. Since the light emission is generated via the triplet state in the TADF and, thus, the light emission has a long lifetime, this is generally referred to as delayed fluorescence. The combination of electron donor units and electron acceptor units to reduce the energy gap between the singlet and the triplet excited states may lead to the delayed fluorescence material with high efficiency. The delayed fluorescent material may use both fluorescence and phosphorescence. Therefore, the delayed fluorescent material may remove the problem in terms of the external quantum efficiency as the conventional fluorescent material has. The delayed fluorescent material may not contain the metal complex, thereby remove the problem of the expensive cost of phosphorescence materials.
However, in developing the delayed fluorescent material, it is difficult to design delayed fluorescent materials having various molecular structures due to limitation of the kinds of electron acceptor units. Therefore, the development of a new electron acceptor unit is required.
