BACKGROUND ART
Traditional Chinese medicines have been used and studied for a long time. Monascus-fermented rice refers to a purple rice-koji prepared by fermentation of rice as raw material with Monascus. Monascus-fermented rice has been used in China since Han dynasty. In 1970s, Professor Endo from Japan separated the physiologically active substance monacolin K from Monascus ruber. Since then, many researchers both at home and abroad have discovered physiologically active substances from the metabolites of Monascus constantly, including monacolin compounds, Monascus pigments, a hypotensive ingredient GABA, an antioxidant ingredient dimerumic acid, and so on. There is still much potential in research and development of Monascus-fermented rice.
Xuezhikang (capsule or tablet), a Monascus-fermented rice preparation, is a lipid-regulatory Chinese drug developed by the applicant and commercially available in China, is rich in multiple active ingredients such as statins, and has less adverse reactions compared to the existing lipid-regulatory chemical drugs. Its indications refer to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases caused by hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Xuezhikang is effective in eliminating dampness and dispelling phlegm, activating blood and removing blood stasis, fortifying the spleen and promoting digestion. Xuezhikang is applied to short breath, acratia, dizziness, headache, oppression in chest, abdominal distension, and anorexia of spleen deficiency and phlegm blockade syndrome; hyperlipidemia; or adjunctive treatment of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases caused by hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis.

The compound according to the invention can be used to prepare a pharmaceutical composition, which is administered to a patient by various routes suitable for the selected administration mode, for example, oral, or parenteral route (intravenous, intramuscular, topical, or subcutaneous route).
Therefore, the compound of the invention in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier) can be administered systemically, e.g., orally. They can be encapsulated into a hard or soft shell gelatin capsule, and pressed into a table. For the treatment by oral administration, an active compound may be combined with one or more excipients, and be used in a form of a deglutible tablet, a buccal tablet, a troche, a capsule, an elixir, a suspension, a syrup, a wafer, etc. The composition and preparation shall comprise at least 0.1% of an active compound. The ratio of the composition to the preparation can be varied certainly, and the active compound may account for about 1 wt % to about 99 wt % of a given unit dosage form. In such a therapeutically active composition, the active compound is in an amount sufficient to obtain an effective dosage level.
A tablet, a troche, a pill, a capsule, and the like may include: a binder, such as tragacanth gum, arabic gum, maize starch or gelatin; an excipient, such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrant, such as maize starch, potato starch, and alginic acid etc; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate; and a sweeting agent, such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame; or a flavoring agent, such as peppermint, winter green oil or cherry flavor. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, in addition to the above types of materials, it may comprise a liquid carrier, such as vegetable oil or polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as a coating or change the physical form of a solid unit dosage form in other manners. For example, a tablet, a pill or a capsule may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar etc. A syrup or elixir may comprise an active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweeting agent, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate or propyl p-hydroxybenzoate as preservative, a dye and a flavoring agent (such as a cherry flavor or an orange flavor). Certainly, any material for preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and be substantively not toxic in its applied amount. In addition, an active compound may be incorporated into a sustained release preparation and a sustained release device.
An active compound may also be administered intravenously or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. An aqueous solution of an active compound or a salt thereof may be prepared, optionally, by mixing it with a non-toxic surfactant. A dispersing agent in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycol, glycerin triacetate and a mixture thereof and in oil may also be prepared. Under the common conditions of storage and use, the preparations may comprise a preservative in order to suppress the growth of microbes.
A pharmaceutical dosage form suitable for injection or infusion may include a sterile aqueous solvent or a dispersing agent or a sterile powder comprising an active ingredient (optionally encapsulated into a liposome) of an immediate preparation such as a solution or a dispersing agent suitable for sterile injection or infusion. Under all the conditions, the final dosage form shall be sterile, liquid or stable under the production and storage conditions. A liquid carrier may be a solution or a liquid disperse medium, including, for example, water, ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid macrogol, etc), vegetable oil, a non-toxic glyceride and a suitable mixture thereof. A suitable fluidity may be retained, for example, by the formation of liposome, by retaining the desired particle size in the presence of a dispersing agent, or by using a surfactant. The effect of suppressing microbes can be obtained by various antibacterial agents and antifungal agents (such as paraben, chlorbutol, phenol, sorbic acid, and thiomersal, etc). In many conditions, an isotonizing agent, such as sugar, buffer or NaCl, is preferably comprised. By the use of a composition of delayed absorbents (e.g., aluminium monostearate and gelatin), an extended absorption of an injectable composition can be obtained.
A sterile injectable solution can be prepared by mixing a desired amount of an active compound in a suitable solvent with the desired various other ingredients as listed above, and then performing filtration and sterilization. In the case of a sterile powder for the preparation of a sterile injectable solution, the preferred preparation method is vacuum drying and freeze drying techniques, which will result in the production of the active ingredient and the powder of any other desired ingredient present in the previous sterile filtration solution.
A useful solid carrier includes crushed solid (such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide etc). A useful liquid carrier includes water, ethanol or ethylene glycol or water-ethanol/ethylene glycol mixture, in which the compound of the invention may be dissolved or dispersed in an effective amount, optionally, with the aid of a non-toxic surfactant. An adjuvant (such as a flavor) and an additional antimicrobial agent may be added to optimize the property for a given use.
A thickener (such as synthetic polymer, fatty acid, fatty acid salt and ester, fatty alcohol, modified cellulose or modified inorganic material) may also be used with a liquid carrier to form a coatable paste, gel, ointment, soap and the like, and be directly applied to the skin of a user.
A therapeutically effective amount of a compound or an active salt or derivative thereof not only depends on the specific salt selected, but also depends on the administration mode, the nature of the disease to be treated and the age and state of a patient, and finally depends on the decision made by an attending physician or a clinical physician.
Above preparation may be present in a unit dosage form, which is a physical dispersion unit comprising a unit dose, suitable for administration to a human body and other mammalian body. A unit dosage form may be capsule(s) or tablet(s). Depending on the particular treatment involved, the amount of an active ingredient in a unit dose may be varied or adjusted between about 0.1 and about 1000 mg or more.
The invention further provides use of the compound according to the invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound in the manufacture of a medicament, in particular a medicament for inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. Correspondingly, the invention provides a method for preventing and/or treating dyslipidemia, hyperlipemia, or atherosclerosis in a patient, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the invention to the patient in need of treatment. Dyslipidemia refers to a condition in which one or more blood lipid-associated indexes of human body do not fall into the corresponding normal ranges, including elevated total cholesterol, elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated apolipoprotein B, elevated triglyceride, and the like. The invention provides a method for preventing and/or treating hypercholesterolemia, combined hyperlipidemia in a patient, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound of the invention to the patient in need of treatment.
The invention provides a method for treating an increase in total cholesterol, an increase in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, an increase in apolipoprotein B, an increase in triglyceride and the like when the effect of a lifestyle intervention therapy (such as diet adjustment, body weight control, more exercise, and quitting smoking) is not satisfactory.
In above uses, the compound of the invention can be used alone, or in combination with an effective amount of additional lipid-regulatory drug(s). The additional lipid-regulatory drug includes cholesterol synthesis inhibitors (statins or salts thereof, such as lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, and pitavastatin, etc), cholesterol absorption inhibitors (Ezetimibe and the like), fibrates (Lopid, lipanthyl ciprofibrate, bezafibrate, fenofibrate and gemfibrozil), nicotinic acids (nicotinic acid, inositol nicotinate, Dongzhiping, and niceritrol, etc), bile acid sequestrants, and phenoxy aromatic acids.
