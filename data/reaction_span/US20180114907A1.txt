Referring to the results of Table 1, emission efficiency was improved for Examples 1 to 3 when compared to that of Comparative Examples 1 to 6. From the results in Table 1, it may be found that organic electroluminescence devices including the compounds according to example embodiments may attain high emission efficiency.
In Examples 1 to 3, a monoamine compound including a phenyl group as an adjacent group to a position where a phenanthryl group and an arylene linker are connected is included. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a volume near a phenanthryl group in which a LUMO orbital which is related to electron transportation is distributed, is increased, while maintaining amine properties, and the transportation of electrons from an emission layer to a hole transport layer becomes difficult, and thus, the concentration of excitons in the emission layer is increased to increase the emission efficiency.
In Comparative Example 3, a compound in which a phenanthryl group and an amine group are connected via an arylene linker is included, but the phenanthryl group in the compound included in Comparative Example 3 is not substituted with a phenyl group. Accordingly, without being bound by theory, it is believed that blocking effect of electrons transported from an emission layer to a hole transport layer is not attained, and emission efficiency is lower than that of the examples.
In Comparative Example 4, a compound in which a phenyl group is substituted at a phenanthryl group is included, but the phenyl group is not substituted at a position adjacent to a position where the phenanthryl group and an arylene linker are connected, that is, not at the carbon of position 10 of the phenanthryl group, but at the carbon of position 3. Accordingly, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the volume increase at an active position, where a LUMO orbital which is related to electron transportation is distributed, is not attained, and emission efficiency is reduced when compared to that of the examples.
In Comparative Examples 5 and 6, the devices included a diamine compound having a low HOMO energy level, such that hole injection from a hole injection layer to a hole transport layer may be deteriorated. Accordingly, emission efficiency was lower when compared to that of the examples.

Referring to the results of Table 2, it may be found that emission efficiency was improved for Examples 4 to 12 when compared to that of Comparative Examples 7 to 15. From the results in Table 2, it may be found that organic electroluminescence devices including the compounds according to example embodiments may attain high emission efficiency.
In Examples 4 to 12, a monoamine compound including a phenyl group as an adjacent group to a position where a phenanthryl group and an arylene linker are connected is included. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a volume near a phenanthryl group in which a LUMO orbital which is related to electron transportation is distributed, is increased, while maintaining amine properties, and the transportation of electrons from an emission layer to a hole transport layer becomes difficult, and thus, the concentration of excitons in the emission layer is increased to increase the emission efficiency.
In Comparative Examples 9, 13, and 14, a compound in which a phenanthryl group and an amine group are connected via an arylene linker is included, but the phenanthryl group in the compounds included in Comparative Examples 9, 13, and 14 is not substituted with a phenyl group. Accordingly, without being bound by theory, it is believed that blocking effect of electrons transported from an emission layer to a hole transport layer is not attained, and emission efficiency is lower than that of the examples.
In Comparative Examples 10 and 15, a compound in which a phenyl group is substituted at a phenanthryl group is included, but the phenyl group is not substituted at an adjacent position to a position where the phenanthryl group and an arylene linker are connected, that is, not at the carbon of position 10 of the phenanthryl group, but at the carbon of position 3. Accordingly, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the volume increase at an active position, where a LUMO orbital which is related to electron transportation is distributed, is not attained, and emission efficiency is reduced when compared to that of the examples.
In Comparative Examples 11 and 12, the devices included a diamine compound having a low HOMO energy level, such that hole injection from a hole injection layer to a hole transport layer may be deteriorated. Accordingly, emission efficiency was lower when compared to that of the examples.
By way of summation and review, an organic electroluminescence device may be, for example, an organic device having a first electrode, a hole transport layer disposed on the first electrode, an emission layer disposed on the hole transport layer, an electron transport layer disposed on the emission layer, and a second electrode disposed on the electron transport layer. Holes are injected from the first electrode, and the injected holes move via the hole transport layer and injected into the emission layer. Meanwhile, electrons are injected from the second electrode, and the injected electrons move via the electron transport layer and injected into the emission layer. By recombining the injected holes and electrons into the emission layer, excitons are generated in the emission layer. An organic electroluminescence device emits light using light emitted during the transition of the excitons back to a ground state. The configuration of an organic electroluminescence device is not limited thereto, and various modifications may be possible.
As described above, a monoamine compound according to an example embodiment may be used as a material for an organic electroluminescence device. The organic electroluminescence device including the monoamine compound according to an example embodiment may attain high emission efficiency.
