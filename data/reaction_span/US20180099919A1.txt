TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
This application relates to a process for the preparation of (1R,3R)- and (1S,3S)-2,2-dihalo-3-(substituted phenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acids.

In Scheme 1, the (±)-trans-racemate of Formula 1-1 (i.e., the mixture of (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a trans-2,2-dichloro-3-(substituted phenyl)cyclopropane-carboxylic acid) is combined with a resolving agent that is either the enantiomeric amine of Formula 2-1 or Formula 2-2, in a suitable solvent, to provide the diastereomeric amine salts of Formula 3-1A or Formula 3-1B,
