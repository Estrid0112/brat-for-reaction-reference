TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical synthesis. Specifically, the present invention relates to a method of preparation for Ledipasvir and derivatives thereof and intermediate compounds for preparation of Ledipasvir; and more specifically, relates to a method for preparing the compounds of formula 1.
BACKGROUND
Ledipasvir (LDV, the structure is as shown in formula 1-LDV) is a therapeutic drug for hepatitis C developed by Gilead. FDA has approved the breakthrough therapy LDV/SCF (Sofosbuvir) fixed-dose combination drug, and the combination therapy is expected to cure genotype 1 HCV patients in a period of short to 8 weeks without injection of interferon or combination with ribavirin

US20100310512 has reported a synthetic route of Ledipasvir as follows:
<img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00003.TIF </img><img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00004.TIF </img>
The two side chains of compound 1-LDV are both Moc-Val, but in compound 21 Cbz- is first introduced, then in compound 13-Br Moc-Val on the left is introduced by hydrolysis and condensation, and as for the right side chain, Boc- is first introduced in 17-Br and then Moc-Val on the right is introduced by hydrolysis and condensation, which means the target product was obtained by introduction of protecting group firstly and then by two times of hydrolysis as well as condensation. The reaction process is tedious and the raw materials are expensive. The tedious synthesis method makes the raw material cost more expensive, so it is needed to use more efficient way to reduce the cost of raw materials.
US2013324740 has reported a preparation method for Ledipasvir as follows:
<img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00005.TIF </img><img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00006.TIF </img>
This method is more efficient than that of US20100310512, but it still requires the preparation of Boc-protected compounds 24 and 27, which need to be deprotected by hydrolysis, and the yield is still not high, and the emission of three wastes will be also increased.
Therefore, it is still needed to find a more convenient and efficient preparation method for Ledipasvir.

To a three-necked flask compound 1'-LDV-Boc-Boc (5.45 g, 5 mmol) and DCM (40 mL) were added, to which a solution of HCl in dioxane (4 M/L, 40 mL) was added dropwise with stirring at 10° C. After the addition the mixture was stirred for 5 hours. Then the solvent was distilled off to give the product (4.44 g, yield 100%).

In a three-necked flask, compound 13-Br (3.4 g, 5.675 mmol), DMAP (0.139 g, 1.135 mmol), triethylamine (1.148 g, 11.35 mmol) and DCM (50 mL) were added, to which o-chlorobenzoyl chloride (1.99 g, 11.35 mmol) was added with stirring. After the addition, the mixture was stirred for 16 hours. Then DCM (100 mL) was added and the mixture was washed with brine (200 mL) twice. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off to obtain the product (4.1 g, yield 98%).

In a three-necked flask, compound 14-B (2.726 g, 5.675 mmol), DMAP (0.139 g, 1.135 mmol), triethylamine (1.148 g, 11.35 mmol) and DCM (50 mL) were added, to which o-chlorobenzoyl chloride (1.99 g, 11.35 mmol) was added with stirring. After the addition, the mixture was stirred for 16 hours. Then DCM (100 mL) was added and the mixture was washed with brine (200 mL) twice. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off to obtain the product (3.34 g, yield 95%).
Example 31: Synthesis of Compound 1'-LDV-Bz-Bz
<img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00078.TIF </img>
Compound 15-Br-Bz (3.69 g, 5 mmol), compound 16-B-Bz (3.4 g, 5.5 mmol), PdCl2(dppf) (0.037 g, 0.05 mmol), potassium carbonate (2.073 g, 15 mmol), water (10 mL) and tert-amyl alcohol (50 mL) were added into a three-necked bottle. Under nitrogen the mixture was heated to 90° C. and stirred for 16 hours. After that the mixture was cooled to room temperature and ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added. The mixture was washed with brine (200 mL) twice. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was distilled off to give the product (5.25 g, yield 90%).
Example 32: Synthesis of Compound 1-LDV
<img> id-US20180079744A1-20180322-C00079.TIF </img>
Compound 1'-LDV-Bz-Bz (5.25 g, 4.5 mmol), potassium phosphate aqueous solution (1M/L, 50 mL) and tert-amyl alcohol (50 mL) were added to a three-necked flask, and the temperature was raised to 90° C. The mixture was stirred for 5 hours, then cooled to room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated to give the product (4 g, yield 100%).
