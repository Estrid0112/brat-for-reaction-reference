FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceutical synthesis, and specifically relates to a cholic acid derivative, and the preparation method and use thereof.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The farnesyl derivative X receptor (FXR) is a member of the hormone nuclear receptor superfamily, which is mainly expressed in liver, small intestine, kidney and adrenal gland, and is less expressed in adipose tissue and heart. It is named as FXR because farnesol is thought as its ligand initially. When the FXR ligand directly binds to the ligand-binding region(LBD) of carboxy terminal of FXR, the conformation of the nuclear receptor changes and forms a heterodimer with the retinal derivative receptor (RXR), which is ultimately integrated with the specific FXR DNA response element of target gene to regulate the transcription of the target gene, involved in the regulation of sugar and lipid metabolism. FXR thus is an important energy regulator. Primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid is the most effective ligand for FXR, and secondary bile acid lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid can also activate FXR. There are also synthetic FXR ligands (such as 6-ECDCA, GW4064, etc.), which is several times stronger than natural ligands in binding FXR. The main target genes of FXR include bile salt export pump (BSEP), bile acid binding protein (IBABP) and small heterodimeric partner receptor (SHP), etc. FXR regulates the expression of these genes by reacting with FXR reaction elements (FXRE) on these gene promoters. However, there is no typical FXR binding response sequences in the promoter sequence of certain major FXR regulatory genes, such as cholesterol 7α hydroxylase (CYP7α1), so FXR blocks the transcription of CYP7α1 and other LRH-1 target genes by indirectly inducing the expression of transcriptional repressor SHP, which then forms inhibition complexes with the liver receptor homologue (LRH-1) of CYP7α1 promoter. FXR plays an important role in bile acid and cholesterol metabolism, which will make its relationship between liver-related diseases attracted more and more attention. Finding a new FXR agonist has become a hot research topic in the treatment of liver diseases including cholestasis syndrome. As a treatment for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), 6-ethyl chenodeoxycholic acid (obeticholic acid) has been completed in Phase III Clinical trials, and will be list in the market as early as 2015. This compound also shows satisfactory treatment effect in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. FXR agonists either can increase bile acid-dependent bile flow by stimulating bile salt export pump (BSEP), or can reduce cholestasis by stimulating MRP2 to increase non-bile acid-dependent bile flow. FXR is expected to be a target for screening new drug which can treat other metabolic diseases, including cholestatic diseases and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and the like. Furthermore, the current studies have shown that FXR agonists may be valuable in the treatment and research of diseases including atherosclerosis, cholestatic diseases caused by bile acid disorder, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, cancer and the like (please refer to table 1).

<img> id-imgb0046.tif </img>
Step 1:
6α-Ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid (OCA, 6.0 g, 14.2 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of 4N HCl in methanol and stirred at reflux for 2 hours. After TLC (PE: EA=1: 2) showed completion of the reaction, methanol was removed by evaporation. The reaction solution was adjusted to basicity by adding saturated sodium bicarbonate, and extracted with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain compound 1-ii (6.0 g, 98%).
Step 2:
Compound 1-ii (4.0 g, 9.2 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL of toluene, and then added with silver carbonate (5.0 g, 18.4 mmol) and celatom (10 g). The reaction solution was stirred at reflux for 24 hours. After TLC(PE: EA=1: 2) showed completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was filtered to remove celatom, and then washed with ethyl acetate several times. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residues were purified by column chromatography to obtain compound 1-iii (1.0 g, 25%).
Step 3:
Compound 1-iii (100 mg, 0.21 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and then added with TMSCl (200 µL, 1.05 mmol) and LDA (90 µL, 0.42 mmol) at -78 °C. The mixture was stirred for 3 hours, quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain an intermediate. The resulting product was dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour after selectflour (105 mg, 0.29 mmol) was added. After TLC (PE: EA = 5: 1) showed completion of the reaction, 10 mL of water was added, and the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was concentrated under reduced pressure to obtain 100 mg of compound 1-iv, and the crude product was used directly in the next step.
Step 4:
Compound 1-iv (300 mg, 0.6 mmol) was dissolved in dioxane / H2O (10 mL / 0.5 mL), and sodium borohydride (49 mg, 1.3 mmol) was added in portions. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. One equivalent of sodium borohydride was added in the reaction mixture, and the stirring was continued for 4 hours. After TLC (PE: EA = 5: 1) showed the disappearance of the starting material, the reaction was quenched with 10 mL of water, extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and purified by column chromatography to obtain compound 1-v (40 mg, 15%).
Step 5:
Compound 1-v (40 mg, 0.088 mmol) was dissolved in 1 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and added with 1 mL of 1 N NaOH . The reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. After TLC (PE: EA = 1: 1) showed completion of the reaction, the reaction solution was adjusted to acidity by adding 1N HCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate.
