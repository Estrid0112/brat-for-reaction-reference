[Background Art]
Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease which is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. It is estimated that there are about 6.3 million Parkinson's disease patients globally, with about 1 out of 1,000 people. Although Parkinson's disease occurs common in the elderly, it occurs in young people too. Parkinson's disease is not easily distinguished from other diseases because the symptoms develop slowly. It is not easily detected in early stages and is accompanied by abnormal clinical symptoms such as tremor, stiffness, slowing of movement, postural instability, stooped posture, freezing of gait, depression, sleep disorder, dysuria, dementia, etc.
Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is not clear, it is known to be caused by deficiency in dopamine resulting from the loss of neurons that secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. At present, the levodopa therapy of administering levodopa which is converted into dopamine in the body is commonly used. Although levodopa is the most effective therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease, decreased drug efficacy or various motor disorders can occur during treatment. As alternative medications, COMT inhibitors, MAO-B inhibitors, etc., which maintain the concentration of dopamine in the brain by inhibiting the metabolism of dopamine, are used.
It is known that MAO-B not only plays an important role in dopamine metabolism in the brain but also inhibits damage to cranial nerve cells. Although there is no clear evidence that the MAO-B inhibitor actually delays the progress of Parkinson's disease, it is known that inhibition of MAO-B leads to inhibition of denaturation or destruction of dopaminergic neurons because it plays an important role in the onset of Parkinson's disease by MPTP or similar environmental toxicants. Also, there are evidences from animal and clinical tests that the MAO-B inhibitor has an effect of protecting the brain unlike other drugs.
Selegiline, which is approved as the most representative MAO-B inhibitor, is prescribed as a therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease. However, it causes hepatotoxicity because it is metabolized to amphetamine and the irreversible inhibitor is accompanied by various side effects. Since rasagiline (Azilect) was first marketed in 2005 in Israel, it was marketed in about 50 countries including Europe, USA, etc. Azilect is free from amphetamine side effects and exhibits better efficacy than other dopaminergic drugs. However, although rasagiline also exhibits superior effect of inhibiting MAO-B like selegiline as an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor, it has a safety problem. Therefore, drugs that can effectively and reversibly inhibit the activity of MAO-B while solving the above-described disadvantages are being developed. However, no noticeable reversible inhibitor is available yet.
Obesity refers to a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. It is a condition in which excess energy has accumulated due to the difference in energy intake and energy expenditure. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases.
Because the previous studies on the hypothalamus regarding the regulation of food intake have been conducted centered on neurons as part of the brain, the understanding of the diet/obesity regulation by the brain has been limited. Therefore, study on glial cells (glia) which account for a greater part is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the brain function. Recently, astrocytes which are the most abundant of the glial cells are spotlighted as cells that can activate or suppress nearby neurons by secreting various signaling molecules such as GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), glutamate, D-serine, ATP, etc. Astrocytes of the hypothalamus, which closely interact with POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons and express leptin receptors, can also contribute to leptin signaling.
In the hypothalamus, there exist two groups of POMC neurons, one that stimulates appetite and the other that stimulates energy consumption. Under normal situations, the astrocytes help the activation of nearby POMC neurons which stimulate energy consumption. However, in obesity, they turn to reactive astrocytes due to excessive leptin signals and putrescine is turned to GABA and secreted by MAO-B (monoamine oxidase B). In addition, the POMC neurons that stimulate energy consumption express GABAa receptors outside synapses including the a4, a5 and a6 subunits due to excessive leptin signals and are affected by the GABA secreted by the reactive astrocytes. As a result, the POMC neurons are inhibited and energy consumption is decreased, leading to accumulation of fats.
If MAO-B, which is the enzyme responsible for production of GABA, is inhibited, the production and secretion of GABA are inhibited and energy consumption is promoted as the POMC neurons are activated again. However, the POMC neurons that suppress appetite are not affected by GABA because they do not express GABAa receptors outside synapses. Therefore, the MAO-B inhibitors act on the POMC neurons which selectively excite energy consumption, thereby exhibiting an effect of treating obesity. However, most of the existing MAO-B inhibitors exhibit various side effects as irreversible inhibitors. Although drugs that can reversibly inhibit MAO-B are studied and developed for this reason, no noticeable reversible MAO-B inhibitor that can effectively act on obesity is available yet.

Specifically, 4-bromobenzaldehyde (3 g, 16.21 mmol), boronic acid (1.28 equivalents), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (4-8 mol%) and sodium carbonate (4.86 equivalents) were refluxed in degassed toluene/distilled water (150 mL/21.6 mL) for 18 hours while heating. The reaction mixture was filtered through celite and the filtrate was washed twice with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and water (200 mL). The organic layer was combined and dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo and then separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography.
(2) Steps (B) and (C)
An imine compound was obtained by subjecting the compound of the step (A) to reductive amination using L-alaninamide hydrochloride or D-alaninamide hydrochloride (step (B), Scheme 1b). Then, an amine compound was obtained by reducing the imine compound with sodium cyanoborohydride (step (C), Scheme 1c).
After adding 1.2 equivalents of glycinamide hydrochloride or L-alaninamide hydrochloride or D-alaninamide hydrochloride or L-valinamide hydrochloride or L-leucinamide hydrochloride to anhydrous methanol to a concentration of 0.92 M, 1.5 equivalents of triethylamine was added. When the solution became transparent, 1.0 equivalent of the aldehyde synthesized in the step (A) was added. Two hours later, the solution was washed with ethyl acetate and distilled water. After drying the organic layer with sodium sulfate and drying in vacuo, the concentrated reaction solution was dissolved in anhydrous methanol to a concentration of 1.0 M and then 4.0 equivalents of sodium cyanoborohydride was added at 0 °C. After performing reaction at room temperature for 18 hours, the reaction solution was washed with ethyl acetate and distilled water. The organic layer was dried with sodium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo and then separated and purified by silica gel column chromatography.
(3) Preparation of salt
The salt preparation step is an optional step that can be either performed, if necessary, or omitted. A compound in salt form is synthesized to improve the solubility of the amine compound synthesized in the preceding step. The compound in salt form may be synthesized using an acid. The acid that can be used is described above but is not limited thereto.
Specifically, a compound in salt form was synthesized using methanesulfonic acid. After heating ethyl acetate to 50-55 °C and completely dissolving 1.0 equivalent of the compound of the step (C), 1.25 equivalents of methanesulfonic acid was added. 1 hour later, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and filtered using a vacuum filtration device. The filtrate was washed with ethyl acetate and dried without a purification process.

(S)-safnamide
Safinamide is well known as a substance that exhibits superior MAO-B inhibiting effect and efficacy in animals. However, it is limited to be used as a selective MAO-B inhibitor because it also acts as a calcium channel and sodium channel inhibitor.

As can be seen from Table 1, when various functional groups were introduced to the position X of the biphenyl group, better activity was achieved when the functional group was introduced to the para position as compared to the ortho or meta position and excellent inhibitory effect was achieved when -CF3 or -OCF3 was introduced as compared to when F or Cl was introduced. In particular, the compound of Example 9 showed the best activity which is 2 times or higher than that of safinamide. Although the compound of Example 15, which is a stereoisomer of the compound of Example 9, also showed superior activity, its activity was slightly lower than that of the compound of Example 9. In addition, alkyl groups such as hydrogen, isopropyl and isobutyl were introduced instead of the methyl group at the position R. Whereas the compound of Example 16 wherein hydrogen was introduced showed slightly decreased activity, significantly decreased activity was observed when isopropyl and isobutyl groups which are larger than the methyl group were introduced.
Also, the cytotoxicity and passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) of the compounds of the examples according to the present disclosure were investigated. The followings were confirmed.(1) The position of the substituent X is preferable in the order of para, meta and ortho. In particular, the para position is the most preferable in terms of MAO-B inhibition activity and the effect of remarkably reducing antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity can be achieved additionally as compared to the ortho and meta positions.(2) As the substituent X, -OCF3, -CF3 and -Cl showed superior MAO-B inhibition activity. In particular, -OCF3 or -CF3 showed better MAO-B inhibition activity than -Cl, -OCH3 or -F and the effect of allowing easy passage through the blood-brain barrier can be achieved additionally.(3) The S-isomer showed better MAO-B inhibition activity and remarkably superior recovery of MAO-B activity as compared to the R-isomer. In addition, good metabolic stability and significantly low cytotoxicity can be achieved additionally.(4) As the substituent R, -CH3 and -H showed superior MAO-B activity. In particular, -CH3 exhibits better MAO-B activity than -H, -CH(CH3)2 or -CH2CH(CH3)2 and the effect of allowing easy passage through the blood-brain barrier can be achieved additionally.
Hereinafter, test examples were performed on the compound of Example 9 as a representative example of the compounds to confirm efficacy. It is obveious that the same tests can be conducted on other compounds based on the description of the present disclosure.
Test Example 2: Confirmation of reversible inhibitory effect
Reversible inhibitory effect was investigated according to the method described in Fig. 1.
An enzyme buffer was prepared by diluting 5 mg/mL of human-derived monoamine oxidase B with a 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer to 1/40. After mixing 441 µL of the enzyme buffer with 9 µL of the compound of Example 9 (0.1 mM), reaction was performed for 2 hours.
The reaction solution was divided into two, with 200 µL each. One was transferred to a 96-well plate (A) and the remainder was centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 minutes in a centrifugal filter (Amicon® Ultra-3K) (B). After adding 500 µL of a 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer to the centrifugal filter, centrifugation was performed at 14,000 g for 20 minutes. This procedure was repeated 2 times.
The human-derived monoamine oxidase B remaining in the centrifugal filter was diluted by adding 200 µL of a 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer to the centrifugal filter and then transferred to a 96-well plate. Then, 100 µL of a working buffer prepared by adding 20 mM Amplex Red (200 µL), 100 mM benzylamine substrate (200 µL) and 200 U/mL horseradish peroxidase (100 µL) to a 0.05 M sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer (9.5 mL) was mixed with the enzyme buffer at 1:1 and absorbance was measured (570 nm) after conducting incubation for 2 hours.
Selegiline well known as an irreversible MAO-B inhibitor was used as a control to test the reversibility of the compound of the present disclosure. The result is shown in Table 2.

As seen from Table 2, both compounds showed 80% or higher inhibitory effect at 1 µM. When the activity of MAO-B was measured again after washing 3 times with a buffer, the irreversible inhibitor selegiline maintained its inhibitory effect but the compound of the present disclosure showed no inhibitory effect because it was washed off during the washing procedure. The fact that the activity of MAO-B was recovered as the inhibitory compound was washed off reveals that the compound of the present disclosure is a reversible inhibitor.
Test Example 3: Efficacy of compound 9 in MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease
The efficacy of compound 9 in the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease was compared with that of the existing MAO-B inhibitor safinamide. 20 mg/kg of MPTP was injected intraperitoneally in order to induce Parkinson's disease and 10 mg/kg of MAO-B inhibitors including compound 9 were administered orally. First, the MAO-B inhibitor was administered for 3 days starting from one day before the injection of the MPTP and its effect was analyzed quantitatively by an immunohistochemical method using TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) as a marker for dopaminergic neurons. As the brain parts for analysis, the substantia nigra and the corpus striatum where dopaminergic neurons are present were selected. It is well known that the expression of TH in these regions decreases significantly in Parkinson's disease. In the following experiments, it was investigated whether compound 9 protects dopaminergic neurons from MPTP by inhibiting MAO-B.(1) First, after treating once with compound 9, its efficacy in the MPTP-treated mouse model was tested.As seen from Fig. 2a, the expression of TH was remarkably decreased in the model treated only with MPTP after the tyrosine hydroxylase staining as compared to the control group (saline), which suggests that the number of dopaminergic neurons was decreased remarkably. However, the models treated with the MAO-B inhibitors safinamide and compound 9 showed dopaminergic neuron survivability comparable to that of the control group.(2) Next, after establishing a MPTP mouse model by treating with MPTP, the compound was treated from day 3 and it was observed whether the dopaminergic neurons were recovered in the Parkinson's disease animal model due to inhibition of MAO-B.As seen from Fig. 2b, the neurons were destroyed in the MPTP-treated group as in the pre-treatment experiment. In contrast, the models treated with the MAO-B inhibitors safinamide and compound 9 showed significantly decreased death of the neurons. In particular, compound 9 recovered the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra to a level comparable to that of the control group not treated with MPTP.(3) Next, considering the long-term period of medication, it was investigated whether the administration of the MAO-B inhibitor for 30 days is effective in protecting neurons in the MPTP model of Parkinson's disease. In the corpus striatum, the irreversible inhibitors selegiline and compound 9 protected dopaminergic neurons to a level comparable to that of the control group not treated with MPTP. Safinamide exhibited slightly lower efficacy. On the other hand, in the substantia nigra, the efficacy of the irreversible inhibitor selegiline was decreased and the number of neurons did not recover significantly as compared to the MPTP group. In contrast, the reversible inhibitor compound 9 protected neurons similarly to the control group. This suggests that the MAO-B inhibitory effect of selegiline is offset upon long-term medication due to a compensatory mechanism because it inhibits MAO-B irreversibly. This is the reason why selegiline is not effective in treating Parkinson's disease upon long-term medication. That is to say, as seen from Fig. 2c, compound 9 showed superior efficacy as compared to selegiline and safinamide in the three testes on the MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
Test Example 4: Efficacy of compound 9 in APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease
The inventors of the present disclosure have recently unveiled a new possibility of Alzheimer's disease treatment through inhibition of MAO-B (Jo et al., Nature Medicine 2014). In this research, they have found out that, as shown in Figs. 3a-3b, whereas the irreversible MAO-B inhibitor selegiline shows excellent efficacy initially in the Alzheimer's disease model but the efficacy decreases greatly after 2 weeks and no efficacy is observed after 4 weeks, the reversible MAO-B inhibitor safinamide maintains excellent efficacy even after 2 weeks.
In Test Example 4, the efficacy of the reversible MAO-B inhibitor compound 9 in APP/PS1 mouse was investigated as follows. First, APP/PS1 mouse was allowed to freely take in compound 9 for 2 weeks at a dosage of by mixing in drinking water. After 2 weeks of administration, brain tissue sections were prepared and electrodes were connected to dentate gyrus granule cells using the patch-clamp technique. The change in the membrane potential of the granule cells and spike can be detected using the electrodes. Spike probability was calculated by counting the number of spike responses of the granule cells while applying 10 electric stimulations to the dentate gyrus. When the spike probability was measured while varying the intensity of the electric stimulation after the treatment with compound 9 for 2 weeks, superior efficacy was observed as shown in Fig. 3b. The efficacy of compound 9 was higher than that of safinamide.
Test Example 5: Differentiability and superiority of compound 9 as compared to safinamide
The existing reversible MAO-B inhibitor safinamide is well known not only for its MAO-B inhibitory effect but also as a sodium channel and calcium channel inhibitor. A therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease which selectively inhibits MAO-B with minimized channel inhibition can have good stability as a therapeutic agent for brain disease. In order to investigate the channel inhibitory effect, inhibition of channel excitability was investigated electrophysiologically using DGGCs (dentate gyrus granule cells) of the hippocampus.
As can be seen from Fig. 4, whereas safinamide showed about 40% of excitability inhibitory effect at 10 µM, compound 9 showed almost no inhibitory effect. Compound 9 showed lower inhibitory effect than safinamide at higher concentration of 50 µM, too. This reveals that the excitability inhibitory effect of compound 9 for hippocampal DGGCs is much lower than that of safinamide. This result shows that compound 9 is stable as a selective MAO-B inhibitor due to much lower channel inhibitory effect as compared to safinamide.
Test Example 6: Molecular modeling of compound 9 and safinamide for MAO-B
The binding mode of compound 9 for MAO-B was predicted through docking experiment. First, the binding mode of the reversible inhibitor safinamide was predicted using the MAO-B X-ray crystal structure. As shown in Fig. 5, superior binding affinity was observed at the pocket which is known as the active site of MAO-B (SP score: -10.862 kcal/mol). When calculation was conducted for compound 9, it was predicted to bind at the same active site as safinamide and the binding affinity was estimated to be stronger than safinamide (SP score: -11.795 kcal/mol).
Test Example 7: Obesity inhibition effect
A. Establishment of obesity model mouse using high-fat diet
7-week-old mice were divided into 2 groups and were given a normal diet (white, chow) and a high-fat diet (blue, HFD), respectively, for 8 weeks. The result is shown in Fig. 6.
The total calorie provided to the normal diet mice and the high-fat diet mice was set to be equal. The average body weight of the normal diet group was measured to be 3 g at 8 weeks, with about 20% increase from the initial weight of 2.5 g. In contrast, the average body weight of the high-fat diet almost doubled to about 4.8 g.
B. Emergence of reactive astrocytes in obesity model mouse
The change in reactive astrocytes was observed in the arcuate nucleus of the mice to which the high-fat diet was given for 8 weeks. As shown in Fig. 7, remarkable increase in GFAP, which is a biomarker for reactive astrocytes, was observed in the arcuate nucleus of the high-fat diet mice as compared to the normal diet mice. In addition to the increase in reactive astrocytes, overproduction of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was also detected.
C. Decrease in body weight of obesity model mouse by compound of Example 9
The body weight decreasing effect of the compound of Example 9 in the HFD (high-fat diet) mouse model of obesity was investigated. As shown in Fig. 8, the compound of Example 9 inhibited body weight increase due to the intake of the high-fat diet in a concentration-dependent manner and there was no difference in the amount of food intake. Specifically, the high-fat diet mice showed 20% or more increased body weight as compared to the normal mice (control). The administration of the compound of Example 9 resulted in decrease of the body weight. In particular, the 10 mg/kg/day group and the 100 mg/kg/day group also showed body weight decrease in a concentration-dependent manner.
D. Increase in GABA in reactive astrocytes of arcuate nucleus of obesity model mouse and decrease of GABA by compound of Example 9
A result of administering the compound of Example 9 to the high-fat diet mice is shown in Fig. 9. Remarkable decrease in GFAP, which is a biomarker for reactive astrocytes, was observed in the arcuate nucleus and effective inhibition of the overproduction of GABA was also confirmed.
Through these results, it can be seen that a composition containing the α-aminoamide derivative according to the present disclosure as an active ingredient can be usefully used as a therapeutic agent for obesity because the α-aminoamide derivative can exhibit anti-obesity efficacy by reversibly inhibiting MAO-B.
[Industrial Applicability]
Because the α-aminoamide derivative can prevent overproduction of GABA in reactive astrocytes of the hypothalamus by inhibiting MAO-B, it can exhibit an effect of treating obesity by acting on POMC neurons which selectively induce energy consumption. Accordingly, it can overcome the side effect and efficacy problems of the existing obesity therapeutic agents centered on the central nervous system and regulation of sugar/fat metabolism and can be usefully used as a new obesity therapeutic agent. In addition, it can be usefully used as a therapeutic agent for a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, etc. because it can inhibit the denaturation or destruction of dopaminergic neurons.
