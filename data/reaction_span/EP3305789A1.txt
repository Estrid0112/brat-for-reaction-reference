TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel compound having an antiviral activity, more particularly, an anti-HIV drug.
BACKGROUND ART
Among viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (hereinafter abbreviated as HIV) that is a type of retrovirus is known to be a cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (hereinafter abbreviated as AIDS). As a therapeutic agent of the AIDS, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (AZT, 3TC, etc.), protease inhibitors (indinavir, etc.), and integrase inhibitor (raltegravir, etc.) are mainly used so far, but problems of side effects such as kidney problems and emergence of resistant viruses have been found, and development of anti-HIV drugs having a mechanism of action different from those is expected.
In addition, in the treatment of AIDS, because resistant viruses easily emerge, it is reported that, multiple drug therapy is currently effective. As the anti-HIV drugs, three types of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and integrase inhibitors have been used clinically, but the agents having the same mechanism of action often exhibit cross-resistance, or merely show additive effects, and there is a demand for the development of anti-HIV drugs having a different mechanism of action.
Anti-HIV drugs with a carboxyalkyl type side chain into a six-membered ring nucleus, such as benzene or pyridine, on their condensed ring, is described in Patent Document 1 to 32 and 36. In particular, five-membered heterocycle condensed with a benzene derivative is described in Patent Document 28 (WO2013/159064), Patent Document 29 (WO2012/145728) etc. Also in Patent Document 16 (WO2012/140243) and Patent Document 36 (WO2014/057103), benzene derivatives having various substituents are described. Moreover anti-HIV drugs having a carboxyalkyl type side chains at 5-membered ring nucleus are described in Patent Document 33 to 35. However, in any of the literature, tricyclic compounds of the present invention are not described.
Furthermore, patents relating to anti-HIV drugs, such as recent integrase inhibitors, have been introduced in Non-patent Document 1.

The biology assays of the compound of the present invention are described below.
Test Example 1: HIV Replication Inhibition Assay
HIV (HTLV-IIIB strain) persistent infected human T cell strain Molt-4 clone8 was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the supernatant was filtered, then the virus titer was measured and stored at -80°C. Each anti-human immunodeficiency virus active substance was diluted with the abov e culture medium to the designated concentration, which was dispensed into 96-well microtiter plate by 50µL. Next, 100 µL of MT-4 cell suspension (2.5 × 104 cells) was dispensed into each well, then 50 µl of the above HIV-containing supernatant d iluted with the above culture medium was added thereto (60 pfu (plaque forming uni t)).
Cell mixture was cultured at 37°C in CO2 incubator for four days, then 30 µL of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolyum bromide) reagent (5 mg/m L in PBS) was added to all wells followed by incubation for 1 hour. In this step, MTT was reduced to insoluble formazan in living cells. To elute generated formazan , 150 µL of the culture supernatant was removed from all wells, then 150 µL of cell lysis solution (10% Triton X-100 and 0.4% (v/v)-HCl containing isopropanol) was ad ded thereto, followed by shaking with a plate mixer. The formazan was measured with micro plate reader at OD: 560 nm and 690 nm (reference wavelength) and the result was compared with the reference wells. EC50 and EC90 mean the compound concentration at which cytotoxicity caused by virus infection is inhibited 50% and 9 0%, respectively.
(Result) The EC50 are shown below.

Test Example 2: HIV Replication Inhibition Assay
Persistently HIV (HTLV-IIIB strain) infected human T cell strain Molt-4 clone8 was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and the supernatant was filtered, then the virus titer was measured and stored at -80°C. Polymorphic mutations in HIV-1-infected patients have been observed in amino acids 124 and 125 on the HIV-1 integrase (IN) gene. A point mutation was introduced on the amino acids 124 and/or 125 of IN gene of the HIV-1 NL-432 recombinant molecular clone to generate a mutant virus plasmid construct. These mutant virus plasmids were transfected into 293T cells, and after two days, the supernatant was filtered and then the virus titer was measured and stored at -80°C. Each anti-HIV active substance was diluted with culture medium described above to the designated concentration, which was dispensed into 96-well microtiter plate by 50µL. Next, 100 µL of MT-4 cell suspension (2.5 × 104 cells) was dispensed into each well, then 50 µl of HIV-containing supernatant diluted with culture medium described above was added thereto (60 pfu (plaque forming unit)).Cells were cultured at 37°C in CO2 incubator for four days, then 30 µL of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolyum bromide) reagent (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to all wells followed by incubation for 1 hour. In this step, MTT was reduced to insoluble formazan in living cells. To elute generated formazan, 150 µL of the culture supernatant was removed from all wells, then 150 µL of cell lysis solution (10% Triton X-100 and 0.4% (v/v)-HCl containing isopropanol) was added thereto, followed by shaking with a plate mixer. The formazan was measured with micro plate reader at OD: 560 nm and 690 nm (reference wavelength) and the result was compared with the reference wells. EC50 means the compound concentration at which 50% of cytotoxicity caused by virus infection is inhibited.
(Result) The EC50 against T125A mutant virus about 125 amino acids are shown below.

Test Example 3: Calculation of Potency Shift Value
To confirm the influence of human serum on anti-HIV activity as necessary, human serum was added and determined EC50 in this condition. Human serum (100 µL / well) was dispensed into each anti-HIV active substance at a designated concentration dispensed 50 µL each in advance into a 96-well microtiter plate, and the plate was incubate at room temperature for 1 hour. To the serum-free plate, only culture medium (100 µL / well) was dispensed into 96-well microtiter plate. MT-4 cells (3 × 104 cells / well) was infected with 3 µL / well of HIV solution diluted to an appropriate concentration (600 pfu / 50 µL) by the required number of wells and incubated at 37 ° C for 1 hour. The infected cells were centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded, and the infected cells were dispersed into culture medium for the required number of wells at 50 µL / well. Infected cell suspension was dispensed into a 96-well microtiter plate of which anti-HIV active substance and human serum prepared in advance. The cell mixture was mixed with a plate mixer and cultured in a CO2 incubator for 4 days. The EC50 in the presence of human serum was calculated in the same manner as in Test Example 1 and the ratio of EC50 in the presence of human serum and EC50 in the absence of human serum was calculated as the potency shift value. (Result) The potency shift value at the time of addition of 25% human serum EC50 are as described below.

In human plasma, the compound binds to serum proteins, the amount of free active compound in plasma was decreases and anti-viral activity may decrease. In the field of HIV, it is known that if the trough concentration in plasma exceeds the PA-EC90 (protein adjusted-EC90) value, the clinical efficacy would be obtained. In order to predict the clinical antiviral activity more accurately, PA-EC50 and/or PA-EC90 in the presence of 100% human serum was extrapolated from the following formula using the calculated potency shift value in the presence of 25% human serum.<img> id-imgb0481.tif </img>PA-EC50=EC50×potency shift value in the presence of 25% human serum×4<img> id-imgb0482.tif </img>PA-EC90=EC90×potency shift value in the presence of 25% human serum×4
As a result, the compound of the present invention showed preferable PA-EC50 value and/or PA-EC90 value.

The CYP3A4 fluorescent MBI test is to investigate the enhancement of CYP3A4 inhibition of a compound by a metabolism reaction. 7-Benzyloxytrifluoromethylcoumarin (7-BFC) is debenzylated by the CYP3A4 enzyme to produce 7-hydroxytrifluoromethylcoumarin (HFC), a metabolite emitting fluorescent light. The test was performed using 7-HFC-producing reaction as an index.
The reaction conditions were as follows: substrate 5.6µmol/L 7-BFC; pre-reaction time, 0 or 30 minutes; reaction time, 15 minutes; reaction temperature, 25°C (room temperature); CYP3A4 content (expressed in Eschericha coli), at pre-reaction 62.5pmol/mL, at reaction 6.25 pmol/mL (at 10-fold dilution); test drug concentration, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 µmol/L (six points).
An enzyme in a K-Pi buffer (pH 7.4) and a test drug solution as a pre-reaction solution were added to a 96-well plate so that it was 1/10 siluted by a substrate in a K-Pi buffer, NADPH as a co-factor was added to initiate a reaction as an index (without preincubation) and, after a predetermined time of a reaction, acetonitrile / 0.5mol/L Tris (trishydroxyaminomethane) = 4/1(V/V) was added to stop the reaction. In addition, NADPH was added to a remaining preincubation solution to initiate a preincubation (with preincubation) and, after a predetermined time of a preincubation, a part was transferred to another plate so that it was 1/10 siluted with a substrate and a K-Pi buffer to initiate a reaction as an index. After a predetermined time of a reaction, acetonitrile / 0.5mol/L Tris (trishydroxyaminomethane) = 4/1 was added to stop the reaction. For the plate on which each index reaction had been performed, a fluorescent value of 7-HFC which is a metabolite was measured with a fluorescent plate reader. (Ex = 420nm, Em = 535nm) Addition of only DMSO which is a solvent dissolving a drug to a reaction system was adopted as a control (100%), remaining activity (%) was calculated at each concentration of a test drug added as the solution, and IC50 was calculated by reverse-presumption by a logistic model using a concentration and an inhibition rate. A case where the difference of IC50 values was 5 µmol/L or more was defined as (+) and, a case where the difference was 3 µmol/L or less was defined as (-).

A part of pre-reaction solution was transferred to another 96-well plate, and 1/10 diluted by a substrate in K-Pi buffer NADPH as a co-factor was added in order to initiate a reaction as an index (without preincubation). After a predetermined time of a reaction, methanol/acetonitrile = 1/1 (V/V) solution was added in order to stop the reaction. On the other hand, NADPH was also added to a remaining pre-reaction solution in order to initiate a preincubation (with preincubation). After a predetermined time of a preincubation, a part was transferred to another 96-well plate, and 1/10 diluted by a substrate in K-Pi buffer in order to initiate a reaction as an index. After a predetermined time of a reaction, methanol/acetonitrile = 1/1 (V/V) solution was added in order to stop the reaction. After centrifuged at 3000rpm for 15 minutes, 1-hydroxymidazolam in the supernatant was quantified by LC/MS/MS.
The sample adding DMSO to a reaction system instead of a solution of the compound of the present invention was adopted as a control (100%) because DMSO was used as a solvent to dissolve the compound of the present invention. Remaining activity (%) was calculated at each concentration of the compound of the present invention added as the solution, and IC-value is calculated by reverse-presumption by a logistic model using a concentration and an inhibition rate. Shifted IC value was calculated as "IC of preincubation at 0min / IC of preincubation at 30min". When a shifted IC was 1.5 or more, this was defined as positive. When a shifted IC was 1.0 or less, this was defined as negative.

The bacteria was suspended in F buffer (K2HPO4: 3.5g/L, KH2PO4: 1g/L, (NH4)2SO4: 1g/L, trisodium citrate dihydrate: 0.25g/L, MgSO4·7H2O: 0.1g/L), and the suspension was added to 110mL of an Exposure medium (Micro F buffer containing Biotin: 8µg/mL, histidine: 0.2µg/mL, glucose: 8mg/mL). The TA100 strain was added to 120mL of the Exposure medium per 3.16mL of the bacterial solution to prepare a test bacterial solution. Each 12µL of a test substance DMSO solution (several stage dilution from maximum dose 50mg/mL at 2 to 3-fold ratio), DMSO as a negative control, 50µg/mL of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide DMSO solution for the TA98 strain, 0.25µg/mL of 2-(2-furyl)-3-(5-nitro-2-furyl)acrylamide DMSO solution for the TA100 strain each under the non-metabolism activating condition, 40µg/mL of 2-aminoanthracene DMSO solution for the TA98 strain, 20µg/mL of 2-aminoanthracene DMSO solution for the TA100 strain each under the metabolism condition all as a positive control, and 588µL of the test bacterial solution (a mixed solution of 498µl of the test bacterial solution and 90µL of S9 mix under the metabolism activating condition) were mixed, and this was shaking-cultured at 37°C for 90 minutes. 460µL of the bacterial solution exposed to the test substance was mixed with 2300µL of an Indicator medium (Micro F buffer containing biotin: 8µg/mL, histidine: 0.2µg/mL, glucose: 8mg/mL, Bromo Cresol Purple: 37.5µg/mL), each 50µL was dispensed into microplate 48 wells/dose, and this was subjected to stationary culturing at 37°C for 3 days. Since a well containing a bacterium which has obtained the proliferation ability by mutation of an amino acid (histidine) synthesizing enzyme gene turns from purple to yellow due to a pH change, the bacterium proliferation well which has turner to yellow in 48 wells per dose is counted, and was assessed by comparing with a negative control group.
