CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This non-provisional application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) to Patent Application No. 10-2016-0101545, filed in the Republic of Korea on Aug. 10, 2016, all of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference into the present application.
BACKGROUND
(a) Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to urea compounds having a protein kinase inhibitory activity and containing a 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidin-2(1H)-one skeleton, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds as active ingredients.
(b) Background Art
Protein kinases are enzymes that catalyze phosphorylation of the hydroxyl groups located on tyrosine, serine, and threonine residues of a protein and play an important role in growth factor signaling that leads to cellular growth, differentiation and proliferation.
In order to maintain homeostasis in a living body, in vivo signaling systems should be well balanced between their turn-ons and turn-offs. However, mutation or overexpression of a certain protein kinase disrupts a normal intracellular signaling system (predominantly into a state that an in vivo signaling is continued), thereby causing a variety of diseases, such as cancers, inflammation, metabolic diseases, and brain diseases. Representative protein kinases, which cause abnormal cell growth diseases, include Raf, KDR, Fms, Tie2, SAPK2a, Ret, Abl, Abl (T3151), ALK, Aurora A, Bmx, CDK/cyclinE, Kit, Src, EGFR, EphAl, FGFR3, FLT3, Fms, IGF-1R, IKKb, IR, Itk, JAK2, KDR, Met, mTOR, PDGFRa, Plk1, Ret, Syk, Tie2, TrtB, and the like. Thus, studies are underway to develop targeted anti-cancer drugs by developing compounds having a selective inhibitory activity against a specific kinase among several protein kinases.
On the other hand, acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is one of the deadly blood diseases and is a disease where blood cells constantly proliferate with abnormal differentiation. 16% or more of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have a point-mutated RAS (small G protein) protein, wherein among RAS isoforms, mutation of NRAS accounts for the majority (10% or more). For this reason, the NRAS G protein has been regarded as a promising drug target for the treatment of AML. When oncogenic RAS is mutated, RAS is continuously activated (gain-of-function), and various signaling systems downstream of RAS are activated to accelerate cancer cell growth.
Over the last 40 years, RAS point mutation species or key signaling molecules downstream of RAS have been proposed as targets. However, the complexity and compensation effects in the signaling systems of a mutant RAS have resulted in failure to lead to in vivo experiments and clinical trials. For example, selumetinib (AZD 6244) inhibiting MEK, a major molecule downstream of RAS, has not exhibited therapeutic effects in all three AML patients with a mutant NRAS gene in phase II. In addition, in an attempt to find targets, RNA interference screening was used to identify proteins (TBK1, STK33 and GATA2) which are genetically in a synthetic lethal relationship with mutation of KRAS. However, this also failed to achieve clinical therapeutic effects. In particular, in the case of STK33, it was proven through a cell-based pharmacologic screening at the preclinical stage that therapeutic strategies using mutation of KRAS and synthetic lethal principles cannot be established. Recently, a cell-based pharmacological screening was used to identify a compound (GNF 7) that selectively inhibits the signaling system of a mutant RAS, and its inhibitory effects in preclinical leukemia models have been observed. The action mechanism of the GNF 7 compound is to simultaneously inhibit both kinases, GCK and ACK1, which specifically contribute to cell growth downstream of the mutant RAS. This compound also exhibited its efficacy in cell samples from AML patients with actual NRAS mutants. Inhibitors for both kinases, GCK and ACK1, are known to be effective for the treatment of cancerous diseases caused by mutation of NRAS, such as melanoma, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, and various hematologic malignancies.
On the other hand, WO 2005-011597 (Patent Document 1) discloses an amide compound having 3,4-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d] pyrimidin-2(1H)-one as a mother nucleus structure, and discloses that the compound is effective for the treatment of diseases or symptoms caused by a kinase activity associated with Abl, BCR-Abl, and the like. However, the above-mentioned Patent Document 1 merely discloses that the amide compound is useful as a therapeutic agent for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), based on its BCR-Abl inhibitory activity.
