TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION
Described herein is a class of yellow imidazolium azo compounds that have a simplified chromophore and high relative solubility in aqueous systems, and that are surprisingly stable under in-use conditions. These are useful for dyeing fibers such as hair, wool, and keratinaceous materials. Also described herein are hair color compositions comprising the imidazolium azo compounds that may serve as hair dyes, and methods of using the same. These materials can be used with or without oxidant.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
In dye chemistry, use of heterocyclic components in the chromophore leads to pure, intense colors. Pure, intense yellows are particularly important in hair dyeing, because they are necessary to deliver attractive gold and warm shades that are rich and brilliant rather than muted, as when less pure colors are used. They not only are needed for adding brightness, but they also can be used to give the appearance of lightening. For yellow direct dyes, one of the challenges is that some of the heterocyclic moieties in dyes, such as thiazolium and pyridinium, can be unstable under in-use conditions. Described herein are yellow imidazolium chromophore compounds that address such challenges.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Described herein is a compound having a structure according to Formula V

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
While the specification concludes with claims which particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.
All percentages, parts and ratios are based upon the total weight of the compositions of the present invention, unless otherwise specified. All such weights as they pertain to listed ingredients are based on the active level and, therefore, do not include solvents or by-products that may be included in commercially available materials, unless otherwise specified. When more than one composition is used during a treatment, as in mixing of the components of a typical oxidative dye product, the total weight to be considered is the total weight of all the compositions applied on the hair simultaneously (i.e. the weight found “on head”) unless otherwise specified. The term “weight percent” may be denoted as “wt. %” herein.
As used herein, the term “hair” to be treated may be “living” i.e. on a living body or may be “non-living” i.e. in a wig, hairpiece or other aggregation of non-living keratinous fibers. Mammalian, particularly human, hair is preferred. However, wool, fur, and other keratin containing fibers are suitable substrates for the compositions according to the present invention.
As used herein, the term “chromophore” means the part of the direct dye compound responsible for its color.
As used herein, the term “direct dye compound” means a dye used in a process in which dye molecules are attracted by physical forces at the molecular level to a textile or substrate such as the hair. As opposed to oxidative dyes, there is no chemical reaction required to form the chromophore. Additionally, there is no covalent bond formation between the direct dye and the substrate as opposed to reactive dyes. The direct dye compound does not undergo a chemical transformation before and after the dyeing process.
As used herein, the term “core structure” means the chromophore including one or two permanent cations that are pendant to the chromophore or part of the chromophore. In an embodiment, the chromophore is charged. In an embodiment, the chromophore is not charged as the permanent cation is pendant to the chromophore.
As used herein, the term “pendant” means when a functional group is linked to a core structure via covalent bond.
As used herein, the terms “in-use stability” means less than about 6% loss recorded at 30 minutes in the presence of a 3% H2O2 solution at pH10.6.
The hair colorant compounds described herein comprise one or more washfast direct dyes, optionally, oxidative dyes as well. In an embodiment the hair colorant compositions exhibit in-use stability and/or storage stability.
With regards to the direct dye compounds described herein, numerous tautomeric compounds may be involved. Thus, for example, 2-mercaptopyridine (I) may exist under known conditions in the pyridine-2-thione tautomer form (II).
<img> id-US20180079907A1-20180322-C00002.TIF </img>
It is to be understood that when this development refers to a particular structure, all of the reasonable additional tautomeric structures are included. In the art, tautomeric structures are frequently represented by one single structure and the method described herein follows this general practice.
It is also understood that within the scope of this invention, E, Z isomers may be involved. Thus, for example, (E)-diphenyldiazene (III) converts under known conditions to (Z)-diphenyldiazene (IV), which is also reversible.

When a salt of Formula (V), described below, contains a cationic moiety, anionic counterions include, for example, D,L-malate, L-malate, D-malate, chloride, bromide, citrate, acetate, lactate, succinate, tartrate, phosphate, hemisulfate, sulfate, methylsulfate, trifluoroacetate, iodide, and mixtures thereof.

Data
In-Use Disappearance
Disappearance of the dye is measured on a Cary 100 UV/visible spectrophotometer at 25° C. A solution of the dye in water at a concentration sufficient to give an absorbance of 2.0 at the dye's λmax and buffered at pH 10.6 with ammonia is mixed with an equal volume of 6% hydrogen peroxide in a 1 cm quartz cuvette. The absorbance is measured at the λmax at zero (A0) and thirty minutes (A30) reaction time. Percent disappearance is calculated as the difference between the starting and thirty-minute absorbances divided by the starting absorbance minus the baseline absorbance (Ab), by the following equation:

Results are reported in Table 2 below.
Color Intensity
The exemplary formulations indicated above are formulated with yellow imidazolium azo dyes. These are applied directly to fabric test cloth, and then rinsed with water after thirty minutes. The resulting color is measured using a colorimeter with D65 illumination and characterized by the L* value. An L* of 100 is considered white and L* of 0 is considered black, therefore the higher the L* value the lower the color intensity. The measured L* values for different compounds of the present invention are summarized in Table 1 below.
