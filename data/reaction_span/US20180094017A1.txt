TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to an oligonucleotide derivative, an oligonucleotide construct using the same, and methods for producing them.
BACKGROUND ART
In recent years, various oligonucleotides such as DNAs and RNAs have come to be used for treatment, diagnosis, etc. For example, specific gene knockdown techniques using RNA interference (RNAi) have attracted attention as nucleic-acid technologies. RNAi is a phenomenon in which the function of a gene is inhibited by the action of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) having a sequence homologous to the gene. Nucleic acid medicines using this RNAi are highly expected as next-generation therapeutic medicines.
On the other hand, studies have also been made to chemically modify oligonucleotides to impart new functions that natural forms do not have. The present inventors have also developed a technique for introducing an ethynyl group at the end of an oligonucleotide and further modifying the ethynyl group with a new substituent, such as a benzene ring, by utilizing a click reaction (Patent Literature 1). Further, it has been revealed that an artificial oligonucleotide obtained by this technique has higher nuclease resistance than a natural oligonucleotide and is less likely to be decomposed in cells.
However, a nucleic acid itself is negatively charged and cannot pass through the cell membrane. Therefore, nucleic acid medicines require a drug delivery system (DDS) that allows nucleotides to pass through the cell membrane. At present, a lipofection technique using liposomes has been developed as a technique for introducing nucleotides into cells. In this technique, a complex is formed by binding a positively-charged cationic liposome around negatively-charged DNA to allow the DNA etc. to be incorporated into cells through cell surfaces by an endocytosis phenomenon.
However, there is a problem that a lipofection reagent used in the lipofection technique is toxic to the liver and the kidney. Further, the lipofection technique is a DDS utilizing mere endocytosis, and therefore lacks in cell selectivity.
In order to solve these problems, a chemically-modified oligonucleotide has been developed which is obtained by introducing asialoglycopeptide chains at the 3' end of an oligonucleotide so as to be introduced into cells through an asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) (Patent Literatures 2 and 3). However, as shown in FIG. 4, a chemically-modified oligonucleotide obtained by this method has a complicated chemical structure having three asialoglycopeptide chains, and its synthesis requires complicated operations.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION
Technical Problems
In view of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel oligonucleotide derivative that can be easily synthesized and that can be introduced into cells without using a lipofection reagent.
Solutions to Problems
As described above, the present inventors have succeeded in introducing an ethynyl group into an oligonucleotide (Patent Literature 1). Therefore, the present inventors have tried to further bind a saccharide, a peptide chain, or a natural compound to this ethynyl group by a click reaction. This is because it is known that many receptors that recognize a specific saccharide are present on cell membrane surfaces (e.g., desmin and vimentin present on the surfaces of hepatocytes etc. are known to selectively recognize N-acetylglucosamine), and therefore drug delivery via receptors that recognize a sugar chain can be expected. The same can be expected for a peptide chain and a natural compound. As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have found that when a saccharide, a peptide chain, or a natural compound is bound to an ethynyl group-modified oligonucleotide by a click reaction, a sugar-modified oligonucleotide derivative can be easily synthesized in good yield. Further, the present inventors have found that a siRNA modified with this oligonucleotide derivative can be introduced into cells without using a lipofection reagent. These findings have led to the completion of the present invention.
More specifically, an oligonucleotide derivative according to a first aspect of the present invention is represented by the following formula (1). Here, a saccharide substituent represented by S in the formula includes a disaccharide substituent and a polysaccharide substituent as well as a monosaccharide substituent. Further, the sugar substituent includes also an amino sugar and an amino sugar derivative having an acylated amino group.
wherein R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or a phosphate group; a, b, and c are independently integers of 0 or more, and at least one of them is 1 or more; A and B are independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides whose total chain length is 3 or more, and A and B do not contain hydroxyl groups at 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide; S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group; and an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to a benzene ring.
Further, an oligonucleotide derivative according to a second aspect of the present invention is represented by the following formula (2). Here, S in the formula is a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group, and the sugar substituent includes a disaccharide substituent and a polysaccharide substituent as well as a monosaccharide substituent. Further, the sugar substituent includes also an amino sugar and an amino sugar derivative having an acylated amino group.
wherein R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or a phosphate group; a, b, and c are independently integers of 0 or more, and at least one of them is 1 or more; A and B are independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides whose total chain length is 3 or more, and A and B do not contain hydroxyl groups at 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide; an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to a benzene ring; S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group; n represents a natural number of 0 to 4; LINKER represents a linker; andX represents any one of
wherein carbon marked with α is bound to a triazole ring, and fluorine and/or an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to X.
When S in the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention is a sugar substituent, the sugar substituent may be one represented by the following chemical structural formula (3) or (3'):
X═O or NH; and
R3 and R4 are each independently H, Ac, or COCF3 (R3=H, Ac, or COCF3; R4═H, Ac, or COCF3).
When the sugar substituent S has an acyl group, the acyl group may be modified with a fluorine atom (e.g., a trifluoroacetyl group). When a fluorine atom is introduced into the sugar substituent, hydrophobicity can be increased. Therefore, it is considered that when a receptor on a cell membrane surface easily receives a hydrophobic functional group, permeability is increased.
An oligonucleotide derivative according to a third aspect of the present invention is represented by the following formula:
wherein R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or a phosphate group; a, b, and c are independently integers of 0 or more, and at least one of them is 1 or more; A and B are independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides whose total chain length is 3 or more, and A and B do not contain hydroxyl groups at 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide; an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to a benzene ring; LINKER represents a linker; andX represents any one of
wherein carbon marked with α is bound to a triazole ring, and fluorine and/or an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to X.
Further, R1 and R2 in the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention may be H. Further, b may be 0. Further, both a and b may be 0. Further, c may be 1 or more and 5 or less.
Further, A and B may have a partial sequence of mRNA of a predetermined gene or its complementary sequence. In this case, RNA interference can be exerted on the mRNA, and therefore protein synthesis by the target mRNA can be inhibited.
Further, the total chain length of A and B may be 10 or more and 35 or less. Usually, siRNAs and miRNAs have lengths within this range, and can inhibit protein synthesis by their target RNA.
Further, A and B may be oligoribonucleotides.
The oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention can be used to regulate gene expression. That is, an oligonucleotide construct according to the present invention is an oligonucleotide construct for regulating gene expression, and comprises the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention. Specific examples of the application of such an oligonucleotide construct for regulating gene expression include single- and double-stranded DNAs, single- and double-stranded RNAs, DNA/RNA chimeras, and DNA/RNA hybrids. Other examples of the application include antigenes, antisenses, aptamers, siRNAs, miRNAs, shRNAs, and ribozymes.
Further, the oligonucleotide construct according to the present invention may have a unit represented by the following formula (4) or (5) at a dangling end:
wherein S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group;n represents a natural number of 0 to 4; LINKER represents a linker; and
wherein carbon marked with α is bound to a triazole ring, and fluorine and/or an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to X.

The oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention may be used as an oligonucleotide construct for genetic diagnosis. Further, this construct may be a probe.

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS
(Oligonucleotide Derivative)
An oligonucleotide derivative according to a first aspect of the present invention is represented by the following formula (1), and an oligonucleotide derivative according to a second aspect of the present invention is represented by the following formula (2):
wherein R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or a phosphate group; a, b, and c are independently integers of 0 or more, and at least one of them is 1 or more; A and B are independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides whose total chain length is 3 or more, and A and B do not contain hydroxyl groups at 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide; S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group; an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to a benzene ring,wherein R1 and R2 each independently represent hydrogen or a phosphate group; a, b, and c are independently integers of 0 or more, and at least one of them is 1 or more; A and B are independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides whose total chain length is 3 or more, and A and B do not contain hydroxyl groups at 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide; an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to a benzene ring; S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group; n represents a natural number of 0 to 4; LINKER represents a linker; andX represents any one of
wherein carbon marked with α is bound to a triazole ring, and fluorine and/or an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to X.
The oligonucleotide derivative according to the first aspect of the present invention has a partial structure represented by the following formula (4) at at least one of the both ends and middle of the oligonucleotide derivative. Further, the oligonucleotide derivative according to the second aspect of the present invention has a partial structure represented by the following formula (5) at at least one of the both ends and middle of the oligonucleotide derivative. When such a partial structure has a sugar substituent, the oligonucleotide derivative can be introduced into cells through ligands on cell membrane surfaces, such as vimentin and an asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR). Also when S is a peptide chain or a tocopherol-binding group, similar cell membrane permeability can be expected. Further, improvement in nuclease resistance can be expected due to the presence of such an artificial partial structure. Such a partial structure can be introduced into an oligonucleotide of known or unknown sequence by any one of addition, substitution, and insertion or a combination of two or more of them. It is to be noted that the term “oligonucleotide” as used herein is a concept including a modified oligonucleotide.
wherein S represents a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a tocopherol-binding group;n represents a natural number of 0 to 4; and LINKER represents a linker.
wherein carbon marked with α is bound to a triazole ring, and fluorine and/or an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen bound to X.
The sugar substituent in the above (4) and (5) is not particularly limited, and may be a monosaccharide such as glucose, fructose, galactose, mannose, fucose, glucosamine, fructosamine, galactosamine, or mannosamine, or an oligosaccharide of dimer or higher oligomer such as sucrose, lactose, or maltose. Further, the sugar substituent may be an amino sugar or an amino sugar in which an acyl group has been bound to an amino group. In this case, a fluorine element may be bound to the acyl group.
Further, the linker in the (5) is not particularly limited as long as it is a linker that can be adapted to a sugar substituent, a peptide chain, or a hydroxyl group of tocopherol. Examples of the linker will be shown below (in the formulas, n is a natural number). The linker increases the degree of freedom of movement of a sugar substituent or a peptide chain. Therefore, it can be considered that the introduction of the linker makes it easy to bind a sugar substituent or a peptide chain to a ligand (receptor) on the cell membrane.

Examples of the linker used when S is a peptide chain
(A Linker that Binds to the Sulfur Element of Cystine)
In the partial structures represented by the above formulas (4) and (5), two “-CH2O-” groups and a triazole ring on a benzene ring may be bound to any positions on the benzene ring. Further, an alkyl group may be bound instead of hydrogen directly bound to the benzene ring. Examples of the alkyl group include alkyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Specific examples of such an alkyl group include a methyl group, an ethyl group, a n-propyl group, a n-butyl group, an isobutyl group, and a tert-butyl group.
Further, when this partial structure (4) or (5) is provided at the 5' end of an oligonucleotide, resistance to exonuclease that acts on the 5' end is effectively imparted. On the other hand, when provided at the 3' end of an oligonucleotide, this partial structure (4) or (5) is effective for exonuclease that acts on the 3' end, and is effective for improving the silencing effect of RNAi. Therefore, for example, when resistance to nuclease that acts on the 3' end needs to be improved, a and b may be 0. On the other hand, when resistance to nuclease that acts on the 5' end needs to be improved, b and c may be 0. Further, when nuclease resistance needs to be achieved, a, b, and c shall each be at least 1, but a, b, and c may each be 2 or more, or a total of any two of a, b, and c may be 2 or more.
Further, when this partial structure (4) or (5) is provided at a site other than the both ends of an oligonucleotide, endonuclease resistance can be effectively imparted to a site other than the 3' and 5' ends of the oligonucleotide.
Further, the number and positions of the partial structures (4) or (5) in the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention are determined in consideration of nuclease resistance and the effect of introduction of the partial structure (4) or (5) on the oligonucleotide derivative. For example, when a siRNA or a shRNA is constructed using the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, a and b may be 0, and 1 to 3 (c=1 to 3), preferably 1 or 2 (c=1, 2) partial structures (U) may be added to the 3' end of a 3' dangling end nucleotide (e.g., dT (deoxythymidine)) of such a construct, or one or both of, for example, two dT nucleotides of a siRNA may be replaced with the partial structures (4) or (5) (c=1, 2). Further, the partial structure (4) or (5) may be inserted at the 3' dangling end. The mode in which an existing nucleotide is replaced with the partial structure (4) or (5) has an advantage that the chain length of a siRNA is not increased.
Further, when an anti-gene, an antisense, an aptamer, a miRNA, or a ribozyme is constructed using the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, the partial structure (4) or (5) may be appropriately provided, if necessary. For example, in the case of an antisense RNA, the partial structures (4) or (5) can be formed on the 3' and 5' end sides. Further, in the case of an aptamer or a ribozyme, the partial structure (4) or (5) provided at a site other than the 5' and 3' ends may be effective. Further, in the case of a probe, the partial structure (4) or (5) may be provided on one or both of the 3' and 5' end sides.
In the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, A and B are each independently modified or unmodified oligonucleotides, and may be the same or different. The term “oligonucleotide” as used herein refers to a polymer having nucleotides, which are monomers generally constituting an oligonucleotide or a polynucleotide, as monomer units. Further, the term “nucleotide” refers to a deoxyribonucleotide and/or a ribonucleotide as a monomer unit. In general, a polymer having deoxyribonucleotides, which are nucleotides, as monomer units is referred to as DNA, and a polymer having ribonucleotides, which are nucleotides, as monomer units is referred to as RNA. However, the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention includes not only so-called DNAs and RNAs but also oligomers of monomer units thereof. Further, the oligonucleotide includes also RNA/DNA chimeras. Further, the modified or unmodified oligonucleotide includes not only oligonucleotides made of only nucleotides containing natural bases such as guanine, cytosine, thymine, adenine, uracil, and methyl cytosine that are purines and pyrimidines but also oligonucleotides having one or two or more nucleotides chemically modified at any of the base moiety, sugar moiety, and phosphate moiety thereof.
In the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, each of the base sequence of the oligonucleotide A and the base sequence of the oligonucleotide B or a combination of them may have a partial sequence of sense or antisense strand of DNA or mRNA of a predetermined gene or a complementary sequence thereof. Such complementarity allows hybridization with a target nucleic acid of any kind, which makes it possible to allow the oligonucleotide derivative to fulfill its intended function. In the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, the length of A and B is not particularly limited, and can be set according to the intended use. However, in consideration of the ease of synthesis of an oligonucleotide and the fulfillment of an expected effect, the length of A and B is preferably 10 or more and 35 or less. Further, in the case of an antisense, the length of A and B may be about 10 or more and 30 or less. In the case of a siRNA, the total chain length of A and B is preferably 15 or more and 35 or less, more preferably 30 or less. Further, in the case of a primer, the total chain length of A and B is 10 or more and 30 or less, and in the case of a probe, the total chain length of A and B is preferably 10 or more and 30 or less.
When the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention is used for, for example, a siRNA, an shRNA, an antisense, a ribozyme, or an aptamer, the monomer units of A and B may be modified or unmodified oligoribonucleotides.
(Oligonucleotide Construct)
An oligonucleotide construct according to the present invention has one or two or more kinds of the oligonucleotide derivatives according to the present invention. Depending on the type of the oligonucleotide derivative or the combination of the oligonucleotide derivatives in the oligonucleotide construct, the oligonucleotide construct may have a single form of single-stranded DNA, double-stranded DNA, single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, DMA/RNA chimera, or DNA/RNA hybrid or a combination form of two or more of them. As has been described above, since the oligonucleotide moiety constituting the oligonucleotide derivative includes a modified oligonucleotide, the oligonucleotide construct may contain a modified oligonucleotide.
The oligonucleotide construct having any of such forms preferably has the partial structure (4) or (5) at a site that may be a target of nuclease. These partial structures can be provided at a terminal mismatch or dangling end. Considering exonuclease resistance, the partial structure (4) or (5) is preferably provided at a dangling end. Further, the partial structure (4) or (5) can be provided in a bulge, mismatch internal loop, hair pin loop, or the like.
The oligonucleotide construct according to the present invention has improved nuclease resistance, and therefore can be used for various applications such as regulation of gene expression, research, and diagnosis. Examples of the application of the oligonucleotide construct for regulating gene expression include anti-genes, antisenses, aptamers, siRNAs, miRNAs, shRNAs, and ribozymes. In particular, in the case of siRNAs and shRNAs, both nuclease resistance and silencing activity can be improved by substitutionally or additionally introducing the partial structure (4) or (5) into dT at a 3' overhang end.
FIG. 1 shows an example of a siRNA having the partial structures (4) at its 3' ends. Further, an example of the oligonucleotide construct for diagnosis or research includes a probe. A probe is an oligonucleotide that has a sequence specific to a target nucleic acid defined by design or selection and that is obtained so as to hybridize with the target nucleic acid under predetermined stringency conditions. A probe constructed using the oligonucleotide derivative has enhanced nuclease resistance, and therefore the effect of nuclease contained in a sample containing a target nucleic acid can be reduced or avoided. Therefore, a sample can be prepared even when nuclease is poorly removed or nuclease removal treatment is omitted. As a result, a genetic diagnosis or examination can be performed easily.

Further, an oligonucleotide derivative having a unit of the partial structure (4) or (5) on its 3' end side can be obtained by a click reaction between an oligonucleotide having an ethynyl group at its 5' end obtained by a conventional nucleic acid synthesis method and the compound (6) or (7). Further, an oligonucleotide derivative having the partial structure (4) or (5) at a site other than its 3' and 5' ends can be obtained by a click reaction between an oligonucleotide having an ethynyl group at a site other than its 3' and 5' ends and the compound (6) or (7) according to the present invention.
(Method for Modifying Oligonucleotide)
An oligonucleotide can be modified by introducing at least one partial structure (4) or (5) into an oligonucleotide of known or unknown sequence by any of addition, substitution, and insertion or a combination of two or more of them. Such modification makes it possible to obtain an RNA construct having high silencing effect in addition to nuclease resistance. The introduction of the partial structure (4) or (5) may be performed in accordance with the method for producing an oligonucleotide derivative.
(Use of Oligonucleotide Derivative)
The oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention can be used as a gene expression inhibitor when constructed so as to function as a siRNA, an antisense, or the like.

Synthesis of AS
AS was synthesized using a DNA automatic synthesizer (ABI 3400 DNA Synthesizer; Applied Biosystems) on a scale of 1 μmol of a dT-modified solid-phase carrier (Glen Research). First, dT-CE Phosphoramidite (Glen Research) and RNA Phosphoramidite (Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared in a 0.1 M acetonitrile solution. The coupling time of the phosphoramidites was set to 20 minutes. The synthesis was terminated in a state where a DMTr group was removed. The cleavage of AS from the solid-phase carrier and deprotection were performed in accordance with standard methods. The residue after drying under reduced pressure was purified by 20% denatured PAGE. The band of the AS was excised and shaken overnight in a gel elution buffer (0.1 N TEAA (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA). The AS was recovered from the gel elution buffer using a Sep-Pak (trademark) tC18 reversed phase column. The structure of the purified AS was confirmed by MALDI-TOF/Ms (AXIMA-CFR plus; Shimadzu Corporation).
Synthesis of 51
Synthesis of 51 was performed using 1 μmol of the solid-phase carrier compound 8. The other conditions and the structure confirmation method are the same as those used in the synthesis of AS.
Synthesis of S2
Synthesis of S2 was performed using 1 μmol of the solid-phase carrier compound 8. The compound 13 was prepared and used as a 0.15 M acetonitrile solution. The other conditions and the structure confirmation method are the same as those used in the synthesis of AS.
Synthesis of S3
Synthesis of S3 was performed using 1 μmol of the solid-phase carrier compound 8. The compound 13 was prepared and used as a 0.15 M acetonitrile solution. The other conditions and the structure confirmation method are the same as those used in the synthesis of AS.
Synthesis of S3-GlcNAc
The S3 (2 mM solution in H2O, 1 μL, 2 nmol), 1,3,4-tri-O-acetyl-2-acetamido-6-azido-β-D-glucopyranose (9) (10 mM solution in DMSO, 3 μL, 30 nmol), and acetonitrile (2.2 μL) were added to sterilized 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (2.2 μL) and sterilized water (9.6 μL) in an Eppendorf tube, and were stirred for 1 minute by a vortex mixer. Then, sodium ascorbate (100 mM solution in H2O, 2 μL, 200 nmol) and copper sulfate pentahydrate (100 mM solution in H2O, 2 μL, 200 nmol) were added in order, and the mixture was stirred for 1 minute by a vortex mixer and allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Purification was performed by HPLC to obtain a desired product (S3-GlcNAc).
<Evaluation of Ability to Inhibit Gene Expression by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay>
Each of the antisense strand AS and the sense strand S3-GlcNAc synthesized in such a manner as described above was transferred to an Eppendorf tube in an amount of 210 pmol, dried, and dissolved in siRNA buffer (GE Dharmacon) (100 μL), and the solution was heated at 100° C. for 5 minutes and then allowed to stand for 1 hour or more to form a double strand. Each of the 2.1 μM samples was diluted 10-fold and 100-fold to prepare samples for assay.
Further, a siRNA (having TT as dangling end nucleotides in both strands) was synthesized from the antisense strand AS and a sense strand complementary to the antisense strand AS by the same method and used as a control.
HeLa cells (provided from NIH) were suspended in OPTI-MEM at 4000 cells/45 μL on the day before introduction of siRNA, and then 0.1 μg/μL psi-CHECK (registered trademark)-2 vector (Promega) (18 μL), TransFast (registered trademark) Transfection Reagent (Promega) (27 Opti-MEM (registered trademark) (Life Technologies) (315 μL) were added. Then, 50 μL of the cell suspension was placed in each well of a 96 well plate and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Then, 15% BS in DMEM (100 μL) was added, and the cell suspension was cultured for 24 hours.
Introduction of siRNA was performed by two methods, one of which used a transfection reagent and the other of which did not. That is, when a transfection reagent was used, siRNA was transfected in different amounts into cells using OPTI-MEM and TransFast. When a transfection reagent was not used, siRNA was mixed in different amounts with DMEM, and the mixture was added to the cells. After 4 hours, 10% BS in DMEM (100 μL) was added, and the cells were cultured for 48 hours.
After the 48-hour cultivation, the medium was sucked out, and the cells were frozen at −80° C. On the next day, the ability to inhibit gene expression was evaluated using Dual-Glo (registered trademark) Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The evaluation was made in accordance with protocols provided by Promega.
The results are shown in FIG. 2.
When a lipofection reagent was not used, the activity of Luciferase was reduced as the amount of the siRNA, having S3-GluNAc as a sense strand, added was increased from 10 nM to 50 nM and 100 nM. From the result, it was revealed that the siRNA fulfilled the function of silencing a gene associated with Luciferase. However, in the case of the control siRNA whose sense strand had TT as its dangling end nucleotides, the activity of Luciferase was not reduced even when the amount of the control siRNA added was increased from 10 nM to 50 nM and 100 nM, and therefore the siRNA did not fulfill the function of silencing a gene associated with Luciferase.
On the other hand, when a lipofection reagent was used, both the siRNAs fulfilled the function of silencing a gene associated with Luciferase.
The above results are interpreted as follows. That is, as shown in FIG. 3, the siRNA having S3-GlcNAc as a sense strand binds to a specific ligand that is present on the cell membrane surfaces of HeLa cells and that recognizes an amino sugar chain, and is introduced into the cells by endocytosis mediated by this ligand. This indicates the possibility that a siRNA using the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention selectively binds to a ligand and is selectively delivered into cells. Further, it is considered that such a delivery system can be applied not only to siRNAs but also to anti-genes, antisenses, aptamers, miRNAs, shRNAs, and the like.
<Oligonucleotide Derivative Obtained by Introducing Trifluoroacetyl Group>
In the oligonucleotide derivative according to the present invention, an amino sugar substituent S having a trifluoroacetylated amino group (see the following partial structure b) may be used instead of an amino sugar substituent S having an acetylated amino group (see the following partial structure a).

The trifluoroacetylglucosamine derivatives 20 and 27 obtained in such a manner as described above can readily modify oligonucleotides by a click reaction using the azide group present in their molecules as a foothold. The thus modified oligonucleotide derivative is recognized by a receptor that is present on cell membrane surfaces and that recognizes an amino sugar, and is therefore easily taken into the nuclei of cells by endocytosis. Therefore, the modified oligonucleotide derivative can be expected to be introduced into cells without using a lipofection reagent. Further, it is considered that when a receptor on cell membrane surfaces easily receives a hydrophobic functional group, permeability is increased due to an increase in hydrophobicity achieved by the introduction of fluorine atoms.

The sugar- or RGD peptide-modified RNA and RNA having a fluorescein-modified 5' end were annealed in PBS buffer to form a duplex.
The modified RNA duplex was dissolved in OPTI-MEM to a final concentration of 400 nM, and the solution was added to HeLa cells. A positive control was also prepared by introducing an unmodified fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex (final concentration: 100 nM) into HeLa cells using TransFast (Promega). A negative control was also prepared by adding, to HeLa cells, a solution obtained by dissolving an unmodified fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex in OPTI-MEM to a final concentration of 400 nM. After 4 hours, uptake of the modified RNA duplex into HeLa cells was observed using a confocal microscope (LSM 710, Carl Zeiss).
The results are shown in FIG. 5.
In the case of the positive control using a lipofection reagent, the green fluorescence of fluorescein of the fluorescein labeled-RNA duplex (X=dTdT) was observed in the cells. However, in the case of the negative control using no lipofection reagent, green fluorescence of the fluorescein-labeled RNA duplex (X=dTdT) was observed only outside the cells. On the other hand, when the sugar- or peptide-modified RNA duplex was used, green fluorescence was observed also in the cells as in the case of the positive control. This revealed that the sugar- or peptide-modified RNA duplex was taken into the cells even without a lipofection reagent.
