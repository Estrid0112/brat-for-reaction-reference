Dichloromethane (2.0 L, 8 V) and compound 1.1 (250.0 g, 826.5 mmol) were added to a 5 L three-necked flask, and stirred and heated until dissolved. Concentrated sulfuric acid (124.0 g, 1240.0 mmol, 98%) was dropwise added to the reaction solution. The reaction solution was heated to reflux, stirred for 4 h, and the reaction was stopped.
After the reaction solution was cooled, it was slowly poured into 1 L of iced water and stirred for 5 min, followed by the dropwise addition of saturated sodium carbonate solution to adjust pH to 7 to 8. The mixture was transferred to a separatory funnel and was extracted twice with CH2Cl2 (200 mL, 0.8 V), and the organic phase was combined. The organic phase was washed with water (500 mL, 2 V) and saturated brine (500 mL, 2 V) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After drying, the organic phase was obtained by filtration. The organic phase was removed by rotary evaporation to obtain a crude product. At room temperature, the crude product was beating washed with Ethyl acetate (375 mL, 1.5 V) for 12 h and filtered. The filter cake was washed with ethyl acetate (50 mL, 0.2 V), drained, and vacuum dried under 20-40° C. to obtain compound 1.2 (211.0 g, yield: 89.7%).

Example 12: Synthesis of Crude Deoxycholic Acid
Compound 6 (100g, 196 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (600 g, 6 V) and methanol (600 mL, 6 V) were added to a 2,000 ml three-necked round bottom flask, and stirred for dissolving. The system temperature was maintained below 25° C. 4 mol/L sodium hydroxide solution (196 ml, 784 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred for 24 hours at a temperature of 20-30 ° C. The completion of reaction was monitored by HPLC. After water (800 ml, 8V) was added to decrease the system temperature to 10-15° C., 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to adjust pH to 9-10. Organic solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, cooled to 10-25° C., and washed twice with dichloromethane (500 ml*2). The pH was adjusted to 1 to 2 with 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid, stirred for 2 hours and filtered. The filtrate was washed with water (500 ml, 5 V), drained, and forcedly air dried to obtain 101 g of solid. Under 15-25° C., the product was dissolved in methyl tert-butyl ether (1,000 ml, 10 V), stirred for 12 hours or more, and filtered. After the filter cake was washed with methyl tert-butyl ether (400 ml, 4V), it was forcedly air dried to obtain a crude product of deoxycholic acid (73.1 g, 95%).
Example 13: Purification of Deoxycholic Acid
Crude deoxycholic acid (100 g, 196 mmol) and dichloromethane solution (1500 ml, 15 V) with 10% methanol were added to a 2,000 ml three-necked round bottom flask, and heated and stirred for dissolving. The insoluble was removed by filtration, and proceeded with distillation by heating, with dropwise addition of dichloromethane (2000 ml ) at the same time, ensuring the consistency between the rates of dropwise addition and of liquid distillation. The methanol content passing through the gas phase measurement system was between 2.5% and 3%. The temperature was lowered to 5-10° C., stirred for 2 hours and then filtered. The filter cake was washed with dichloromethane (200 ml, 2 V), and forcedly air dried. The maximum single impurity as determined by HPLC (ELSD) was below 0.1%. The resulting product (dichloromethane) was added to water (1,000 ml), and a sodium hydroxide solution was added to adjust pH to 9-10. Then 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid was added to adjust pH to 1-2. After stirring for 2 hours at 10 to 25° C., perform filtration and the filter cake was washed with water (500 ml). The filter cake was then pulped with pure water (2,000 ml, 20 V) for 4-8 h at 60-80° C., and then filtered and drained. After drying, pure product of deoxycholic acid was obtained (92 g, yield: 92%).
