TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a method for producing 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine or a salt thereof, and use thereof.
BACKGROUND ART
1-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine and salts thereof are compounds that are useful as an intermediate in the synthesis of various pharmaceutical compositions (preferably antitubercular agents), agricultural chemicals, etc.
A method comprising reacting a cyclohexanedione compound and an amine compound under neutral or basic conditions is known as a method for producing 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine (Patent Literature (PTL) 1).
Since this method requires oxidizing an intermediate with oxygen to obtain the desired product, an operation of passing air or oxygen through the reaction system is essential. However, the operation of passing air or oxygen through the reaction system requires a special device, as well as complicated steps of supplying an appropriate amount of oxygen in accordance with the progress of the reaction. When oxygen is not present in the reaction system, the reaction progresses only up to the formation of an imine, and thus fails to efficiently obtain the desired product.
Further, to supply oxygen to the reaction system, oxygen must be dissolved in a solvent. Therefore, a certain amount of solvent is necessary for the reaction. Further, to supplement the solvent that decreases mainly due to evaporation by aeration, appropriately adding the solvent is also required. Accordingly, the amount of organic solvent used inevitably becomes large, which is environmentally unfriendly. Furthermore, when this reaction is carried out on a large scale, performing the reaction with good repeatability is difficult. In addition, since the reaction requires heating in the presence of an organic solvent and oxygen for a long time, anti-combustion measures must also be taken.
Further, since the cyclohexanedione compound, used as a reactant, is a compound obtained from the corresponding aromatic compound by adding high-pressure hydrogen, the method disclosed in PTL 1 is not preferable in terms of supplied amount and cost. The desired aminophenol compound, which has an electron-rich aromatic ring, is extremely unstable to oxidizing conditions. Therefore, even if the conditions are highly optimized, the oxidation reaction progresses excessively under oxygen oxidation conditions, and purification of by-products is inevitable, thus requiring a great deal of labor for complicated purification of byproducts, management for preventing oxidation byproducts, etc.
Thus, the method disclosed in PTL 1 has unsolved problems in terms of costs, supplied amount, etc., and is not an industrially preferable method.
As methods for introducing an amino group into an aromatic compound, reaction systems using a metal catalyst or the like are also known. However, such a method is not industrially preferable, because using a metal catalyst increases the number of steps and costs. All such known methods have high production costs, and a more inexpensive production method has been desired for pharmaceutical compositions assumed to be supplied to developing countries, such as antitubercular agents.
Patent Literature (PTL) 2 discloses a method for producing a specific N,N-dialkylaminophenol by reacting a dihydric phenol with a specific secondary amine. However, this method does not produce 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine. Furthermore, in order to prevent the reduction of reaction efficiency due to increased basicity of the reaction system, this method requires using a secondary amine in an amount that is more than the amount of dihydric phenol.

(hereinafter sometimes referred to as “a piperidine compound of Formula (3)”)or a salt thereof.
The hydroquinone or a salt thereof and the piperidine compound of Formula (3) or a salt thereof can be heated under catalyst-free and solvent-free conditions.
Heating is usually performed to such an extent that the reaction proceeds. For example, the heating is performed at or above the temperature at which a mixture of the hydroquinone or a salt thereof and the piperidine compound of Formula (3) or a salt thereof is dissolved (e.g., about 150° C. or higher). The upper limit is not particularly limited. The heating temperature is generally about 300° C. or less from the viewpoint of energy efficiency. More specifically, the heating temperature is about 150 to 300° C., more preferably about 150 to 250° C., and still more preferably about 180 to 210° C.
The compound of Formula (3) or a salt thereof, and the compound of Formula (2) (hydroquinone) or a salt thereof, which are reactants in the reaction, are both solids at room temperature. The reaction steps are not particularly limited. For example, the reaction can be performed by adding both reactants to a reactor kettle at room temperature, and then raising the temperature. Further, from the viewpoint of reaction efficiency, both reactants are preferably mixed (i.e., formed into a mixture) before reaction.
The heating time of the reaction is not particularly limited, as long as the reaction sufficiently proceeds. For example, heating for 1 hour or more is preferable. The upper limit of the heating time is usually 24 hours or less from the viewpoint of energy efficiency etc. More specifically, the reaction time is preferably 1 to 24 hours, and more preferably 1 to 6 hours or 2 to 3 hours.
When the temperature is within the above-mentioned range, the reaction usually is completed in about 1 to 3 hours. Byproduct formation can be prevented by performing the reaction within the temperature range described above and completing the reaction in a short period of time.
The reaction can also be performed in a suitable solvent. The solvent used in the reaction may be selected from a wide variety of known solvents that dissolve hydroquinone or a salt thereof and the piperidine compound of Formula (3) or a salt thereof, and that does not adversely affect the reaction. Examples include halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride; lower alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol; ketone solvents such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone; ether solvents such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, and ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene, and xylene; ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and methyl acetate; acetonitrile; pyridine; 2,4,6-collidine; dimethyl sulfoxide; dimethylformamide; hexamethylphosphoric triamide; mixed solvents thereof; and the like.
The amount of hydroquinone or a salt thereof used is not particularly limited as long as the compound of Formula (1) or a salt thereof can be obtained. In terms of the yield, hydroquinone or a salt thereof is preferably used in an amount of 1.5 moles or more per mole of the piperidine compound of Formula (3) or a salt thereof.

Specifically, the reaction is preferably performed in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen gas or argon gas. Known methods can be used to perform the reaction in an inert atmosphere.
When the reaction mixture is returned to room temperature after completion of the reaction, adding a solvent can prevent the residual hydroquinone etc. to be completely solidified in a reaction vessel. This facilitates subsequent steps, such as purification. When the method using a solvent is used, crystals of the reaction product obtained thereafter can have an improved color. Even if the solvent used in this step does not dissolve the reaction mixture, as long as the reaction mixture can be formed into a slurry by adding the solvent and stirring, subsequent steps can be performed without any difficulty. The solvent is not particularly limited. Examples include diphenyl ether, ethyl acetate, n-octyl acetate, mixed solvents thereof, and the like. These solvents can be used as is, as a solvent for the salt formation described below.

The solvent used in recrystallization may be the same as the solvent used in salt formation.
The hydroquinone is an easily available compound. A commercially available product thereof can be used as is.
The salt of hydroquinone and the salt of 4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine, which may be reactants of the reaction, are preferably those obtained by adding an acid compound to hydroquinone or 4-(4-trifluoromethoxyphenoxy)piperidine and forming a salt.
