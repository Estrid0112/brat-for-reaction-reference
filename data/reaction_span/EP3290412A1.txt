FIELD OF THE INVENTION
AIDS is one of the most serious pandemic diseases of the modem era. Although current therapies based on targeting key processes of the HIV replication cycle are potent and selective, several clinical failures are recorded due to the emergence of drug resistance. Hence, there is an urgent need for novel drugs and alternative therapeutic strategies. Compounds of the present invention are novel anti-HIV agents targeting the HIV Nucleocapsid protein (NC), which is one of the most conserved sequences within HIV strains and is highly required for HIV replication, being therefore a primary target to overcome antiretroviral drug-resistance.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimated that at the end of 2010 there were approximately 34 million people infected by HIV and about 30 million people have died of AIDS-related causes since the beginning of the epidemic. During the last 25 years the arsenal of drugs to fight HIV infection has increased continuously. However, most of these drugs experienced clinical failure due to Drug Resistance (DR), i.e. the ability of HIV to mutate and overcome the effects of a given drug to prevent its replication. DR has been the most critical limitation in antiretroviral therapy since its advent, as substantiated by the World Health Organization in establishing the "global HIV drug resistance network". Although strategies to fight DR may span from the development of an effective vaccine to target host essential proteins for HIV replication, the most commonly and realistic adopted strategy is still the design of potent and selective inhibitors of target proteins. However, novel compounds developed as inhibitors of well-known HIV target proteins often lack full activity because of drug resistance. Thus, future anti-HIV drug research efforts should focus on new HIV targets. In this context it was developed an innovative strategy targeting a highly conserved and multi-functional protein such as the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NC), to prevent the emergence of DR and halting the virus life cycle at multiple steps. NC is a 55-aminoacid small basic protein with two zinc-fingers that assists the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) during reverse transcription by chaperoning the annealing of the cellular primer tRNA to the primer binding site (PBS) and the two obligatory DNA strand transfers necessary for the synthesis of a complete functional double-stranded vDNA with two long terminal repeats (see Mori M. et al, ACS Chemical Biology 2014, 9, 1950-1955). NC is also thought to protect the nascent vDNA agains nucleases (Krishnamoorthy G. et al, Nucleic Acids Res., 2003, 31, 5425-5432) and to assist the viral Integrase (IN) for the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (Poljak L. et al, J. Mol. Biol., 2003, 329, 411-421). As a domain of the Gag structural polyprotein precursor, NC selects the genomic RNA and promotes its dimerization and packaging during virus assembly. Finally, NC binding to RNA is critical for Gag processing by the viral protease enzymeand for the subsequent formation of the condensed ribonucleoprotein architecture within the virion (Mirambeau G. et al., 2007, PLoS One 2, e669). NC can hardly mutate, so that NC mutants are generally nonfunctional and result in noninfectious viruses. Therefore, specific inhibition of NC is thought to generate a sustained antiretroviral activity. Inhibition of NC has been achieved by different strategies leading to antiretroviral effects in vitro and in vivo (Mori M et al, Curr. Pharm. Des., 2011, 17, 3713-3728), although generally through unspecific mechanisms and thus causing significant cytotoxicity. Indeed, there is a critical deficiency of small molecule NC inhibitors (NCIs) endowed with a clear and safe mechanism of action as well as with antiviral activity in vitro, which may be developed as effective and safe antiretroviral agents.
WO 2012076822 describes peptide ligands for the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 that inhibit the replication of human immunodeficiency virus. Said peptide inhibitors were screened for their ability to inhibit destabilization of the cTAR hairpin by NCp7.
EP1087941 pertains to the discovery of a novel family of thiolesters and uses thereof. Also provided for are viricidal compounds and pharmaceutical formulations comprising these novel thiolesters. The invention also provides thiolester-inactivated viruses and thiolester-complexed viral proteins.
WO03014062 refers to certain thiol and acylthiol compounds capable to inhibit retrovirus growth by attacking the highly conserved zinc finger regions of essential viral proteins. These compounds, compositions containing them, and methods of using them to treat retroviral infections such as HIV are described. These compounds are also useful for preparation of vaccines comprised of inactivated retroviruses such as HIV, prevention of the transmission of such retroviruses, and detection of retroviral proteins.
WO 2005/121376 relates to novel Human Immunodeficiency Virus I (HIV-1) variants that are resistant against protease inhibitors including the high genetic barrier protease inhibitor R0033-4649 and show mutations not in the protease itself but in the viral Gag protein (Matrix and Capsid) and the viral cleavage sites thus establishing a novel resistance mechanism. The invention further relates to diagnostic assays for determining the presence in a sample of the HTV variant.
WO2004032869 provides methods and pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting viral replication, particularly retroviral replication. The methods comprise administration of stibonic acid or diphenyl compounds that disrupt viral nucleocapsid binding to nucleic acids. WO2011/156674 discloses inhibitors of retroviral growth that are useful in treatment of retroviral infections such as HIV. The compounds are thioaryl-derivatives targeting the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein (NCp7).
While several compounds have been proposed targeting NCp7, none have advanced through clinical trials due to toxicity or lack of specificity.
The problem solved by the invention is therefore the discovery of innovative antiretroviral compounds, in particular compounds that target the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein. WO2003035076 discloses 4,5-dihydroxypyrimidine-6-carboxamides as HIV-1 Integrase inhibitors. HIV-1 integrase catalyzes the insertion of the viral DNA into the genome of the host cell, which is an essential step in the viral replication cycle. Structure-activity relationship studies on this series of compounds are extensively reported in the literature (see for example Pace, P. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2007, Vol. 50, No. 9, 2225-2239) and elucidates structural determinants affecting the potency at HIV-1 integrase enzyme. In particular, it is evident that an aromatic ring separated by at least one sp3 atom at the amide in position 6 of the dihydroxypyrimidine core is essential for the activity. This pyrimidine series of compounds was further developed by Merck into the marketed drug Isentress™.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Within the present invention, it was surprisingly discovered that a specific series of compounds selected within the general formula claimed in WO2003035076 showed positive results in biological assays unveiling HIV-1 nucleocapsid inhibition properties, while more potent HIV integrase inhibitors, including Isentress™, in the same experimental settings were inactive. In particular, the combination of an aliphatic amide bearing a cyclo(hetero)alkyl substituent in position 6 and a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic ring in position 2 of the dihydroxypyrimidine contributes to the inhibition of HIV-1 nucleocapsid while unfavourable for HIV-integrase activity.
Based on the present results, the compounds of the invention are HIV-1 nucleocapsid inhibitors particularly useful for overcoming HIV-1 resistance to known classes of antiretroviral drugs, included viral strains resistant to HIV integrase inhibitors.
The present invention is directed toward the use of dihydroxy-pyrimidine derivatives targeting the HIV-1 NCp7 nucleocapsid protein as antiretroviral compounds for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in particular drug resistant HIV-1 infection.

The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compound of formula (I) or its derivatives as defined in the claims. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compound of formula (I) which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound of formula (I). Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in "Design of Prodrugs", ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.
A prodrug may be a pharmacologically inactive derivative of a biologically active substance (the "parent drug" or "parent molecule") that requires transformation within the body in order to release the active drug, and that has improved delivery properties over the parent drug molecule. The transformation in vivo may be, for example, as the result of some metabolic process, such as chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis of a carboxylic, phosphoric or sulphate ester, or reduction or oxidation of a susceptible functionality.
The present invention includes within its scope solvates of the compounds of formula (I) or (III) and salts thereof, for example, hydrates.
The compounds of the present invention may have asymmetric centers, chiral axes, and chiral planes (as described in: E.L. Eliel and S.H. Wilen, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1994, pages 1119-1190), and occur as racemates, racemic mixtures, and as individual diastereomers, with all possible isomers and mixtures thereof, including optical isomers, all such stereoisomers being included in the present invention. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may exist as tautomers and both tautomeric forms are intended to be encompassed by the scope of the invention, even though only one tautomeric structure is depicted.
The compounds may exist in different isomeric forms, all of which are encompassed by the present invention.
When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent, its definition on each occurrence is independent of every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.
It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the compounds of the instant invention can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be readily synthesized from readily available starting materials by techniques known in the art, as well as those methods set forth below. If a substituent is itself substituted with more than one group, it is understood that these multiple groups may be on the same carbon or on different carbons, so long as a stable structure results. The phrase "optionally substituted" should be taken to be equivalent to the phrase "unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents" and in such cases the preferred embodiment will have from zero to three substituents. More particularly, there are zero to two substituents. A substituent on a saturated, partially saturated or unsaturated heterocycle can be attached at any substitutable position.
As used herein, "alkyl" is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example,"C1-C6 alkyl" is defined to include groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 carbons in a linear or branched arrangement. For example, "C1-C6 alkyl" specifically includes methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, t-butyl, i-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and so on. The term "cycloalkyl" means a monocyclic, bicyclic or polycyclic saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, "C3-10cycloalkyl" includes cyclopropyl, methyl-cyclopropyl, 2,2-dimethyl-cyclobutyl, 2-ethyl-cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and so on.

Included in the instant invention is the free base of compounds of formula (I), as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts and stereoisomers thereof. Some of the specific compounds exemplified herein are the protonated salts of amine compounds. Compounds of formula (I) containing one or more N atoms may be protonated on any one, some or all of the N atoms. The term "free base" refers to the amine compounds in non-salt form. The encompassed pharmaceutically acceptable salts not only include the salts exemplified for the specific compounds described herein, but also all the typical pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the free form of compounds of formula (I). The free form of the specific salt compounds described may be isolated using techniques known in the art. For example, the free form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous NaOH, potassium carbonate, ammonia and sodium bicarbonate. The free forms may differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the acid and base salts are otherwise pharmaceutically equivalent to their respective free forms for purposes of the invention.
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the instant compounds can be synthesized from the compounds of this invention which contain a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, the salts of the basic compounds are prepared either by ion exchange chromatography or by reaction of the free base with stoichiometric amounts or with an excess of the desired salt-forming inorganic or organic acid in a suitable solvent or various combinations of solvents. Similarly, the salts of the acidic compounds are formed by reactions with the appropriate inorganic or organic base.
Thus, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include the conventional non-toxic salts of the compounds of this invention as formed by reaction of a basic instant compound with an inorganic or organic acid. For example, conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like, as well as salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxy-benzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, trifluoroacetic and the like. Preferably, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of this invention contains one equivalent of a compound of formula (I) and 1, 2 or 3 equivalent of an inorganic or organic acid. More particularly, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of this invention are the tartrate, trifluoroacetate or the chloride salts.
When the compound of the present invention is acidic, suitable "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared form pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases including inorganic bases and organic bases. Salts derived from inorganic bases include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium salts.

The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion where the active ingredient is dissolved in the oily phase. For example, the active ingredient may be first dissolved in a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin. The oil solution may be then introduced into a water and glycerol mixture and processed to form a microemulstion. The injectable solutions or microemulsions may be introduced into a patient's blood stream by local bolus injection.
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension for intramuscular and subcutaneous administration. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.
Compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions can be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials include cocoa butter, glycerinated gelatin, hydrogenated vegetable oils, mixtures of polyethylene glycols of various molecular weights and fatty acid esters of polyethylene glycol.
For topical use, creams, ointments, jellies, solutions or suspensions, etc., containing the compound of the invention are employed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemistry
a) General procedures.
The general synthetic strategy for the synthesis of the pyrimidine nucleus starts from the appropriate carbonitrile (A) which is converted to the corresponding amidoxime (B) that is condensed with dimethyl acetylene dicarboxylate. The adduct thus formed undergoes a thermally induced cyclisation to afford the desired 2-substituted dihydroxypyrimidine methyl ester analog (C). This key intermediate can be converted into the final compounds by methods well known in the art. Suitable methods for the synthesis of carboxamides or esters are described for example in Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistrym 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 19856, pp. 370-376.
The procedure outlined above and synthesized in the following Scheme 1 has been applied on multigram scale for the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention.<img> id-imgb0004.tif </img>
The compounds prepared within the instant invention are listed in Table 1.

General methods
Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were obtained from commercial sources and were used as received without further purification. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker spectrometers operating at (reported) frequencies between 400 and 600 MHz. Chemical shifts (δ) for signals corresponding to non-exchangeable protons (and exchangeable protons where visible) were recorded in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane and were measured using the residual solvent peak as reference. Signals are tabulated in the order: multiplicity (s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet; m, multiplet; b, broad, and combinations thereof); number of protons; costant(s) in hertz. UPLC-MS analysis was conducted on a Waters UPLC system with both Diode Array detection and Electrospray (+'ve and -'ve ion) MS detection. The stationary phase was a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 1.7um (2.1x50mm) column. The mobile phase comprised H2O containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and MeCN containing 0.1% formic acid (B) in the following linear gradients:Method A: 90% A (0.1 min), 90%-0% A (2.5 min), 0% A (0.3 min), 0-90% A (0.1 min) with a flow rate 0.5 mL/min.Method B: 95% A (0.5 min), 95%-50% A (1.9 min), 50-0% A (0.3 min), 0% (0.2 min), 0-100% A (0.1 min) with a flow rate 0.5 mL/min.

Biology
Compounds of the present invention could be tested for biological activity using the assay techniques below.
NC inhibition assay
The NC inhibition assay is based on the nucleic acid chaperone activity of the NC protein. NC destabilizes the secondary structure of cTAR DNA, the complementary sequence of the transactivation response element, which is involved in minus-strand DNA transfer during reverse transcription. In the assay, the cTAR sequence from the HIV-1 Mal strain (Bernacchi et al, J Mol Biol, 2002) is labeled with a dye (Alexa488 fluorophore) and a quencher 4-(4'-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoic acid (Dabcyl) at its 5' and 3' ends, respectively. In the absence of destabilization, the close proximity of both cTAR ends results in a strong fluorescence quenching of the dye emission by the Dabcyl group. NC(11-55) added to cTAR at a ratio of 10 NC/cTAR melts the bottom of the cTAR stem, which increases the distance between the dye and the quencher and as a result increases the dye fluorescence signal [Shvadchak et al, (2009) Identification by high throughput screening of small compounds inhibiting the nucleic acid destabilization activity of the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein. Biochimie, 916-923]. NCIs are expected to prevent the NC-induced destabilization of cTAR and thus reverse the NC-induced increase in the fluorescence of the labeled cTAR. The activity of the inhibitor is thus evaluated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensity observed in the presence of NC with the molecule to the one in the absence of the compound.
The doubly labelled cTAR DNA oligonucleotides (55nt) were synthesised and purified by IBA GmbH Nucleic Acids Product Supply (Göttingen, Germany). Extinction coefficient at 260 nm of 5.73 x 105 M-1 cm-1 was used to determine the concentration of cTAR.
The NC(11-55) peptide (Avilov et al, Antimicrob Agents Chemother, 2012) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis on a 433A synthesizer (ABI, Foster City, CA) as previously described [De Rocquigny H, (1991) First large scale chemical synthesis of the 72 amino acid HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein NCp7 in an active form. Biochem Biophys Res Commun., 1010-1018]. The peptide was stored lyophilized and was resuspended in water before use. The concentration of peptide was determined by using an extinction coefficient of 5.7 x 103 M-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. Next, 2.5 molar equivalents of ZnSO4 were added and pH was raised to its final value by adding buffer.
All experiments were performed at 20 °C in 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 30 mM NaCl, and 0.2 mM MgCl2. To evaluate the inhibition activity of compounds on NC-induced cTAR destabilization, cTAR DNA (0.1 µM) was preincubated with 1 µM NC(11-55) (molar ratio NC:cTAR = 10:1) for 15 min at room temperature before addition of compound. For single point screening, all compounds were tested at three final concentrations: 1 µM, 10 µM and 100 µM. For the IC50 determination, inhibition of NC-induced cTAR melting was monitored through addition of increasing concentrations of the selected molecules to the pre-formed NC(11-55)-cTAR complex. After the addition of compound, the mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature before the reading. The fluorescence signal was recorded with a plate reader Xenius (SAFAS Monaco) or Fluoromax 3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin-Yvon), and the excitation and emission wavelengths were 480 and 520 nm, respectively. The spectra were corrected for dilution, buffer fluorescence and screening effect (when it was required). In order to check the occurrence of aggregation, we performed additional reading of absorption with the plate reader Xenius (SAFAS Monaco) or Cary 4000 spectrophotometer (Agilent).
The percentage of inhibition (% inh) was calculated with the equation:<img> id-imgb0125.tif </img>%inh=IcTAR+NC−IcTAR+NC+InhIcTAR+NC−IcTAR*100, where IcTAR is the fluorescence intensity of labeled cTAR in the absence of NC(11-55), IcTAR+NC is the fluorescence intensity of labeled cTAR in the presence of NC(11-55), and IcTAR+NC+ Inh is fluorescence intensity of labeled cTAR in the presence of NC(11-55) and in the presence of compound.
To calculate the IC50 values, the experimental data were fitted in a logarithm scale using Origin software (Dose response fitting). Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. A compound showing >25% inhibition when tested at 100µM concentration is considered as "positive".
Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA) assay
The assay used a recombinant full length (1-55) HIV-1 NCp7 proteins based on the NL4-3 sequence (GenBank accession number AF324493). The protein was expressed and purified as described in [Carteau, S., Gorelick, R. J. & Bushman, F. D. Coupled integration of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 cDNA ends by purified integrase in vitro: stimulation by the viral nucleocapsid protein. Journal of virology 73, 6670-6679 (1999)].
Competition for single-stranded (ss) DNA binding was realized by mixing 1 µL of serial dilutions of NC inhibitors (diluted in DMSO) with 44 µL of NCp7 (300 nM) in a reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 2 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT). 5 µL of a 10 ng/µL (4 nM) solution of M13mp18 ssDNA (BayouBiolabs) were then added and the tubes were incubated for 25 minutes at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by chilling the tubes on ice followed by the addition of 5 µL of a loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.01% xylene cyanol, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4). Samples were then resolved on 25 cm-long, 1% (w/v) agarose gels (SeaKem LE Agarose, Lonza) in 0.5x TBE. Gels were run in a Sub-Cell GT cuvette (BioRad) for 18 h at room temperature at 3 V/cm, stained with SybrGold (Molecular Probes) and scanned for fluorescence using a Typhoon 8600 (GE Healthcare). The experiments were performed in triplicate. Competition efficiency was realized by measuring the relative distance in pixels between the unbound ssDNA control, the NCp7-bound ssDNA control and the bound ssDNA for each points of the titration with the ImageQuant software. The IC50 was estimated as the NC inhibitors concentrations for which the bound ssDNA migrated at 50% of the distance separating the bound from the unbound ssDNA.
A compound showing >25% inhibition when tested at 100µM concentration is considered as "positive".
MonoCycle/BiCycle assays
MonoCycle assay is a cell based assay allowing the evaluation of antiviral activity of HIV-1 inhibitors targeting the early steps of HIV-1 life cycle such as entry, uncoating of viral particles, reverse transcription and integration. The assay consists in the infection of TZM-bl cells (20,000/well) with the HIV-1 reference strain NL4-3 in presence of serial five-fold dilutions of the investigational inhibitors. After 48 hours, cells were lysed adding 40 µl of Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) to each well for 5 minutes, then 40 µl of Brighy-Glo Luciferase Reagent (Promega) were added to each well for relative luminescence units (RLU) counting using Glo-Max Multi Detection System (Promega). RLU values from each well were elaborated using the GraphPad v5.0 software to calculate the IC50 of each compound.
BiCycle Assay is cell based assay allowing the evaluation of the antiviral activity of HIV-1 inhibitors on the whole replication cycle of HIV-1. The assay consists in a first round of infection of the T-cell line MT-2 followed by infection of TZM-bl cells. MT-2 cells were seeded at a concentration of 50,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate and infected with the HIV-1 reference strain NL4-3 in presence of five-fold dilutions of the investigational compounds. After 72 hours, 50 µl of supernatant from each well, containing the virus produced in the first round of infection, were used to infect TZM-bl cells seeded in a 96-plate well at a concentration of 30,000 cells/well. Two days later, cells were lysed adding 40 µl of Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega) to each well for 5 minutes, then 40 µl of Brighy-Glo Luciferase Reagent (Promega) were added to each well for relative luminescence units (RLU) counting using Glo-Max Multi Detection System (Promega). RLU values from each well were elaborated using the GraphPad v5.0 software to calculate the IC50 of each compound.
Proliferation assay PBMC
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from healthy donors by separation over Ficoll-Hypaque (GEHealthear-Cat.# GEH17-1440-02) were suspended at 2x106 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 (Biowest-Cat.#L0501-500) supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated sterile fetal bovine serum (Gibco-Cat.#10270-106), 2 mmol/l L-glutamine (Biowest-Cat.#X0550-100), 50 U/mL Penicillin-50 µg/mL Streptomycin (Biowest-Cat.#L0022-100), referred to as complete medium (CM). PBMC were supplemented with 5 µg/mL of phytohaemagglutinin (Sigma Aldr-Cat.#L1668) and cultured in 75 cm2 flasks (Sarsted-Cat.#833.911.002) for 2 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.
PBMC were then washed in CM, counted by trypan blue exclusion (Gibco-Cat. #15250-061), centrifuged and suspended in fresh CM supplemented with 20 IU/mL recombinant human IL-2 (Miltenyi Biotec-Cat.#130-097-748) and seeded in a 96-well-tissue culture plate (Sarsted-Ca#831.837) at the density of 5x105 cells/mL (or 1x105 cells in 200 µL final CM volume per well). Cells were left untreated (negative control) or treated with different concentrations of the compounds.
After 7 days of incubation cytotoxicity was determined using Promega's CellTiter 96(R) AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (MTS assay) (Promega-Cat.#G3581) according to the manufacturer's instuctions. This is a colorimetric method for determining the number of viable cells in proliferation or cytotoxicity assays. The MTS tetrazolium compound is bioreduced by cells into a colored formazan product that is soluble in tissue culture medium. This conversion is presumably accomplished by NADPH or NADH produced by dehydrogenase enzymes in metabolically active cells.
Briefly, MTS solution was thawed at room temperature, or in a water bath at 37 °C and 40 µL of MTS solution was pipeted into each well of the 96-well assay plate containing the samples in 200 µL of culture medium and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 hours. The optical density was read at 490 nm using a 96-well plate reader (Tecan Infinite F50) and TD50 (toxic dose 50%, dose killing 50% of the cells compared to untreated control) value was calculated by interpolation of the curve obtained by plotting dose against percent mortality and by using "Magellan data analysis software". CM alone plus MTS solution was used as a blank, and cell culture well without compound was used as a cellular control.

HIV-integrase assay
The integrase assay was performed using the HIV-1 integrase assay kit (Xpress Bio Co, catalog number EZ-1700, Thurmont, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In this assay the streptavidin-coated 96-well plates were used and coated with a double stranded HIV-1 LTR U5 donor substrate (DS) DNA containing an end-labeled biotin. Full-length recombinant HIV-1 integrase protein was loaded onto the DS DNA substrate. After, the compounds were added in the concentration 5 - 1500 µM, and then a different double-stranded target substrate (TS) DNA containing a 3'-end modification was added to the reaction mixture. The HIV-1 integrase cleaved the terminal two bases from the exposed 3'-end of the HIV-1 LTR DS DNA and then catalyzed a strand-transfer recombination reaction to integrate the DS DNA into the TS DNA. The products of the reaction were detected colorimetrically using an HRP-labeled antibody directed against TS 3'-end modification. Isentress™ at 175 nM concentration was used as a positive control and showed ≥97% of inhibition in all experiments. The percentage of DMSO was fixed at 2.5% v/v in all samples. The absorbance at 450 nm was recorded with an iMark™ Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The absorbance values were corrected from the mean blank absorbance (reaction buffer negative control). To calculate the IC50 values, the experimental data were fitted in a logarithm scale using Origin software (Dose response fitting).
Three of the most active compounds (Compounds 26, 28, 60) were tested in the HIV-1 integration assay and the results are presented in Table 4.

The IC50 value of compound 26 is 100-fold higher in the IN assay as compared to the NC Inh assay, indicating a clear preference of this compound for the NC protein. In contrast, compounds 28 and 60 showed only a 3.8- and 2.9- fold increase in IN IC50 values in comparison to NC Inhibition IC50 values, suggesting that these compounds may target both IN and NC. Such a dual mechanism of action related to the targeting of the different effector mechanisms (i.e. IN and NC) is an highly promising approach as potentially avoids the pharmacokinetic disadvantages of using two separate agents with different absorption and distribution properties.
The antiviral activity of some of the compounds listed in Table 3 was further evaluated determining the IC50 with viruses carrying resistant mutations that reduce the susceptibility to drugs currently employed in clinical practice to treat HIV infection. The resistant viruses were obtained through the NIH AIDS Reagent Program (www.aidsreagent.org) and have been already characterized by the Phenosense Assay (Monogram Biosciences), considered as the reference assay for phenotypic investigation of HIV drug resistance due to its large application in clinical trials.
The features of HIV-1 resistant viral strains used considered in the analysis are reported below (Table 5).

Quantification of 2-LTR products
During the replication cycle of HIV, several forms of episomic HIV-DNA can be found in the nucleous as a result of abortive integration events in the genome of the cells. Unintegrated HIV-DNA forms such 2-LTR circles are considered as a marker of ongoing replication and can be easily detected and quantified through real time PCR systems. Moreover, several in vitro studies showed that integrase inhibitors like Raltegravir™ are responsible for the accumulation of 2-LTR circles in infected cells as a consequence of the block of HIV-DNA integration. Therefore, the quantification of 2-LTR circles can be used as an indirect method to test the blockade of the integration step by a candidate or licensed integrase inhibitors (Reigadas S. et al, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2010; 65: 434-437).
Evaluation of the potential activity of NCp7 inhibitors during the integration of HIV-DNA in the host genome
Since NCp7 partecipates to several steps of HIV replication including integration, it was developed a cell based assay aimed at the quantification of 2-LTR circles in infected cells cultured in presence of inhibitory concentrations of candidate NCp7 inhibitors. In each culture 3x10^6 MT-2 cells were infected with HIV-1 reference strain NL4-3 at M.O.I. 0.05 in presence of investigational NCp7 inhibitors 23, 31, 28. A culture with the HIV-1 Integrase inhibitor Raltegravir™ was prepared as a reference for the inhibition of integration, while an infected culture without drugs (named "no-drug") was used to compare the amount of 2-LTR in the different cultures. Table 7 indicates the concentration of drugs used in each culture in comparison to the values of EC50 (calculated through the BiCycle Assay) and the values of TD50.

Cultures were incubated at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 hours, then cells were harvested and total DNA was extracted using the "MagCore® Genomic DNA Whole Blood Kit" automated system (Diatech).
Around 500 ng of extracted DNA were used in separated real time PCR reactions specific for the quantification of the total genomic and HIV-1 DNA, and the HIV-DNA 2-LTR circles, respectively. Both values were normalized as copies/10^6 cells according to β-globin gene quantification included in the first method. For each culture a ratio between 2-LTR/ total HIV-DNA circles was calculated and compared to the ratio obtained with the "no-drug" culture. Results are shown in Table 8.

The results of the analysis shown in Table 8 indicated that the amounts of 2-LTR circles in all NCp7 treated cultures were similar those of the "no-drug" culture, while a three times higher titer of 2-LTR circles was measured in presence of Raltegravir™, as expected. These data supported the hypothesis that NCp7 inhibitors included in this analysis have no effect on viral integration.
