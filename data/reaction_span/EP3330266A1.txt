[Technical Field]
The present invention relates to a novel cyclopropane compound having a Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) antagonist activity and a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound, as well as a medicament possibly utilizable for the prophylaxis or treatment of a disease involving TRPA1.
[Background Art]
Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a non-selective cation channel belonging to the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channel superfamily. Like other TRP channel family, it has 6 transmembrane domains and forms a tetramer consisting of 4 subunits. TRPA1 is a ligand dependent ion channel, which changes structure by the binding of ligand. As a result, the channel opens to allow intracellular flow of cations such as calcium ion, sodium ion and the like, thereby controlling the membrane potential of the cells. As the TRPA1 ligand, stimulant natural substances (e.g., allylisothiocyanate (AITC), cinnamaldehyde and the like), environmental stimulants (e.g., formalin, acrolein and the like), endogenous substances (e.g., 4-hydroxynonenal and the like) and the like are known (non-patent documents 1 - 3). It is known that TRPA1 is also activated by cold stimulation, intracellular Ca2+ and the like (non-patent document 1). Many ligands such as AITC, cinnamaldehyde and the like form a covalent bond with the cysteine residue and the lysine residue at the N-terminal in the cytoplasm, and activate the channel (non-patent document 2). In addition, intracellular Ca2+ is considered to bind to the N-terminal EF hand domain and opens the channel (non-patent document 4). TRPA1 has been reported to be highly expressed in the sensory nerves such as spinal cord nerve, vagus nerve, trigeminal nerve and the like. TRPA1 has been reported to be co-expressed with perception·pain-related markers such as TRPV1, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP), substance P and the like (non-patent documents 5 - 7). Therefore, it is considered that, once TRPA1 present in the sensory nerve is activated by various stimulations, channel opening and depolarization of the cellular membrane occur, neuropeptides (CGRP, substance P) are liberated from the nerve ending, and perception such as nociception and the like is transmitted.
In fact, it has been reported that TRPA1 gene knockdown by the gene specific antisense method improves hyperalgesia induced by inflammation and nerve damage in pain model (non-patent document 8). Also, it has been reported that a pain behavior induced by formalin disappears in TRPA1 gene knockout mouse (non-patent document 9). From the above, TRPA1 is considered to play an important role in the nociceptive transmission. There are reports suggesting that TRPA1 is involved in migraine and diabetic neuropathy (non-patent documents 10, 11), and it is expected as a treatment target in pain-associated diseases such as nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain and the like.
Also, TRPA1 is known to show high expression in the afferent sensory nerve projected on the gastrointestinal tract such as esophagus, stomach, large intestine and the like. It has been reported that TRPA1 knockdown decreases nociceptive reaction due to extension of stomach (non-patent document 12), and large intestine hyperalgesia induced by AITC and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) is normalized in TRPA1 gene knockout mouse (non-patent document 13). From the above, TRPA1 is suggested to play an important role in the perception· nociception transmission in the gastrointestinal tract, and is expected to be effective for the treatment of digestive tract diseases such as functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, erosive esophagitis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), pancreatitis and the like (non-patent document 14).
Furthermore, TRPA1 plays a key role in the detection of a noxious substance in the trachea. It has been reported that TRPA1 gene knockout suppresses inflammation of the trachea in OVA model (non-patent document 15). Therefore, antagonism of TRPA1 is considered to be also useful for pulmonary diseases such as asthma, chronic coughing, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the like.
As other diseases involving TRPA1, dermatic diseases such as pruritus, allergic dermatitis including atopic dermatitis, burn and the like (non-patent documents 16 - 19), inflammatory diseases such as burn, osteoarthritis and the like (non-patent document 20), bladder diseases such as overactive bladder·abnormal urination·cystitis and the like (non-patent document 21), neurological diseases such as anticancer agent-induced neuropathy and the like (non-patent documents 22 - 24) and the like are known. Thus, a compound capable of functional regulation of TRPA1 is industrially and therapeutically useful in many aspects. In particular, a compound that antagonizes TRPA1 is highly expected as a new therapeutic drug for pain diseases, digestive tract diseases, lung diseases, dermatic diseases, inflammatory diseases, bladder diseases and neurological diseases in human.
As the TRPA1 antagonist, the following compounds described in patent documents 1 - 7 have been reported.wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 1wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 2wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 3wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 4wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 5wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 6wherein the definition of each symbol is as described in patent document 7
However, these compounds are structurally different from the compound of the present invention represented by the formula (I) described below. To be specific, the compound described in patent document 2 does not have a cyclopropane ring on a carbon atom adjacent to a sulfoneamide bond essential for the compound of the present invention, the compounds described in patent documents 3 and 6 do not have a benzofuran skeleton bonded to a sulfonyl group essential for the compound of the present invention, and the compounds described in patent documents 1, 4, 5 and 7 do not have a cyclopropane ring as well as a benzofuran skeleton. All of them are structurally different from the compound of the present invention.

The obtained double stranded DNA was enzyme-digested with HindIII and XbaI, and introduced into a multicloning site of expression plasmid pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) (manufactured by Invitrogen) to give a human TRPA1 expression plasmid.
Cell preparation
Human embryonic kidney-derived 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 unit penicillin, and 10 µg streptomycin. One day before assay, 3×106 of 293T cells were plated on a petri dish having a diameter of 10 cm, and cultured in a CO2 incubator for 24 hr. OPTI-MEM I Reduced Serum Media (Invitrogen) (600 µL), Mirus TransIT-293 (Mirus Bio) (18 µL), and human TRPA1 expression plasmid (6 µg) were mixed, the total amount of the mixture was added to the cells on the petri dish to allow for gene transfer. The cells were recovered about for 8 hr later, plated on a poly-D-lysine coated 384 well black/clear bottom plate at 12,000 cells/well, and cultured overnight.
Measurement of intracellular calcium increase
The medium was removed from the 384 well plate, calcium indicator (Molecular Device, trade name: FLIPR Calcium4 Assay Kit) dissolved in HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (pH 7.2) containing 20 mM HEPES was added (38 µL/well), and the cells were stained in a CO2 incubator for 1 hr. The 384 well plate was stood at room temperature for not less than 15 min, set on FDSS7000 (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.), and a test substance solution was added at 10 µL/well. After 10 min, allylisothiocyanate solution (12 µL/well) was added, the relative fluorescence intensity was measured for 5 min after addition of the allylisothiocyanate solution.
Preparation of test substance solution and allylisothiocyanate solution
A test substance solution was prepared to have a composition of HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (pH 7.2) containing 0.48% dimethyl sulfoxide, a test substance at 4.8-fold concentration of the evaluation concentration, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mM HEPES. An allylisothiocyanate solution was prepared to have a composition of HBSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, 100 µM allylisothiocyanate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mM HEPES.
Calculation of antagonist activity
The activity rate of a test substance at each concentration was calculated, wherein the relative fluorescence intensity change of a well free of a test substance and containing allylisothiocyanate is 100% activity rate, and the relative fluorescence intensity change of a well free of a test substance and allylisothiocyanate is 0% activity rate. The inhibitory rate of a test substance at each concentration was calculated by subtracting the activity rate of the test substance from 100% activity rate, and the concentration of a test substance showing 50% inhibitory rate was calculated as IC50 from the sigmoid approximate curve by XLFit (idbs).
The results are shown in Table 8. The activity values of Examples are shown in Table 8-1 and, for reference, the activity values of Comparative Examples are shown in Table 8-2. As shown therein, the compound of the present invention showed a superior TRPA1 antagonist activity.

Experimental Example 2: AITC-induced pain behavior evaluation test
To evaluate the effectiveness of the test substance in vivo, allylisothiocyanate (AITC)-induced pain behavior evaluation test was performed using mice.
AITC is a selective agonist of the TRPA1 channel, and causes a pain behavior by TRPA1 activation when administered to animal. Therefore, the intensity of the TRPA1 antagonist action of the test substance in the living body can be evaluated by measuring the pain behavior after AITC administration.
1. Administration of test substance to animal
As the animal, male ICR mice (6- to 8-week-old) are used. The mice are fasted on the previous day of the test. The test substance is intraperitoneally or orally administered for evaluation. In the case of intraperitoneal administration, the substance is administered 30 min before the AITC administration. In the case of oral administration, the substance is administered 60 min before the AITC administration.
2. AITC-induced pain behavior evaluation
AITC (0.1%) is subcutaneously administered to the sole of the left leg of mouse, and the time when the mouse shows a behavior of licking the sole of the leg (Licking time) in 5 min immediately after the AITC administration is measured.
3. Calculation of inhibitory rate
The licking time of the vehicle administration group in each test is taken as 100%, and the activity rate by administration of each test substance (Licking time of test substance administration/Licking time of vehicle administration group x 100) is determined, and the numerical value obtained by subtracting the activity rate from 100 is calculated as an inhibitory rate.
By the above-mentioned method, it can be confirmed that the compound of the present invention has a superior TRPA1 antagonist activity, is superior pharmacokinetics, and shows superior efficacy in animal model.
The above-mentioned evaluation tests confirm the effectiveness of the compound of the present invention.
