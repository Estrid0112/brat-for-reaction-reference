TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a compound including a polymerizable group, a polymerizable composition and a polymerizable liquid crystal composition that include the compound, and an optically anisotropic body produced using the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.
BACKGROUND ART
Compounds including a polymerizable group (polymerizable compounds) have been used for producing various optical materials. For example, a polymer having a uniform orientation can be prepared by polymerizing a polymerizable composition including a polymerizable compound which has been arranged in a pattern while being in a liquid crystal state. Such a polymer can be used for producing polarizing plates, phase-retardation plates, and the like, which are necessary in the production of displays. The polymerizable composition typically includes two or more polymerizable compounds in order to meet the demands for optical properties, polymerization velocity, solubility, melting point, glass transition temperature, and the transparency, mechanical strength, surface hardness, heat resistance, and lightfastness of the polymer. The polymerizable compounds included in the polymerizable composition are required to enhance physical properties of the polymerizable composition without degrading the other properties of the polymerizable composition.
There has been a demand for phase-retardation films having a small or reverse wavelength dispersion of birefringence in order to increase the viewing angles of liquid crystal displays. Accordingly, various polymerizable liquid crystal compounds having a reverse- or small-wavelength dispersion have been developed as a material for such phase-retardation films. However, when the polymerizable compounds are added to a polymerizable composition, the polymerizable compounds cause crystals to precipitate, that is, the polymerizable compounds degrade the preservation stability of the polymerizable composition (PTL 3). Furthermore, when the polymerizable composition is applied to a base material and polymerization is subsequently performed, inconsistencies are likely to be formed in the resulting film (PTL 1 to PTL 3). If the film having inconsistencies is used as a material for, for example, displays, nonuniformity in the brightness of the screen and unnatural colors may occur. This significantly degrades the quality of displays. Consequently, the development of a polymerizable liquid crystal compound having a reverse- or small-wavelength dispersion, with which the above issues may be addressed, has been anticipated.

The polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention may include a polymerizable compound that does not have a liquid crystal property in an amount such that the liquid crystal property of the composition is not impaired significantly. Specifically, any compound known in the related art as a polymer-forming monomer or a polymer-forming oligomer may be used. Specific examples of such a compound include the compounds described in “Hikari Kouka Gijutsu Databook, Zairyou-hen (“Photocuring Technology Databook, Material Section”) (monomer, oligomer, photopolymerization initiator)” (supervised by Kunihiro Ichimura and Kiyomi Kato, edited by Technonet).
While the compound according to the present invention can be polymerized without using a photopolymerization initiator, a photopolymerization initiator may be used depending on the purpose. In such a case, the concentration of the photopolymerization initiator in the compound according to the present invention is preferably 0.1% to 15% by mass, is more preferably 0.2% to 10% by mass, and is further preferably 0.4% to 8% by mass.

A polymer produced by polymerizing a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention may be used in various applications. For example, a polymer produced by polymerizing a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention that has not been aligned may be used for producing a light-scattering plate, a depolarization plate, or a moiré fringe-prevention plate. On the other hand, a polymer produced by polymerizing a polymerizable liquid crystal composition that has been aligned advantageously has an optical anisotropy. Such an optically anisotropic body can be produced by, for example, depositing a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention on a substrate rubbed with a cloth or the like, a substrate provided with an organic thin film formed thereon, or a substrate provided with an alignment film formed thereon by the oblique deposition of SiO2 or interposing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition between substrates and polymerizing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.
Examples of a method for depositing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition on a substrate include spin coating, die coating, extrusion coating, roll coating, wire bar coating, gravure coating, spray coating, dipping, and printing. When coating is employed, an organic solvent may be added to the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. Examples of the organic solvent include a hydrocarbon solvent, a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent, an ether solvent, an alcohol solvent, a ketone solvent, an ester solvent, and aprotic solvent. Examples of the hydrocarbon solvent include toluene and hexane. Examples of the halogenated hydrocarbon solvent include methylene chloride. Examples of the ether solvent include tetrahydrofuran, acetoxy-2-ethoxyethane, and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate. Examples of the alcohol solvent include methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. Examples of the ketone solvent include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, γ-butyrolactone, and N-methylpyrrolidones. Examples of the ester solvent include ethyl acetate and cellosolve. Examples of the aprotic solvent include dimethylformamide and acetonitrile. The above solvents may be used alone or in combination and selected appropriately with consideration of vapor pressure and solubility in the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. The organic solvent added to the polymerizable liquid crystal composition can be volatilized by air drying, heat drying, vacuum drying, or vacuum heat drying. It is possible to effectively increase ease of applying the polymerizable liquid crystal material to a substrate by forming an intermediate layer, such as a polyimide thin-film, on the substrate or by adding a leveling agent to the polymerizable liquid crystal material. Forming an intermediate layer, such as a polyimide thin-film, on a substrate effectively enhances the adhesion of a polymer produced by polymerizing the polymerizable liquid crystal material to the substrate.
Examples of an alignment treatment which are other than those described above include an alignment treatment in which the flow orientation of the liquid crystal material is used and an alignment treatment in which an electric field or a magnetic field is used. The above alignment methods may be used alone or in combination. A photo alignment method may also be used as an alignment method instead of rubbing. The shape of the substrate is not limited to planar; the substrate may include a portion having a curved surface. The substrate may be composed of an organic material or an inorganic material. Examples of the organic materials that can be used as a material for the substrate include polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyamide, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyarylate, polysulfone, triacetylcellulose, cellulose, and polyether ether ketone. Examples of the inorganic materials that can be used as a material for the substrate include silicon, glass, and calcite.
The polymerization of a polymerizable liquid crystal composition including the compound according to the present invention is preferably performed by irradiating the polymerizable liquid crystal composition with an active energy ray, such as ultraviolet radiation or an electron beam, in order to perform polymerization in a short time. In the case where ultraviolet radiation is used, either of a polarized light source and an unpolarized light source may be used. In the case where the polymerization of the liquid crystal composition is performed while the liquid crystal composition is interposed between two substrates, at least one of the substrates which is irradiated with the active energy ray needs to be adequately permeable to the active energy ray. After a specific portion of the liquid crystal composition has been polymerized by using a mask when the liquid crystal composition is irradiated with the light, the conditions such as an electric field, a magnetic field, or a temperature may be changed in order to change the orientation of the other portion of the liquid crystal composition that has not yet been polymerized. In such a case, the other portion of the liquid crystal composition is subsequently polymerized by being irradiated with the active energy ray. The temperature at which the liquid crystal composition is irradiated with the active energy ray is preferably within the temperature range in which the polymerizable liquid crystal composition according to the present invention is present in a liquid crystal state. In particular, in the case where an optically anisotropic body is produced using photopolymerization, polymerization is preferably performed at a temperature closer to room temperature, that is, typically, 25° C., in order not to induce unintended thermal polymerization. The intensity of the active energy ray is preferably 0.1 mW/cm2 to 2 W/cm2. If the intensity of the active energy ray is 0.1 mW/cm2 or less, a large amount of time may be required for the completion of photopolymerization, which degrades productivity. If the intensity of the active energy ray is 2 W/cm2 or more, the polymerizable liquid crystal compound or the polymerizable liquid crystal composition may be degraded.
The optically anisotropic body produced by polymerizing the composition may be subjected to a heat treatment in order to reduce initial changes in the properties of the optically anisotropic body and increase the consistency in the properties of the optically anisotropic body. The temperature at which the heat treatment is performed is preferably 50° C. to 250° C. The amount of time during which the heat treatment is performed is preferably 30 seconds to 12 hours.
The optically anisotropic body produced by the above-described method may be used alone after being removed from the substrate. Alternatively, the optically anisotropic body may also be used without being removed from the substrate. A multilayer structure constituted by the optically anisotropic bodies may also be used. The optically anisotropic body may be bonded to another substrate.
