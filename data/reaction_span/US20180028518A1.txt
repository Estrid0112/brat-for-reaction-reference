TECHNICAL FIELD
This disclosure relates generally to therapeutics for treatment of liver fibrosis, elevated cholesterol levels, and insulin resistance.
BACKGROUND
Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are major transcription factors regulating the biosynthesis of cholesterol, fatty acid, and triglyceride. They control the expression of crucial genes involved in lipogenesis and uptake. Inhibition of the SREBP pathway can reduce lipid biosynthesis and thus can be a strategy to treat metabolic diseases, such as type II diabetes, insulin resistance, fatty liver and atherosclerosis [Xiao, et al. Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin (2013) 45:1, pp 2-10]. In mammals, three SREBP isoforms are known, designated SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2. SREBP-1a controls a broad range of SREBP targets including production of fatty acids, triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol. SREBP-1c preferentially activates genes of fatty acid and triglyceride metabolism, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes of cholesterol metabolism, both of which have been studied in human and mice models [Horton, et al. J. Clin. Invest. (2002) 109:9, pp 1125-1131], as well as Drosophila [Rawson. Nature Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. (2003) 4:8, pp 631-640].
Recent studies have also presented a link between upregulation of lipid synthesis and prostate cancer [Suburu, et al. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. (2012) 98:0, pp 1-10]. The metabolic shift from catabolic to anabolic metabolism is a hallmark of cancer cells. Many cancers require synthesis of fatty acids, and other lipids such as cholesterol and androgens are implicated in prostate cancer. SREP-1c is the major transcriptional regulator of enzymes in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, and its expression can be stimulated by androgens and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in prostate cancer cells. Overexpression of SREP-1c is sufficient to cause tumorigenicity and invasion of prostate cancer cells. SREBP-1 can also increase expression of NOXS, a prominent producer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and regulator of prostate cancer cell growth [Brar, et al. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. (2003) 285:2, pp C353-369; Huang, et al. Mol. Cancer Res. (2012) 10:1, pp 133-142; Huang, et al. Cancer Research (2012) 72:8, SUPPL. 1; Huang, et al. Mol. Cancer Res. (2014) 13:4, pp 855-866].
SREBP-2, a regulator of androgen synthesis, is also itself regulated by androgens, demonstrating a direct feedback circuit for regulation of androgen production. SREBP-2 expression increases during disease progression and is significantly higher after castration. This transcription factor also lacks its feedback inhibition in prostate cancer cells, implicating a role for cholesterol and androgen synthesis in prostate cancer [Eberle, et al. Biochimie (2004) 86:11, pp 839-848; Ettinger, et al. Cancer Res. (2004), 64:6, pp 2212-2221; Chen, et al. Int. J. Cancer (2001), 91:1, pp 41-45].
Blocking SREBP functions linked to disease states therefore represents an important therapeutic approach for limiting lipid/cholesterol synthesis in membrane production which occurs in metabolic diseases and in cancer progression, as well as in viral pathogenesis [Naar, et al. Clin. Lipidol. (2012) 7:1, pp 27-36]. Small molecule therapeutics affecting metabolic regulators such as mTOR, AMPK or SIRT1, including Rapamycin, Metformin, or Resveratrol, respectively, may impinge on the transcriptional activity of SREBPs. Recently, two non-sterol small molecules, fatostatin and betulin have been found to inhibit SREBP processing [Kamisuki, et al. Chem. Biol. (2009) 16:8, pp 882-892; Tang, et al. Cell. Metab. (2011) 13:1, pp 44-56]. Methods for the treatment of cancers having a p53 mutation, such as breast cancer cells, using SREBP inhibitors have been presented [Freed-Pastor, et al. PCT. Publication WO2013-110007A1].
Fatostatin analogs have recently been described as potential therapeutics for the treatment of metabolic disorders [Uesugi, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 8,207,196]. Key compounds presented therein are based around Formula X:

(2011) 54:13, pp 4923-4927].

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Definitions
For use herein, unless clearly indicated otherwise, use of the terms “a,” “an,” and the like refers to one or more.
As used herein, reference to “about” a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to “about X” includes description of “X.”
“Alkyl” refers to and includes saturated linear or branched univalent hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof. Particular alkyl groups are those having 1 to 6 carbon atoms (a “C1-C6 alkyl”). When an alkyl residue having a specific number of carbons is named, all geometric isomers having that number of carbons are intended to be encompassed and described; thus, for example, “butyl” is meant to include n-butyl, sec-butyl, iso-butyl, and tert-butyl; “propyl” includes n-propyl and iso-propyl. This term is exemplified by groups such as methyl, t-butyl, n-heptyl, octyl, and the like.
“Alkenyl” refers to an unsaturated hydrocarbon group having at least one site of olefinic unsaturation (i.e., having at least one moiety of the formula C═C) and preferably having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples of alkenyl include but are not limited to ethenyl, -CH═CH2, -CH2-CH═CH-CH3 and -CH═CH-CH═CH2.

Examples of alkynyl include but are not limited to ethynyl, “-C≡CH,” -CH2-C≡C-CH3 and -C≡C-C≡CH.
“Cycloalkyl” refers to and includes cyclic univalent hydrocarbon structures. Cycloalkyl can consist of one ring, such as cyclohexyl, or multiple rings, such as adamantyl. A cycloalkyl comprising more than one ring may be fused, spiro or bridged, or combinations thereof. A preferred cycloalkyl is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon having from 3 to 13 annular carbon atoms. A more preferred cycloalkyl is a saturated cyclic hydrocarbon having from 3 to 6 annular carbon atoms (a “C3-C6 cycloalkyl”). Examples of cycloalkyl groups include adamantyl, decahydronaphthalenyl, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and the like.
“Cycloalkenyl” refers to an unsaturated hydrocarbon group within a cycloalkyl having at least one site of olefinic unsaturation (i.e., having at least one moiety of the formula C═C). Cycloalkenyl can consist of one ring, such as cyclohexyl, or multiple rings, such as norbornenyl. A more preferred cycloalkenyl is an unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbon having from 3 to 8 annular carbon atoms (a “C3-C8 cycloalkenyl”). Examples of cycloalkenyl groups include cyclopropenyl, cyclobutenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, and the like.
“Heterocycle,” “heterocyclic,” or “heterocyclyl” refers to a saturated or an unsaturated non-aromatic group having a single ring or multiple condensed rings, and having from 1 to 10 annular carbon atoms and from 1 to 4 annular heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen, and the like. A heterocycle comprising more than one ring may be fused, spiro or bridged, or any combination thereof. In fused ring systems, one or more of the rings can be aryl or heteroaryl. A heterocycle having more than one ring where at least one ring is aromatic may be connected to the parent structure at either a non-aromatic ring position or at an aromatic ring position. In one variation, a heterocycle having more than one ring where at least one ring is aromatic is connected to the parent structure at a non-aromatic ring position.
“Aryl” as used herein refers to an unsaturated aromatic carbocyclic group having a single ring (e.g., phenyl) or multiple condensed rings (e.g., naphthyl or anthryl) which condensed rings mayor may not be aromatic. The aryl group may be optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents described herein. Particular aryl groups are those having from 6 to 14 annular (i.e., ring) carbon atoms (a “C6-C14 aryl”). An aryl group having more than one ring where at least one ring is non-aromatic may be connected to the parent structure at either an aromatic ring position or at a non-aromatic ring position. In one variation, an aryl group having more than one ring where at least one ring is non-aromatic is connected to the parent structure at an aromatic ring position.
“Heteroaryl” as used herein refers to an unsaturated aromatic cyclic group having from 1 to 14 annular (i.e., ring) carbon atoms and at least one annular heteroatom, including but not limited to heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. A heteroaryl group may have a single ring (e.g., pyridyl, furyl) or multiple condensed rings (e.g., indolizinyl, benzothienyl) which condensed rings mayor may not be aromatic. The heteroaryl group may be optionally substituted independently with one or more substituents described herein. Particular heteroaryl groups are 5-to 14-membered rings having 1 to 12 annular (i.e., ring) carbon atoms and 1 to 6 annular (i.e., ring) heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur; 5-to 10-membered rings having 1 to 8 annular carbon atoms and 1 to 4 annular heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur; and 5-6-or 7-membered rings having 1 to 5 annular carbon atoms and 1 to 4 annular heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. In one variation, heteroaryl includes monocyclic aromatic 5-, 6-or 7-membered rings having from 1 to 6 annular carbon atoms and 1 to 4 annular heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. In another variation, heteroaryl includes polycyclic aromatic rings having from 1 to 12 annular carbon atoms and 1 to 6 annular heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur. A heteroaryl group having more than one ring where at least one ring is non-aromatic may be connected to the parent structure at either an aromatic ring position or at a non-aromatic ring position. In one variation, a heteroaryl group having more than one ring where at least one ring is non-aromatic is connected to the parent structure at an aromatic ring position.

“Halogen” refers to elements of the Group 17 series having atomic number 9 to 85. Preferred halo groups include the radicals of fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. Where a residue is substituted with more than one halogen, it may be referred to by using a prefix corresponding to the number of halogen moieties attached, e.g., dihaloaryl, dihaloalkyl, trihaloaryl etc. refer to aryl and alkyl substituted with two (“di”) or three (“tri”) halo groups, which may be but are not necessarily the same halogen; thus 4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl is within the scope of dihaloaryl. An alkyl group in which each H is replaced with a halo group is referred to as a “perhaloalkyl.” An alkenyl group in which each H is replaced with a halo group is referred to as a “perhaloalkenyl.” An alkynyl group in which each H is replaced with a halo group is referred to as a “perhaloalkynyl.” A preferred perhaloalkyl group is trifluoroalkyl (-CF3). Similarly, “perhaloalkoxy” refers to an alkoxy group in which a halogen takes the place of each H in the hydrocarbon making up the alkyl moiety of the alkoxy group. An example of a perhaloalkoxy group is trifluoromethoxy (-OCF3).
Any and all stereoisomers, including geometric isomers (cis/trans or E/Z isomers), tautomers, salts, N-oxides, and solvates of the compounds described herein can be used in the disclosed methods. This disclosure also provides methods of making such compounds.

In some embodiments, the compound is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, or 152.
In some embodiments, the compound is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 37, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, or 94.
Representative examples of compounds detailed herein, including intermediates and final compounds, are depicted in Table 1 and elsewhere herein. It is understood that in one aspect, any of the compounds may be used in the methods detailed herein, including, where applicable, intermediate compounds that may be isolated and administered to an individual.
The compounds depicted herein may be present as salts even if salts are not depicted, and it is understood that the compositions and methods provided herein embrace all salts and solvates of the compounds depicted here, as well as the non-salt and non-solvate form of the compound, as is well understood by the skilled artisan. In some embodiments, the salts of the compounds provided herein are pharmaceutically acceptable salts.
In one embodiment, the compound is a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of Formulae (Ia), (Ib), (IIa) or (IIb), or any variation presented herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.
In some embodiments, certain compounds presented herein are considered to be “prodrug” forms of other compounds herein. Prodrugs are precursor derivatives that, upon administration to a patient, undergo metabolism in-vivo such as, for example, hydrolysis to release the active form of the compound-the ‘parent’ compound. The prodrug form itself is either inactive or less active than the parent. Prodrugs are designed to improve bioavailability or to improve selective administration to particular organs, such as the liver [see, for example, Erion, et al. PNAS (2007) 104:39, pp 15490-15495; Erion, et al. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. (2005) 312:2, pp 554-560; Meyer, et al. Patent Publication US 2006-0281695A1]. Compounds provided herein such as, for example, compound nos. 106-111 can be considered prodrug forms of the ‘parent’ compound no. 5. In some embodiments, prodrug forms of compounds presented herein are provided. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in “Design of Prodrugs”, ” ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985; Beaumont; K. et al. Curr. Drug Metab. (2003) 4, pp 461-485; Mizen, L, et al. Pharm. Biotechnol. (1998) 11, pp 345-365. In addition to prodrugs, this disclosure provides the salts, esters, amides, and other protected or derivatized forms of the described compounds.
As has been described above, the inherent pKa(s) of molecules can be assessed by potentiometric methods known to the skilled artisan, typically UV spectrophotometry [see, for example, Julémont, et al. J. Med. Chem. (2002), 45, pp 5182-5185]. In-silico methods can be used as a predictive tool, and software is commercially available from, for example, ACD/Labs, Molecular Discovery, ChemAxon, and other vendors. Without being bound by theory, it is presented that compounds provided herein possess unexpected physicochemical properties presumed to arise from the presence of the trifluoromethylsulfonamide moiety and its effect on the acidity of the remaining structure of the provided compounds as a whole. The compounds provided herein contain several ionizable centers including, for example, the trifluoromethylsulfonamide nitrogen atom; the thiazole ring nitrogen atom; the “ring A” pyridine nitrogen atom, etc.
As one example to describe the theory, compound #37 could exist in the following forms:
<img> id-US20180028518A1-20180201-C00214.TIF </img>
Other ionized forms are conceivable, but those presented here are a protonated form; a neutral or internal zwitterionic form; and an anionic form. Which form would exist is dependent upon the pH of the aqueous or physiological solution in which the compound is placed. Calculated pKa values of compound #37 [provided by I-Lab 2.0 (ACD/Labs, Inc.)] give two values of 3.4 and 5.4. These values are similar to those experimentally obtained under potentiometric and spectrophotometric methods [courtesy of Pion, Inc.], found to be 3.09 and 5.27. When the CF3 group is replaced by a CH3 group, the calculated pKa values become 5.1 and 7.5-both notably higher. It is postulated that the more electronegative nature of the CF3 group results in a more highly acidic nature of the compound. Based on the calculated/measured pKa values of the trifluoromethylsulfonamide containing compounds claimed herein, it is likely that at a pH of 6-8, these compounds will predominantly exist in the anionic form, with the above equilibrium lying to the right at higher pH values. The anionic form renders the compound more aqueous soluble and therefore better absorbed. A solubility study [courtesy of Pion, Inc.] showed average solubilities of 13 μg/mL @ pH 6.0, 104 μg/mL @ pH 7.0, and >130 μg/mL @ pH 8.0. When a compound is dosed orally, most of the absorption occurs in the intestines where the pH ranges from 6-8. Therefore it is likely that the trifluoromethylsulfonamide containing compounds claimed herein will have significantly better solubility and absorption when dose orally relative to the methylsulfonamides which the anionic form would be present to a significantly lower extent at pH 6-8, compared to its neutral/zwitterionic form).
Examples of perhaloalkylsulfonamide groups are presented hereinabove. In some embodiments, also provided are compounds bearing perhaloalkenylsulfonamide groups, perhaloalkynylsulfonamide groups, or alkylsulfonamide groups bearing 1 or more halogen atoms. Such compounds can include, for example, the following:
<img> id-US20180028518A1-20180201-C00215.TIF </img>
Without being bound by theory, it is expected that each of these particular groups, and variations therein, has varying degrees of electronegativity, affording subtle changes in pKa, and allowing a tuning of the acidity of the disclosed compounds, where required by the skilled artisan.
Pharmaceutically Acceptable Salts
“Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth metal ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Further examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include those listed in Berge et al., Pharmaceutical Salts, J. Pharm. Sci. 1977 Jan; 66(1):1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound disclosed herein in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. In one embodiment, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt includes the solvent addition forms or crystal forms thereof, particularly solvates or polymorphs. Solvates contain either stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amounts of a solvent, and are often formed during the process of crystallization. Hydrates are formed when the solvent is water, or alcoholates are formed when the solvent is alcohol. Polymorphs include the different crystal packing arrangements of the same elemental composition of a compound. Polymorphs usually have different X-ray diffraction patterns, infrared spectra, melting points, density, hardness, crystal shape, optical and electrical properties, stability, and solubility. Various factors such as the recrystallization solvent, rate of crystallization, and storage temperature may cause a single crystal form to dominate.

Effect of Compounds on SREBP2 Cleavage and Cell Viability in HepG2 Cells.
Cancer cells such as HepG2 cells depend on SREBP activation and de novo lipogenesis to survive, particularly in low serum or serum-free conditions. Using this model, compounds were screened over 24 hours for the ability to block cleavage of SREBP to its active form and over 72 hours for an effect on cell viability under serum-free conditions.
Average SREBP2 cleavage in HepG2 cells was measured in the presence of compounds disclosed in Table 1. HepG2 cells were seeded at 500,000 cells per well in 6-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 2 days, cells were treated with compounds (20 μM) for 1 day in DMEM without FBS. Western blots were normalized with respect to actin.
For viability measurements, HepG2 cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. After 1 day in culture, cells were treated with compounds (20 μM & 5 μM) for 3 days in DMEM without FBS. Viability was measured by MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide). Treatment with compounds (20 μM & 5 μM) was carried out in medium without FBS, and viability was measured by MTS.
The results are shown in Table 2 as percent inhibition @ 20 μM, and in Table 3 as percent inhibition @ 5 μM.

Compound #37 reduces SREBP cleavage in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 4.6 μM in HepG2 cells when analyzed by Western blot following 24 hours of treatment (FIG. 1A and FIG. 1B).
Inhibition of SREBP activity by Compound #37 was further demonstrated in a HepG2 reporter cell line with luciferase synthesis driven by an SREBP-responsible promoter (HepG2_LSSprom). HepG2_LSSprom cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 24 hours. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of Compound #37 or an equal volume of DMSO in culture medium without serum. Luciferase expression was measured and compared after 6 hours of treatment. The results are shown in FIG. 1C. Similar to the results shown by Western blot, Compound #37 reduced luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of 2.7 μM
In these complementary SREBP cell-based activity assays, Compound #37 consistently exhibited an IC50 between 2 and 5 μM for inhibiting SREBP activation. Consistent with the dependence on de novo lipogenesis, inhibition of SREBP activation by Compound #37 in this cell-based model led to decreased viability of HepG2 cells with an IC50 of 2.1 μM, as shown in FIG. 1B.
Example B1B
Effect of Compound #37 on Gene Expression in HepG2 Cells
HepG2 cells were incubated with 10 μM Compound #37 in DMSO in serum-free conditions for 16 hours followed by microarray analysis of SREBP-driven gene expression performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. This analysis revealed that the major SREBP pathways involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis were down-regulated in Compound #37-treated cells. Many of the genes altered are direct transcriptional targets of SREBP, indicating that inhibition of SREBP cleavage by Compound #37 is sufficient to reduce expression of SREBP target genes. A summary of lipid and cholesterol pathways down-regulated by Compound #37 is presented in FIG. 3.
Overall, the in vitro studies in Examples B1A and B1B demonstrate that Compound #37 prevents SREBP cleavage activation, and as a consequence, down-regulates SREBP target gene expression. These data are consistent with the inhibition of SREBP activation demonstrated by fatostatin (Kamisuki et al, 2009).

Example B3
Effects of Compound #37 on Liver Injuries in a Short-Term (21 day) Induced NASH Mouse Model
This example demonstrates the effects of Compound #37 on liver injuries in a short-term (21 day) induced NASH mouse model generated using a 60% high fat Paigen diet.
C57BL/6J mice who are fed an atherogenic Paigen diet, a high-fat (60% fat), high-cholesterol (1.25%) diet supplemented with cholate (0.5%) have been shown to have acute liver damage with significant, predominantly mononuclear, leukocyte infiltration in the liver, severe hepatic steatosis, elevated hepatic expression of inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, RANTES, and MIP-2), increased serum liver transaminase concentrations, and increased molecular markers of fibrosis (Desai et al, 2008; Vergnes et al, 2003; Nishina et al, 1993).
To investigate whether Compound #37 prevents the development of pathology associated with NASH and steatosis in an acute exploratory disease model, a study was conducted using a diet-induced acute liver steatosis model in mice. As described below, in this study, C57BL/6J mice were initiated on the Paigen diet and simultaneously treated with Compound #37 (5, 20, and 40 mg/kg/day) or vehicle control (20% HPβCD 10 mL/kg/day) by oral gavage for 21 days.
After acclimation, 8-week old male C57B1/6J mice (Charles River) weighing about 25 g were randomized in 4 groups according their body weight and treated once daily around noon by oral gavage with vehicle, or Compound #37 at various for 21 days as follows: Group 1: vehicle-20% (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CD) (n=10); Group 2: Compound #37, 5 mg/kg (n=10) Group 3: Compound #37, 20 mg/kg (n=10) Group 4: Compound #37, 40 mg/kg (n=10). During the treatment period, body weight and food intake (measured over 24h) were measured 3 times per week and once a week, respectively. During the acclimation, all mice were fed a standard diet (Special Diets Services RM1 (E), product no. 801492) and tap water ad libitum. After the acclimation period, mice were fed until the end of the experiment with a 60% high fat Paigen diet (60 kcal % fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% cholate; D11061901, Research Diet) and tap water ad libitum.
After 21 days of treatment, mice were 4-hour fasted (9 am to 1 pm). One hour after the last dosing (noon), blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeding (maximal volume on EDTA) under isoflurane anesthesia to measure plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acid, ALT and AST. Mice were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and livers were harvested and weighed. Liver samples from the same lobe were dissected, frozen, and analyzed as described below.
Data Analysis. Values are presented as mean±standard error of the mean (sem). To assess the compound effect, treated groups were compared to vehicle with a 1-way ANOVA+Dunnett's post-test. When variances were significantly different a Kruskall-Wallis test was performed. For RT-qPCR and score Kruskall-Wallis test was performed with Dunns post-test. For body weight evolution the treated groups were compared to vehicle with a 2-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test. For each test, a p<0.05 was considered significant.
Results. The day following the start of diet and treatment, Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg and at 40 mg/kg induced a body weight decrease and death in some mice. Treatment with Compound #37 at 40 mg/kg was stopped after 4 administrations. Mice were maintained on specific diet and were sacrificed after 9 days of diet. The treatment with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg was maintained, and the mice that were still alive recovered. Body weight evolution of Compound #37-treated groups was similar to vehicle and was associated with similar food intake.
After 21 days of diet, treatment with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg tended to prevent plasma ALT and AST increase. Mice treated with Compound #37 at 40 mg/kg displayed very high ALT and AST levels at day 9, which may be related to an acute effect of the diet or the potential liver toxicity effect of Compound #37 at 40 mg/kg in combination with the diet. After 21 days, treatment with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg significantly decreased free fatty acids and tended to prevent triglyceride plasma levels. Plasma cholesterol levels were unchanged. See Tables 5A and 5B.

Oil Red O staining. One 0.5 cm3 piece of liver was frozen in OCT in isopentane and stored at −80° C. for neutral lipid coloration with quantification to evaluate accumulation of neutral lipids in the liver. One section (thickness 5-7 μm) per block was deposited on superfrost+slides for Red Oil staining. Red Oil-stained slides were digitalized at ×20 with the Nanozoomer 2.0 HT. Red Oil labeling was quantified (surface, density): the stained slides were analyzed using an image. All the samples were analyzed within the same range of labeling intensity (0-130), allowing comparison between animals. The intensity scale ranged from 0 to 255 grey levels, in which 0 is the value of a black pixel, and 255 is the value of a white pixel. The staining intensity was calculated as the mean intensity of each pixel composing the labeling signal. For each slide, the percentage (%) of labeling was also calculated: %=(Surface of labeling*100)/section area.
There were deposits in the OCT, which contributed to the red oil signal from the lipids. A high variability of response in the vehicle group was observed, due in part to one animal. However, treatment with Compound #37 tended to prevent the accumulation of neutral lipids, which was correlated with the tendency of liver triglycerides to decrease. Liver lipids and cholesterol metabolism genes were analyzed by RT-qPCR and were unchanged by the treatment except for the ACC1 gene. Compound #37 decreased ACC1 liver gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. See Tables 7A and 7B.

Hepatic expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism (FAS, SREBP1, ACC1, SCD1), cholesterol metabolism (HMG-CoAR, LDLR), SREBP proteolysis (SCAP, INSIG1), ER stress (PERK), oxidative stress (NRF2), inflammation (MCP-1), and fibrosis (collagen 1α1) were quantified by RTqPCR. Expression level was normalized to 18S gene expression and relative expression to vehicle group was calculated with the 2-t method.
The 60% high fat Paigen diet induced accumulation of liver lipids, inflammation, oxidative stress, and then fibrosis. Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg tended to decrease in a non-significant manner some gene expression markers of inflammation and oxidative stress, but no clear modifications were observed. Expression of these genes was unchanged in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg, but a tendency to prevent increase in liver IL-6 levels was observed. Compound #37 treatment tended to decrease expression of the collagen 1α1 gene in a dose-dependent manner. The results are shown in Tables 8-13.

NAFLD score analysis. A 0.5 cm3 piece of liver was fixed in 10% formalin for 48-72h, stored in ethanol 70° at 4° C., and processed for eosin/hematoxylin staining and NAFLD score analysis. One section (thickness 3-5 μm) per block was deposited on Superfrost+slides for hematoxylin-eosin staining. Individual slides having a single hepatic lobe section stained with H&E were digitized using a Nanozoomer from Hamamatsu. Sections were evaluated with knowledge of groups. Each section was evaluated and individually scored. A NAFLD scoring system (NAS) adapted from Kleiner et al. (Hepatology 41, 1313-21, 2005), Wu et al. (BMC Vet. Res. 10, 162, 2014), and Lee et al. (J. Lipid Res. 48, 1885-96, 2007). A total of four variables were qualitatively assessed and ranked with a score: (1) hepatocellular steatosis, (2) liver inflammation, (3) lobular fibrosis, and (4) hepatocyte ballooning. The criteria for score assignments are presented in the table below.

NAS scores were determined based on histopathological analysis of steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis. The most remarkable lesion contributing to the NAS scores in the vehicle group and in the groups treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg was interstitial inflammation ranging from a Grade 1 to a Grade 3 in all animals in all three groups. A grade-3 inflammation was noted in 2/10 animals in the vehicle-treated group, 4/10 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg, and 1/6 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg. Inflammation was accompanied by limited periportal fibrosis (mostly Grade 1) in 9/10 animals in the vehicle-treated group, 10/10 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg, and 3/6 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg. Grade 1 hepatocellular steatosis was observed in 7/10 animals in the vehicle-treated group, 9/10 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg, and 3/6 animals in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg. A grade 2 hepatocellular steatosis was also observed in one animal each in the vehicle-treated group and the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg, but not in animals treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg.
There was no inflammation noted in the animals treated with Compound #37 at 40 mg/kg. Inflammation was accompanied by limited periportal fibrosis but was not observed at day 9 in animals treated with Compound #37 at 40 mg/kg. The hepatocellular steatosis was more pronounced (Grade 2) in that group. The steatosis was accompanied by hepatocellular ballooning, which was inconsistently noted in vehicle-treated group and the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg group, but was absent in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg.
Overall, the NAS scores in the vehicle-treated group and the group treated with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg were slightly higher than that observed in the group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg, reflecting an apparent difference severity and extent of the inflammatory and lipidic changes. The group treated with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg was the least severely affected.
Lesions of NAFLD observed in this study were consistent to that previously described and reviewed by Imajo et al. (2013). The hyper-inflammatory response was accompanied by some evidence of fibrosis.
Although this experiment did not demonstrate a clear dose-dependent effect of treatment with Compound #37, treatment at 20 mg/kg appeared to be the most effective in reducing most of the liver injuries induced in this specific diet-induced NASH mouse model. Plasma ALT and ALT levels were reduced as well as liver steatosis. Finally NAS score assessed by histopathological analysis was also improved with reduced inflammation, steatosis, and hepatocyte ballooning as well as fibrosis.
The results are shown in Tables 14A and 14B.

Summary of the Results and Discussion. The Paigen diet in the C57B1/6J mouse strain typically results in an initial acute weight loss that recovers over time (Hebbard & George, 2011; vendor historical unpublished data). Animals receiving this diet with Compound #37 were observed to have an added dose-dependent decrease in food intake within the first week of dosing that led to marked weight loss and resulting toxicity. The Compound #37 40 mg/kg/day treatment group (10 mice) exhibited a marked decrease in food intake and >20% mean weight loss over 4 days of treatment, leading to the death of 3 mice by day 7 and the death of an additional 3 mice by day 9. Dosing of this group was stopped on day 4 and the surviving mice were sacrificed on day 9, 1 hour after a final dose to analyze drug exposure. The Compound #37 20 mg/kg/day group (10 mice) also demonstrated decreased food intake and weight loss; 4 mice with the most pronounced weight loss died (1 on day 7, 2 on day 9, 1 on day 11). The other 6 mice in the group exhibited less dramatic weight loss, survived, and regained weight similar to vehicle group animals. No mice died in the Compound #37 5 mg/kg/day or vehicle control groups (10 mice each group).
The death of animals in the Compound #37 40 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day groups appears to be related to synergistic weight loss due to a combination of the Paigen diet and the inappetence effects of Compound #37 observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs. By the end of the 3-week dosing period, no differences in weight were observed among the animals that survived the full study in the vehicle control, Compound #37 5 mg/kg/day, and Compound #37 20 mg/kg/day treatment groups (Table B3). Compound #37 mean plasma concentration 1 hour after final dose administration on day 21 was 20.4 μM(±4.33 μM) and 112 μM(±26.0 μM) for the 5 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg groups, respectively. The Compound #37 mean plasma concentration 1 hour after final dose administration for the 4 animals on day 9 in the 40 mg/kg group was 136 μM (±37.1 μM). These exposures at 1 hour after dosing are approximately 2-fold higher than those observed in healthy mice and may be related to altered Compound #37 metabolism in this acute liver injury model.

The severe food intake decrease and animal deaths confound the interpretation of the results in this cholate-based model. No consistent observations in hepatic lipid concentrations or SREBP-related target gene expression levels were evident in surviving animals receiving Compound #37 compared with the vehicle control group; however, lower plasma triglyceride and free fatty acid concentrations were observed in a dose-dependent manner. Of note, after 21 days of treatment in this model, liver transaminases were markedly increased for all treatment groups, consistent with the diet-induced liver injury, but trended toward lower values in the Compound #37 treatment groups compared with the vehicle control group (Table 5A). The 4 surviving animals in the 40 mg/kg group were found to have markedly elevated liver transaminases at the time of sacrifice on day 9 (mean AST and ALT>2500 U/L); however, no control animals were sacrificed at this time point for comparison.
Example B4
Effect of Compound #37 in an Obese Insulin-Resistant Mouse Diet-Induced NASH Model (DIN Model)
This example demonstrates that Compound #37 tends to improve insulin resistance and reduced liver fibrosis in a diet-induced NASH obese insulin resistant mice.
Male C57B1/6J mice (8 weeks old) were housed in enriched ventilated cages (31×12.5×12.7 cm) throughout the experimental phase. Animals' cages litters were changed at least once a week. Animal were housed 5 per cage on inverted 12-hour light cycle (at 09:00 am lights off), 22±2° C. and 55±10% relative humidity. The acclimation period was 20 days. During the acclimation period, all mice were fed a standard diet (RM1 (E) 801492, SDS) and tap water ad libitum. After the acclimation period, mice were fed with the DIN diet (60% fat, cholesterol enriched) and fructose-enriched tap water ad libitum until the end of the experiment.
At 6 weeks of diet, mice were 4-hour fasted (09:00 am to 1:00 pm) and blood (150 μl/EDTA) was collected at 01:00 pm by retro-orbital bleeding under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were then allocated in 2 homogenous groups (n=12/group) according to their plasma levels of ALT (average levels: 685U/L), AST (average levels: 627U/L) and HOMA-IR index (average value: 4.7), into 2 homogenous groups (see values at day 0 in Tables 15A and 15B ALT/AST and Tables 16A and 16B for HOMA-IR). Mice were then treated once daily by oral gavage with vehicle (Group 1) or Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg (Group 2) for 70 days.
Results. A non-significant trend towards lower body weight and body weight gain was observed in mice treated with Compound #37, with no major change observed regarding food intake. Water intake tended to be higher in mice treated with, resulting in a 17% increase in cumulative water intake (p<0.05 vs. vehicle). One animal in the 20 mg/kg/day treatment group died on day 48.
Although a trend towards lower AST plasma levels was observed in mice treated with Compound #37, no significant change was observed in plasma ALT/AST levels and area under the curve during the 70-day treatment (Tables 15A and 15B).
Blood glucose levels were not altered by Compound #37 treatment. However, plasma insulin levels tended to be reduced with Compound #37, leading to lower HOMA-IR index at day 42 and day 70 (50 and 40% reduction), although this trend was not significant. At the end of the treatment period, plasma leptin levels were significantly reduced by 38% with Compound #37 (p<0.05 vs. vehicle). These results are presented in Tables 16A and 16B.
Although mice treated with Compound #37 showed increased HDL-cholesterol by 31% (p<0.05 vs. vehicle), no significant change was observed in plasma lipids levels at the end of the treatment period. See Table 17.
Liver weight was significantly higher (by 21%) in mice treated with Compound #37. Hepatic total cholesterol levels were raised by 17% (p<0.05 vs. vehicle). However, liver fatty acids and triglycerides levels remained unchanged. See Table 18A. Hepatic MCP-1 levels were reduced by 70% (p<0.001 vs. vehicle) in mice treated with Compound #37; see Table 18B.
Slides having a single hepatic lobe section stained with H&E and Sims red were digitized using a Nanozoomer from Hamamatsu. Sections were evaluated with knowledge of groups. In agreement with the unchanged hepatic triglycerides levels, oil red O staining and % labeling was not changed with Compound #37. A substantial reduction in Sirius Red labeling was also observed, leading to a 61% reduction (p<0.001 vs. vehicle) in % labeling. These results are presented in Table 18B.
Each section was evaluated and individually scored using the modified NAFLD scoring system described above. The results of the NAS scoring are shown in Table 19. Although inflammation scores were low in both groups (0-1), NAS scoring (FIG. 10) showed a significant 81% increase in the inflammation score (p<0.05 vs. vehicle) for mice treated with Compound #37. In agreement with the Sirius Red % labeling, fibrosis score was reduced by 45%, although this did not reach significance (p=0.055 vs. vehicle). While steatosis and hepatocyte ballooning scores remained unchanged, total NAS score did not change with Compound #37.
The results of the gene expression analysis are presented in Tables 20A-20L. Hepatic expression levels of genes involved in lipid (FAS, SREBP1, ACC1, SCD1), cholesterol metabolism (HMG-CoAR, LDLR), in SREBP proteolysis (SCAP, INSIG1), in ER stress (PERK), oxidative stress (NRF2), and inflammation (MCP-1) were not changed. However, expression of collagen 1α1, involved in liver fibrosis, was reduced by 66% in mice treated with Compound #37 (p<0.05 vs. vehicle).
Conclusion. In the diet-induced NASH obese insulin resistant mice, Compound #37 tends to improve insulin resistance and reduce liver fibrosis.

Example B5
Effect of Compound #37 on Plasma and Liver Lipid Levels in ob/ob Mice
This example demonstrates the effect of Compound #37 on plasma and liver lipid levels in ob/ob mice.
Groups of mice were either untreated (group 1) or treated for 8 weeks with vehicle (group 2), or with Compound #37 at 5 mg/kg (group 3), 10 mg/kg (group 4), or 20 mg/kg (group 5). Treatment was daily by oral gavage in vehicle (20% HPβCD). Values are presented as mean±standard error of the mean (sem). A t test was performed to compare the untreated group and the vehicle group. Then Compound #37-treated groups were compared to the vehicle-treated group with a 1-way ANOVA+Dunnett's post-test. When variances were significantly different, a Kruskaii-Wallis test was performed. For each test, a p<0.05 was considered significant. Of note, animal #39, group 1 was excluded from the statistical analysis, due to low values for all parameters measured. Some other values were considered as out-liners and excluded from the statistical analysis when the value was far below the mean minus 2 SD. Excluded values are marked with an asterisk in Tables 21-23.
Results. At the end of experiment, the ob/ob mice treated with vehicle alone, in comparison to the untreated mice, displayed a significant increase in plasma triglyceride levels (p<0.01) and, inversely, a significant plasma insulin level decrease (p<0.01). The plasma total cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids levels were unchanged (Table 21).
Treatment with Compound #37 at 10 mg/kg treatment tended to decrease plasma triglycerides levels. Compound #37 decreased dose-dependently levels of non-esterified fatty acids and total cholesterol levels. Plasma insulin levels were unchanged with the treatment or tended to increase with treatment with Compound #37 at 20 mg/kg. See Table 21.
Treatment with 5 mg/kg of Compound #37 significantly decreased liver triglyceride and fatty acids levels, as shown in Table 22. This decrease was correlated with results obtained with Oil red O staining at the same dose; see Table 23.
The treatment was generally well tolerated over 8 weeks, with no significant differences in weight gain and food intake across all treatment groups (Compound #37P042). Compound #37 treatment resulted in a reduction in plasma triglyceride, as well as a statistically significant (p<0.05) dose-dependent reduction in plasma free fatty acids and total cholesterol concentrations. These plasma lipid results are consistent with SCAP/SREBP pathway inhibition seen in tissue-specific SCAP knockout mice (Horton et al, 2002) and with inhibition of SREBP in vivo (Moon et al, 2012).
Lipid accumulation was reduced in the livers of Compound #37-treated ob/ob mice (Compound #37P042), as indicated by a reduction in triglycerides, fatty acids, total cholesterol, and Oil Red O staining of hepatic neutral lipids; however, these reductions were variable (Compound #37P054, Table 2.6.2-2). Quantification of Oil Red O staining showed a decrease at the 5 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day doses; however, these decreases were not statistically significant. The 10 mg/kg/day dose resulted in no reduction in Oil Red O staining despite reducing plasma lipids. Compound #37 had no effect on hepatic cholesterol concentrations. The variability in these findings may be due to the severity of steatosis that develops in this model or the quantification methods used. Fasting blood glucose and insulin concentrations were highly variable across groups without significant changes from the vehicle control group.
Conclusion. Vehicle alone modified plasma triglycerides and insulin levels. Treatment with Compound #37 decreased in a dose-dependent manner non-esterified fatty acid levels and total cholesterol and tended to decrease triglycerides. At 5 mg/kg, Compound #37 significantly decreased liver triglycerides and fatty acids, indicating that treatment with Compound #37 improves liver steatosis in ob/ob mice.

Effect of Compound #37 in a Diet-Induced Chronic Steatosis/NASH Model
To investigate whether Compound #37 improves pre-existing steatosis/NASH pathology, a study was conducted using a 16-week diet-induced NASH mouse model. In this model, mice develop steatosis that progresses with inflammation and fibrosis that mimic many of the observed pathologies in human nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and NASH (Hebbard & George, 2010). For 6 weeks, mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet and provided drinking water containing fructose to induce liver pathology (Charlton et al, 2011). After 6 weeks, the mice were divided into 2 groups with similar mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values (n=12 mice), although it should be noted that AST and ALT concentrations within both groups were higher and with greater variability than anticipated (e.g., mean ALT 677 U/L [SD, 401 U/L] in the vehicle control group and 693 U/L [SD, 365 U/L] in the Compound #37 group). After the animals were divided into 2 groups, the diet was continued for 10 additional weeks during which time 1 group received vehicle and the other was treated with 20 mg/kg/day Compound #37.
Compound #37 was generally well tolerated in this model with no important differences in weight gain between treatment groups after the first week of treatment. One animal in the Compound #37 treatment group died after 48 days of treatment with no obvious cause of death; gavage error in dosing could not be ruled out. This death rate is within historical norms for long-term diet-induced NASH studies at this vendor.
Overall, no consistent findings were observed in plasma or hepatic lipid concentrations, degree of steatosis, or SREBP-related target gene expression levels between treatment groups, although the degree of variability of liver injury in the animals at baseline makes the results difficult to interpret. No evidence of hepatotoxicity with Compound #37 was observed in this study; transaminase concentrations were similar between treatment groups throughout the study.
Notably, while Compound #37 did not cause an overt reduction in liver lipid content, a significant reduction in the formation of collagen fiber formation was demonstrated by decreased Sirius Red staining (FIG. 4). Furthermore, mean liver collagen α1(I)mRNA was also significantly down-regulated by Compound #37 treatment (1.45% vs 0.49%; p<0.05), suggesting a potential effect on liver fibrosis.
Compound #37 treatment also resulted in a trend toward lower homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) scores due to reduced plasma insulin. Glucose concentrations were in the normal range and were largely unchanged for the Compound #37-treated mice, indicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity without concurrent hypoglycemia (FIGS. 5A-C). Compound #37-treated mice also had a 38% reduction in plasma leptin concentrations, a hormone associated with adiposity, but these findings were not statistically significant.

Pharmacology Data From 28-Day Repeat-Dose Toxicity Studies in Healthy Rats and Dogs
In addition to standard safety endpoints, pharmacology endpoints were assessed as part of a 28-day repeat-dose toxicity studies in healthy rats and dogs.
In the repeat-dose toxicity study in rats (Compound #37P018), Compound #37 was given at 0 (vehicle control), 50, 100/75, and 200/150 mg/kg/day for 28 days; some animals from each dose group continued into a 28-day recovery period. After 28 days of treatment, liver neutral lipids from treated and control animals were analyzed with Oil Red O staining. This analysis demonstrated a trend towards decreased concentrations of neutral lipids in the liver in an Compound #37 dose-dependent manner (summarized in Table B7; representative micrographs are presented in FIG. 6) without effects on liver glycogen.

The more pronounced effects in female rats compared with male rats is consistent with the observed higher plasma exposure (>4-fold higher area under the curve over 24 hours [AUC24h]) at day 28 in females compared with males. Evidence of an effect of Compound #37 on leptin concentrations was also observed in female rats in a dose-dependent manner. As animals gain weight, leptin concentrations naturally increase due to its origin from adipose tissue. Female rats treated with Compound #37 had lower concentrations of leptin compared with the vehicle control group during the treatment period (day 4 and day 28), which was not observed after treatment termination and recovery (day 56) (FIG. 7). In male rats, decreases in leptin concentrations were only observed at the highest dose group, likely due to lower systemic exposures of Compound #37 as noted above.
In the repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs, Compound #37 was given at 0 (vehicle control), 0.5, 2, 5, and 10/7.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days; some animals from each dose group continued into a 28-day recovery period (vehicle, 5, and 10/7.5 mg/kg/day groups only). Observations included trends of mild to moderate decreases in serum triglyceride (FIGS. 8A-B) and cholesterol concentrations (FIGS. 9A-B) at Compound #37 doses≧5 mg/kg/day. These Compound #37-related changes were reversible at the end of the 28-day recovery period. Findings were similar between male and female dogs, and consistent with the lack of sex differences in plasma exposure.
