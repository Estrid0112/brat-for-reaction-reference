BACKGROUND OF INVENTION
Microbial pathogens are becoming increasingly resistant to current antibiotics, limiting the availability of clinical treatment options for bacterial infections (1). It is imperative to develop novel classes of antibacterial compounds, preferably against a new target, to avoid cross-resistance. Tuberculosis (TB) infects 9.6 million people a year and causes 1.5 million deaths each year (2). The problem presented by multi-drug resistance is illustrated by the 480,000 cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) that do not respond to first line treatment drugs, with around ten percent of these cases being extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) that are resistant to even some of the second line drugs (2, 3). New combinations of anti-TB drugs are needed to treat the MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases.
Topoisomerases are needed in every organism to regulate DNA topology so that vital cellular processes including DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair can proceed without hindrance (4, 5). Type IIA topoisomerases cut and rejoin a double strand of DNA during catalysis (6). DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are prokaryotic type HA topoisomerases that have been extensively explored as validated targets for antibacterial therapy in the clinic (7, 8). At least one type IA topoisomerase is present in every bacterial pathogen to resolve topological barriers that require the cutting and rejoining of a single strand of DNA and passage of DNA through the transient break (9). Topoisomerase I is the major type IA topoisomerase activity responsible for preventing excessive negative supercoiling in bacteria (10, 11).
Bacterial topoisomerase has received some recent interest as a novel antibacterial drug target (9, 12). Poison inhibitors of topoisomerase enzymes can lead to the accumulation of the intermediate topoisomerase-DNA cleavage complex and subsequently result in bacterial or cancer cell death. Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (EcTopI) is the most extensively studied type IA topoisomerase, with crystal structures of covalent cleavage complex (13) and full-length enzyme-DNA complex (14) available. Inhibition of EcTopI by endogenous polypeptide inhibitors (15-17) can lead to cell killing even though compensatory mutations could allow E. coli strains with topA deletion to be viable (18, 19). There is also evidence that topoisomerase I function is essential for a number of bacterial pathogens including Streptococcus pneumoniae (20) and Helicobacter pylori (21). There is only one type IA topoisomerase encoded by the genomes of Mycobacteria. Mycobacterium tuberculosis topoisomerase I (MtbTop1) has been demonstrated in genetic studies to be essential for viability both in vitro (22, 23) and in vivo (23). Experimental data showed that the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of select small molecules against Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be shifted by overexpression of topoisomerase I (23, 24), further validating topoisomerase I as a vulnerable target in M. tuberculosis for chemical inhibition.
Clinically, topoisomerase enzymes represent attractive and successful targets for anticancer and antibacterial chemotherapy. Many of the small molecules identified previously as bacterial topoisomerase I inhibitors are DNA intercalators (20, 24-26) or minor groove binders (27, 28) that would not be attractive candidates for antibiotics development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop compounds that target bacterial pathogens, in particular, through the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase I.

Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the disclosure.
It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that certain compounds of this disclosure may exist in tautomeric forms, all such tautomeric forms of the compounds being within the scope of the disclosure. The term “tautomer,” as used herein, refers to one of two or more structural isomers which exist in equilibrium and which are readily converted from one isomeric form to another.
Chemical Definitions
The terms substituted, whether preceded by the term “optionally” or not, and substituent, as used herein, refer to the ability to change one functional group for another functional group provided that the valency of all atoms is maintained. When more than one position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at every position. The substituents also may be further substituted (e.g., an aryl group substituent may have another substituent off it, such as an alkyl group, which is further substituted, for example, with fluorine at one or more positions).
Where a group may be substituted by one or more of a number of substituents, such substitutions are selected so as to comply with principles of chemical bonding and to give compounds that are not inherently unstable and/or would be known to one of ordinary skill in the art as likely to be unstable under ambient conditions, such as aqueous, neutral, and several known physiological conditions. For example, a heterocycloalkyl or heteroaryl is attached to the remainder of the molecule via a ring heteroatom in compliance with principles of chemical bonding known to those skilled in the art thereby avoiding inherently unstable compounds.
The term “alkyl,” by itself or as part of another substituent, means, unless otherwise stated, a straight (i.e., unbranched) or branched chain, acyclic or cyclic hydrocarbon group, or combination thereof, which may be fully saturated, mono- or polyunsaturated and can include di- and multivalent groups, having the number of carbon atoms designated (i.e., C1-C10 means one to ten carbons). In particular embodiments, the term “alkyl” refers to C1-20 inclusive, linear (i.e., “straight-chain”), branched, or cyclic, saturated or at least partially and in some cases fully unsaturated (i.e., alkenyl and alkynyl)hydrocarbon radicals derived from a hydrocarbon moiety containing between one and twenty carbon atoms by removal of a single hydrogen atom.
Representative saturated hydrocarbon groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, sec-pentyl, iso-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl, sec-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-decyl, n-undecyl, dodecyl, cyclohexyl, (cyclohexyl)methyl, cyclopropylmethyl, and homologs and isomers thereof.
“Branched” refers to an alkyl group in which a lower alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl or propyl, is attached to a linear alkyl chain. “Lower alkyl” refers to an alkyl group having 1 to about 8 carbon atoms (i.e., a C1-8 alkyl), e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 carbon atoms. “Higher alkyl” refers to an alkyl group having about 10 to about 20 carbon atoms, e.g., 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20 carbon atoms. In certain embodiments, “alkyl” refers, in particular, to C1-8 straight-chain alkyls. In other embodiments, “alkyl” refers, in particular, to C1-8 branched-chain alkyls.
Alkyl groups can optionally be substituted (a “substituted alkyl”) with one or more alkyl group substituents, which can be the same or different. The term “alkyl group substituent” includes but is not limited to alkyl, substituted alkyl, halo, arylamino, acyl, hydroxyl, aryloxyl, alkoxyl, alkylthio, arylthio, aralkyloxyl, aralkylthio, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, oxo, and cycloalkyl. There can be optionally inserted along the alkyl chain one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms, wherein the nitrogen substituent is hydrogen, lower alkyl (also referred to herein as “alkylaminoalkyl”), or aryl.
Thus, as used herein, the term “substituted alkyl” includes alkyl groups, as defined herein, in which one or more atoms or functional groups of the alkyl group are replaced with another atom or functional group, including for example, alkyl, substituted alkyl, halogen, aryl, substituted aryl, alkoxyl, hydroxyl, nitro, amino, alkylamino, dialkylamino, sulfate, and mercapto.
The term “heteroalkyl,” by itself or in combination with another term, means, unless otherwise stated, a stable straight or branched chain, or cyclic hydrocarbon group, or combinations thereof, consisting of at least one carbon atoms and at least one heteroatom selected from the group consisting of O, N, P, Si and S, and wherein the nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur atoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. The heteroatom(s) O, N, P and S and Si may be placed at any interior position of the heteroalkyl group or at the position at which alkyl group is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples include, but are not limited to, -CH2-CH2-O-CH3, -CH2-CH2-NH-CH3, -CH3, -CH2-CH2-N(CH3)-CH3, -CH2-S-CH2-CH3, -CH-CH25-S(O)-CH3, -CH2-S(O)2-CH3, -CH═CH-O-CH3, -Si(CH3)3, -CH2-CH═N-OCH3, -CH═CH-N(CH3)-CH3, O-CH3, -O-CH2-CH3, and -CN. Up to two or three heteroatoms may be consecutive, such as, for example, -CH2-NH-OCH3 and -CH2-O-Si(CH3)3.
As described above, heteroalkyl groups, as used herein, include those groups that are attached to the remainder of the molecule through a heteroatom, such as -C(O)R', -C(O)NR', -NR'R″, -OR', -SR, and/or -SO2R'. Where “heteroalkyl” is recited, followed by recitations of specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R or the like, it will be understood that the terms heteroalkyl and -NR'R″ are not redundant or mutually exclusive. Rather, the specific heteroalkyl groups are recited to add clarity. Thus, the term “heteroalkyl” should not be interpreted herein as excluding specific heteroalkyl groups, such as -NR'R″ or the like.
“Cyclic” and “cycloalkyl” refer to a non-aromatic mono- or multicyclic ring system of about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms, e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 carbon atoms. The cycloalkyl group can be optionally partially unsaturated. The cycloalkyl group also can be optionally substituted with an alkyl group substituent as defined herein, oxo, and/or alkylene. There can be optionally inserted along the cyclic alkyl chain one or more oxygen, sulfur or substituted or unsubstituted nitrogen atoms, wherein the nitrogen substituent is hydrogen, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, or substituted aryl, thus providing a heterocyclic group. Representative monocyclic cycloalkyl rings include cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cycloheptyl. Multicyclic cycloalkyl rings include adamantyl, octahydronaphthyl, decalin, camphor, camphane, and noradamantyl, and fused ring systems, such as dihydro- and tetrahydronaphthalene, and the like.
The term “cycloalkylalkyl,” as used herein, refers to a cycloalkyl group as defined hereinabove, which is attached to the parent molecular moiety through an alkyl group, also as defined above. Examples of cycloalkylalkyl groups include cyclopropylmethyl and cyclopentylethyl.
The terms “cycloheteroalkyl” or “heterocycloalkyl” refer to a non-aromatic ring system, unsaturated or partially unsaturated ring system, such as a 3- to 10-member substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl ring system, including one or more heteroatoms, which can be the same or different, and are selected from the group consisting of nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), and silicon (Si), and optionally can include one or more double bonds.
The cycloheteroalkyl ring can be optionally fused to or otherwise attached to other cycloheteroalkyl rings and/or non-aromatic hydrocarbon rings. Heterocyclic rings include those having from one to three heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, in which the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may optionally be oxidized and the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized. In certain embodiments, the term heterocylic refers to a non-aromatic 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring or a polycyclic group wherein at least one ring atom is a heteroatom selected from O, S, and N (wherein the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized), including, but not limited to, a bi- or tri-cyclic group, comprising fused six-membered rings having between one and three heteroatoms independently selected from the oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen, wherein (i) each 5-membered ring has 0 to 2 double bonds, each 6-membered ring has 0 to 2 double bonds, and each 7-membered ring has 0 to 3 double bonds, (ii) the nitrogen and sulfur heteroatoms may be optionally oxidized, (iii) the nitrogen heteroatom may optionally be quaternized, and (iv) any of the above heterocyclic rings may be fused to an aryl or heteroaryl ring. Representative cycloheteroalkyl ring systems include, but are not limited to pyrrolidinyl, pyrrolinyl, imidazolidinyl, imidazolinyl, pyrazolidinyl, pyrazolinyl, piperidyl, piperazinyl, indolinyl, quinuclidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, thiadiazinanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, and the like.
The terms “cycloalkyl” and “heterocycloalkyl”, by themselves or in combination with other terms, represent, unless otherwise stated, cyclic versions of “alkyl” and “heteroalkyl”, respectively. Additionally, for heterocycloalkyl, a heteroatom can occupy the position at which the heterocycle is attached to the remainder of the molecule. Examples of cycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 1-cyclohexenyl, 3-cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, and the like. Examples of heterocycloalkyl include, but are not limited to, 1-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridyl), 1-piperidinyl, 2-piperidinyl, 3-piperidinyl, 4-morpholinyl, 3-morpholinyl, tetrahydrofuran-2-yl, tetrahydrofuran-3-yl, tetrahydrothien-2-yl, tetrahydrothien-3-yl, 1-piperazinyl, 2-piperazinyl, and the like. The terms “cycloalkylene” and “heterocycloalkylene” refer to the divalent derivatives of cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl, respectively.
An unsaturated alkyl group is one having one or more double bonds or triple bonds. Examples of unsaturated alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, vinyl, 2-propenyl, crotyl, 2-isopentenyl, 2-(butadienyl), 2,4-pentadienyl, 3-(1,4-pentadienyl), ethynyl, 1- and 3-propynyl, 3-butynyl, and the higher homologs and isomers. Alkyl groups which are limited to hydrocarbon groups are termed “homoalkyl.”
Each of above terms (e.g., “alkyl,” “heteroalkyl,” “cycloalkyl, and “heterocycloalkyl,” as well as their divalent derivatives) are meant to include both substituted and unsubstituted forms of the indicated group. Optional substituents for each type of group are provided below.
Substituents for alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl monovalent and divalent derivative groups (including those groups often referred to as alkylene, alkenyl, heteroalkylene, heteroalkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and heterocycloalkenyl) can be one or more of a variety of groups selected from, but not limited to: -OR', ═O, ═NR', ═N-OR', -NR'R″, -SR', -halogen, -SiR'R″R″, -OC(O)R', -C(O)R', -CO2R', -C(O)NR'R″, -OC(O)NR'R″, -NR″C(O)R', -NR'-C(O)NR″R″, NR″C(O)OR', -NR-C(NR'R″)═NR'″. -S(O)R', -S(O)2R', -S(O)2NR'R″, -NRSO2R', -CN and -NO2 in a number ranging from zero to (2 m'+1), where m' is the total number of carbon atoms in such groups. R', R″, R'″ and R″″ each may independently refer to hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted heteroalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl (e.g., aryl substituted with 1-3 halogens), substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, alkoxy or thioalkoxy groups, or arylalkyl groups. As used herein, an “alkoxy” group is an alkyl attached to the remainder of the molecule through a divalent oxygen. When a compound of the disclosure includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R', R″, R'″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. When R' and R″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, -NR'R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., -CF3 and -CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., -C(O)CH3, -C(O)CF3, -C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).
Unless otherwise explicitly defined, a “substituent group,” as used herein, includes a functional group selected from one or more of the following moieties, which are defined herein: (A) -OH, -NH2, -SH, -CN, -CF3, -NO2, oxo, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and (B) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from: (i) oxo, -OH, -NH2, -SH, -CN, -CF, -NO2, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and (ii) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from: (a) oxo, -OH, -NH2, -SH, -CN, -CF3, -NO2, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, unsubstituted heteroaryl, and (b) alkyl, heteroalkyl, cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl, substituted with at least one substituent selected from oxo, -OH, -NH, -SH, -CN, -CF3, -NO2, halogen, unsubstituted alkyl, unsubstituted heteroalkyl, unsubstituted cycloalkyl, unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, unsubstituted aryl, and unsubstituted heteroaryl.

In one embodiment, the compound NSC648059 (1) has a low micromolar inhibitory, activity (IC50=0.8-2.0 μM) against Escherichia coli topoisomerase I. Structurally, 1 is a fluoroquinophenzoxazine derivative with a unique planar tetracyclic ring system, belonging to a member of an extended chemical class of fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In the clinic, fluoroquinolones including norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin (FIG. 1) represent some of the most successful antibiotic classes, whose mechanisms of action are to inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV as well as relaxation of supercoiled DNA and thus to promote breakage of double-stranded DNA [29]. Specifically, fluoroquinophenoxazines such as A-62176 and A-85226 (FIG. 1) have been reported as antibacterial [30, 31] and anticancer [32-35] agents. For example, A-62176 exhibited good activity against several cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 0.87-4.34 μM [32].

9-amino-5, 6-difluoro-3-oxo-3H-pyrido[3,2,1-kl] phenoxazine-2-carboxylic acid (1) was synthesized and its biochemical activity tested against E. coli topoisomerase I. Resynthesized fluoroquinophenoxazine hit 1 showed reproducible topoisomerase I inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 1.95 μM. The synthesis of 1 is shown in Scheme 1 (FIG. 2).
Briefly, commercially available 2,3-difluoro-6-nitrophenol was hydrogenated using Pd/C (20 mol %) as the catalyst to the corresponding amino product 2, which can be used in next step without further purification. Subsequent reaction of the aniline derivative 2 with diethyl 2-(ethoxymethylene)malonate under ambient temperature gave 3 in 87% yield. For next nucleophilic displacement cyclization, an improved protocol was developed for this intramolecular cyclization reaction under microwave irradiation at 250° C. instead of conventional heating [30].
Following simple filtration, 4 was obtained in 80% yield. Subsequently, 4 reacted with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (5a) in DMF at 100° C. to give the desired tetracyclic product 6a in 57% yield. Upon treatment of 6a in acidic condition (AcOH/HCl) under reflux for 4 h, the free carboxylic acid derivative 7a was obtained by simple filtration in 91% yield. Finally, hydrogenation of 7a under H2 (1.0 bar) using FeSO4.6H2O as the catalyst failed to yield the amine product 1 after 14 h. However, when SnCl2 was used as catalyst and AcOH as the solvent, the nitro group was smoothly reduced into the amino group under reflux for 3 h and the final product 1 was obtained in 86% yield.
Under the optimized conditions, the structural diversity of 1 was expended to evaluate the effect of various substituents on the quinophenoxazine skeleton and to explore their structure-activity relationship (SAR). First, we used various substrates 5b-e in Scheme 2 in an effort to generate a focused set of quinophenoxazine derivatives 7b-e. It is worthwhile noting that a dramatic difference was observed in terms of the reactivity of the substrate 5 with different electronic and/or physiochemical properties. For example, 5b bearing an electron-withdrawing nitrile group facilitated the completion of cyclization in 2 h and 6b was obtained in 59% yield. On the other hand, 5c with the lipophilic trifluoromethyl group could finish the reaction by extending the reaction time, affording the desired product 6c in a lower yield (10%). In addition, when the substrate 5d with an acetyl group was tried, 6d was obtained in 38% yield. However, for the substrate with the corresponding fluorine substitution, no reaction occurred even when the reaction temperature was raised to 120° C. Furthermore, more harsh conditions were tried in an attempt to facilitate the reaction by heating the reaction to 160° C. in a sealed pressure tube or heating the reaction to 200° C. under microwave irradiation, but with not much success. In the case of 5e with additional nitro and chlorine substituents, the reaction proceeded smoothly and 6e was obtained in 40% yield. Final ester hydrolysis was performed in acetic acid/hydrochloric acid under reflux, affording free carboxylic acid products 7b-e in 36-95% yields.
In the course of antibacterial evaluation, compound 1 lost 2-4 fold whole cell antibacterial activity after 4 weeks of storage, indicating that 1 may have stability and/or solubility issues. From 1H NMR experiments, it was noted that 1 could be easily precipitated out in d6-DMSO solvent and no degradation-related evidence was observed following several weeks of monitoring 1 in both d6-DMSO NMR and HPLC experiments (data not shown). Thus, to enhance the overall solubility profile of this class of quinophenoxazine derivatives, a variety of solubilizing and polar groups were introduced into the fluoroquinophenoxazine scaffold by displacing the 6-fluorine atom of 6a, 7a, or 1 with different amine functionalities such as piperazine, 1-methylpiperazine, and morpholine (Scheme 3).
Specifically, 6a reacted with 1-methylpiperazine in pyridine at 110° C. to give 9 in 53% yield. Accordingly, 7a reacted with 1-methylpiperazine and piperazine in pyridine under nitrogen atmosphere at 90° C., and both reactions proceeded smoothly to afford 10a and 10b in 45% and 84% yields, respectively [31].
In the cases of 1 and some other amine substrates, notably, reaction temperature appeared to play a critical role in this nucleophilic displacement reaction. For example, when morpholine was used as a nucleophile, the reaction became complicated under 90° C., which is suitable for 1-methylpiperazine and piperazine. In contrast, when temperature was reduced to 70° C., the reaction could be completed in 16 h to produce 11d in 71% yield. Other functional amines were also subjected to this substitution reaction, and most of the reactions could lead to the desired products 11c-k under 90° C. in moderate yields except for 1-adamantylamine.
The reaction of 1 with 1-adamantylamine could finish under reflux after 4 days in 29% yield, presumably due to steric effect. In addition, to investigate the effect of the free amine functionality of 1 on topoisomerase inhibition and antibacterial activity, we next tried to protect the free amino group with acetyl functionality. The N-acetyl derivative 12 was synthesized from 1 and acetic anhydride in pyridine at 80-100° C. and the solid product was collected by simple filtration in high yield (92%).
Finally, to evaluate the potential stereospecific effect at the 6 position of fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives on biological activity, we designed and synthesized several chiral fluoroquinophenoxazine amine derivatives from 6a or 1 and chiral amine building blocks [31, 32_ENREF_13]._ENREF_6 The nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1 and (S)-3-(Boc-amino)pyrrolidine (13a) in pyridine was completed in 20 h, affording 15a in 86% yield. Subsequent N-Boc deprotection of 15a produced 17a in 78% yield upon the treatment with diluted hydrochloric acid. With regard to the reaction of 1 and the corresponding (R)-3-(Boc-amino)pyrrolidine (13b), the substituted compound 15b could not be obtained by filtration upon the completion of reaction. Therefore, the crude product 15b was used for the following deprotection reaction and the corresponding fluorophenoxazine derivative 17b (R) was obtained in 48% yield over two steps. Accordingly, compound 16 was synthesized from 6a as the starting material in 32% yield over two steps (Scheme 4).
Example 3-Inhibition of E. coli Topoisomerase I Relaxation Activity
Recombinant E. coli topoisomerase I and gyrase expressed in E. coli were purified as described previously [36, 37].
All the synthesized target molecules were tested for the ability to inhibit the relaxation activity of E. coli topoisomerase I in target-based assay, as well as against a panel of bacterial strains including the wild-type E. coli MG1655 K12 strain, E. coli strain BAS3023 with imp mutation conferring membrane permeability to small molecules [38, 39], the wild-type Gram-positive B. subtilis (ATCC 6633) strain, and M. tuberculosis (H37Rv). The results are summarized in Table 1.
E. coli Topoisomerase I Relaxation Activity Inhibition Assay
The relaxation activity of E. coli topoisomerase I was assayed in a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/mL gelatin, and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Half microliter from the appropriate stock solutions of compounds dissolved in the solvent (DMSO) or the solvent alone (control) was mixed with 9.5 μL of the reaction buffer containing 10 ng of enzyme before the addition of 10 μL of reaction buffer containing 200 ng of supercoiled pBAD/Thio plasmid DNA purified by cesium chloride gradient as substrate. Following incubation at 37° C. for 30 min, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 4 μL of a stop buffer (50% glycerol, 50 mM EDTA, and 0.5% (v/v) bromophenol blue), and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained in ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light.
E. coli Topoisomerase I Inhibition
Biochemical evaluation for inhibition of the relaxation activity of E. coli topoisomerase I revealed that the majority of our synthesized compounds possessed good activity against E. coli topoisomerase I. On the basis of these topoisomerase I inhibition data (Table 1), The 9 position substituent plays a very important role in topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. Among the 5,6-difluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives, the hit compound 1 with the electron-donating 9-NH2 group showed the most potent activity (IC50=1.95 μM) against E. coli topoisomerase I. Both free carboxylic acid 7c and its ethyl ester derivative 6c with the 9-CF3 functionality were inactive against topoisomerase I when tested at 125 μM. In addition, compared to 1 (9-NH2, 1.95 μM), all the other 5,6-difluoro derivatives with 9-substituted electron-withdrawing groups (7a with 9-NO2, 15.6 μM; 7b with 9-CN, 31.25 μM; 7d with 9-Ac, 15.6 μM; 7e with 9-NO2 and 10-Cl, 31.25 μM) were 8-16 fold less active with IC50 values ranging from 15.6-31.25 μM. Thus, the topoisomerase I inhibitory activity among these derivative is 1>7a, 7d>7b, 7e.
In general, the basic amine functionality at the 6 position significantly enhanced topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. For example, the 6-substituted amine derivatives 11a with 6-methylpiperazinyl, 11b with piperazinyl, 11d with morpholino, 11g with bipiperidinyl, 11h with morpholinoethyl, as well as the 6-substituted aminopyrrolidinyl derivatives 16, 17a, and 17b demonstrated the most potent topoisomerase I inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.24-0.97 μM; and within this group, 11d and 11h with the morpholino group had an IC50 value of 0.97 μM. In contrast, all the other 6-substituted amine derivatives with a more lipophilic side chain, including 11c with methylpiperidinyl, 11e with phenethyl, 11f with adamantanyl, 11i with cyclohexyl, 11j with cyclopentyl, 11k with n-hexyl, and 15a with t-Boc-aminopyrrolidinyl, showed weaker topoisomerase I inhibition with IC50 values ranging from 3.9 to 15.6 μM. Notably, both 6-substituted aminopyrrolidinyl S- and R-stereoisomers 17a and 17b exhibited the same topoisomerase I inhibitory activity (IC50=0.48-0.97 μM), suggesting the stereochemistry at the 6 position is not required for topoisomerase I inhibition, iii) Esterification of the carboxylic acid group had little effect on the E. coli topoisomerase I inhibitory activity by comparing 6a and 7a (IC50=15.6 μM), 6b and 7b (IC50=31.25 μM), as well as 6c and 7c (IC50>125 μM), indicating the ethyl ester functionality is tolerated for topoisomerase I enzyme inhibition. Representative inhibition results of 11a and 11b against E. coli topoisomerase relaxation activity are shown in FIG. 6.

Example 4- Selectivity and Specificity Against Other DNA Topoisomerase Enzymes
DNA Gyrase Supercoiling Inhibition Assay
DNA gyrase supercoiling assays were carried out by mixing the compounds and the enzyme in a similar manner as above (EcTopI relaxation inhibition assay) but in a gyrase assay buffer (35 mM Tris-HCl, 24 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 1.75 mM ATP, 5 mM spermidine, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 6.5% glycerol at pH 7.5), followed by the addition of 300 ng of relaxed covalently closed circular DNA (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass., USA) to a final reaction volume of 20 μL. The samples were incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes before being terminated by the addition of a buffer containing 5% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol blue, and 25% glycerol. The reactions were then analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Human Topoisomerase I Relaxation Inhibition Assay
Human topoisomerase I relaxation assays were carried out with 0.5 U of enzyme in reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The enzyme was mixed with the indicated concentration of compound dissolved before 200 ng of supercoiled pBAD/Thio plasmid DNA was added in the same buffer, for a final volume of 20 μL. Following incubation at 37° C. for 30 minutes, the reactions were terminated with a buffer containing 5% SDS, 0.25% bromophenol blue, and 25% glycerol, and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Human topoisomerase I and topoisomerase IIα were purchased from TopoGen (Buena vista, CO, USA).
Human Topoisomerase IIα Decatenation Inhibition Assay
Human Topoisomerase IIα assays were carried out by adding the compounds to 185 ng of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA, from TopoGen) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer before the addition of 2 U of the enzyme. The samples were incubated for 15 minutes at 37° C. before the addition of 4 μL of a stop buffer containing 5% sarkosyl, 0.25% bromophenol blue, and 25% glycerol. The reactions were then analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels containing 0.5 g/mL ethidium bromide before being photographed under UV light.
Selectivity and specificity against other DNA topoisomerase enzymes
In addition, to determine the selectivity and specificity profiles of this class of fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives, selected compounds were also investigated for the ability to inhibit other DNA topoisomerases including E. coli DNA gyrase as well as human topoisomerase I and IIα enzymes.
Overall, these compounds were more selective toward E. coli topoisomerase I than other enzymes tested. Given that this series of compounds has close structural similarity to quinolone antibiotic class, as such, inhibition against E. coli gyrase can be also observed. Specifically, most of the compounds showed 4-64 fold selectivity toward topoisomerase I over DNA gyrase except that the moderately active compound 7e with the 9-NO2 and 10-chloro substituents showed less specificity with 2 fold selectivity toward topoisomerase I. With respect to human topoisomerases I and IIα inhibition, these compounds also showed inhibitory activity against both human topoisomerase I (IC50=3.9-31.25 μM) and topoisomerase IIα (IC50=0.97-250 μM), with approximate 4-32 fold selectivity. Taken together, compounds 11a (IC50=0.48 μM) and 11b (IC50=0.24 μM) (FIG. 6) bearing both 9-NH2 and 6-piperazinyl motifs exhibited the most potent topoisomerase I inhibitory activity with the more favorable selectivity profile (8-64 fold) toward E. coli topoisomerase I against all the other enzymes tested.
Example 5-Cell-Based Assays
The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were determined against E. coli and B. subtilis in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton Broth according to standard microdilution protocol [40].
MICs of compounds against M. tuberculosis were determined by a modified microplate Alamar blue assay (MABA) [41]. Vero cell cytotoxicity assay was performed as previously described [41].
Cell-Based Antibacterial Activity
In addition to target-based topoisomerase enzyme inhibition, whole cell antibacterial activities of the synthesized compounds were also assessed against a panel of bacterial strains. The results are also shown in Table 1. From these data, the majority of these fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives exhibited good to excellent antibacterial activity against the membrane permeable E. coli strain BAS3023 and Gram-positive B. subtilis strain, and were inactive against the wide type E. coli strain. Additionally, the antibacterial activity of most fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives (e.g., 1, 7a, 7c, 9, 10a, 11a-d, 11f-i, 15a, 16, and 17a-b) generally correlated with E. coli topoisomerase I inhibitory activity, suggesting that the antibacterial basis of these compounds may be in part due to the inhibition of topoisomerase I. The only type IA topoisomerase present in M. tuberculosis has recently been validated as an antitubercular target [42]. The topoisomerase I activity has been shown to be essential for viability and infection in a murine model of tuberculosis [42, 43]. To further determine the antituberculosis profile for this chemical class of fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives, twelve compounds were selected and evaluated against M. tuberculosis. Among them, 11g with the 6-bipiperidinyl lipophilic side chain and 11d with the 6-morpholino heterocyclic ring system showed the most potent antituberculosis activity with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 2.5 and 3.5 μM, respectively. In addition, compared to 11d, its corresponding 6-piperazinyl structural analogs 11a with tertiary amine and 11b with secondary amine functionality was about 2- and 8-fold less active with the MIC values of 7.6 and 29.5 μM, respectively. In contrast, both 6-substituted aminopyrrolidinyl derivatives 17a (S) and 17b (R) with primary amine functionality were not active (MIC>63.1 μM) against M. tuberculosis.
These data strongly suggest that the decreased or lost whole cell antituberculosis activity of these compounds are most likely due to their decreased lipophilicity and subsequent cell membrane penetration. Unfortunately, cytotoxicity evaluation of our tested compounds against healthy normal Vero cells showed that they generally had narrow selectivity index, with 11g (SI=9.8) being the most promising compound. It is also worthwhile noting that, one of the most potent topoisomerase I inhibitors, 11a (IC50=0.48 μM) bearing the 6-methylpiperazinyl and 9-amino motifs, showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria strains with MICs ranging from 0.78 to 7.6 μM (SI=3.8-37).

Viability of the mycobacteria mycobacterium smegmatis in biofilm was measured by the resazurin assay. Compound 11g at 1.5-3 μM can abolish 90% of viability, versus 24 μM or higher required for ciprofloxacin to achieve the same anti-biofilm activity.
The resazurin assay is a quick method using the resazurin dye as a bacterial respiration indicator to assay the antibacterial activity of various compounds used against bacterial biofilm growth. Such assay is well-known in the art. Resazurin was used to measure the presence of active biofilm bacteria, after adding the compound, in relation to a standard curve generated from inocula in suspension of the same organism used to grow the biofilm. The biofilm was quantified indirectly by measuring the fluorescent, water-soluble resorufin product produced when resazurin is reduced by reactions associated with respiration.
Example 6-CoMFA Modeling
Dataset
All the synthesized and tested fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives were used for CoMFA study. The topoisomerase I inhibitory activity (IC50, μM) from biochemical enzyme assay was converted to pIC50 values for correlation purpose (pIC50=−log IC50). The total compound set is divided into two subsets: a training set of 21 compounds for generating 3D-quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models and a test set of 7 compounds for validating the quality of the model (Table 3). The compound selections of training and test sets were done manually so that compounds ranging from weak, moderate, to strong topoisomerase I inhibitory activities were present in both sets and were in approximately equal proportions.
Conformational Model Analysis and Molecular Alignment
In the 3D-QSAR studies, alignment rule and biological conformation selection are two important factors to construct reliable models. For both training and test set molecules, conformational models representing their available conformational space were calculated. All the molecules were subjected to produce a maximum of 255 conformations within 20 kcal/mol in energy from global minimum. Due to the relatively rigid structural feature of these molecules, the core structure of quinophenoxazine was used for the alignment.
CoMFA Model Generation
CoMFA was performed using the QSAR module of SYBYL-X [44]. The steric and electrostatic field energies were calculated using the Lennard-Jones and the Coulomb potentials, respectively, with a 1/r distance-dependent dielectric constant in all intersections of a regularly spaced (0.2 nm) grid. The electrostatic fields were computed using Gasteiger-Huckel charge calculation methods. A sp3 hybridized carbon atom with a radius of 1.53 Å and a charge of +1.0 was used as a probe to calculate the steric and electrostatic energies between the probe and the molecules using the Tripos force field. The standard parameters implemented in SYBYL-X were used. The truncation for both steric and electrostatic energies was set to 30 kcal/mol.
Partial Least Square (PLS) Analysis
PLS methodology [45] was used for 3D-QSAR analysis. The cross-validation analysis [46, 47] was performed using the leave one out (LOO) methods in which one compound is removed from the dataset and its activity is then predicted using the model derived from the rest of the dataset. The cross validated r2 that resulted in the optimum number of components and the lowest standard error of prediction were considered for further analysis. To speed up the analysis and reduce noise, a minimum filter value of 2.00 kcal/mol was used. A final analysis was performed to calculate conventional r2 using the optimum number of components obtained from the cross-validation analysis.
CoMFA Analysis
To further understand the structural basis for topoisomerase I inhibitory activity of this set of fluoroquinophenoxazine derivatives, we subsequently performed three dimensional QSAR (3D-QSAR) study using CoMFA analysis [48_ENREF_23]. Because of the relatively rigid core structural feature of this class of fluoroquinophenoxazine molecules, we directly applied core structure based alignment to build reliable 3D-QSAR models. The CoMFA study was carried out using a total of 21 compounds (entries 1-21, Table 3). Statistical parameters of the CoMFA model showed a reasonable cross-validated correlation coefficient q2 of 0.688, indicating a good internal prediction of the model. The CoMFA model also exhibited a conventional correlation coefficient r2 of 0.806. To evaluate the predictive ability of our developed model, a test set of 7 compounds (entries 22-28, Table 3) which was not included in model generation was subsequently used. The predicative correlation coefficient r2pred of 0.767 indicates good external predicative ability of the CoMFA model. The experimental and predicted values as well as their residuals from the training and test set molecules are listed in Table 3. The correlation between the predicted and experimental values of all compounds was plotted and the resulting chart is shown in FIG. 7.

The results of the CoMFA model were analyzed and visualized using the standard deviation coefficient (StDev*Coeff) mapping option contoured by steric and electrostatic contributions. In order to probe the structure/activity correlation, the steric and electrostatic contours were mapped onto their aligned chemical structures of these fluoroquinophenoxazine molecules to identify the potential regions in which the molecules would favorably or unfavorably interact with the topoisomerase I enzyme. The representative steric and electrostatic contour maps of the most active compound 11b and the least active 6c derived from the CoMFA model are shown in FIG. 5. Briefly, the yellow areas in the steric contour maps indicate regions of steric hindrance to activity, while the green areas indicating steric contribution to potency. From the electrostatic contour maps, the regions in blue indicate positive electrostatic charge potential associated with increased activity, with the red regions show electronegative groups with increased activity.
In FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B, one green contour was found near the piperazinyl moiety of compound 11b indicating that a moderate steric substituent would be favored at the 6 position of the quinophenoxazine scaffold. This may offer a potential explanation why the 6-substituted amino derivatives were generally more active than the 6-fluoro analogs. In addition, two yellow contours were observed near the 9 position of inactive 6c, indicating that a steric bulkiness (e.g., NO2 in 6a and 7a, CF3 in 6c, and the acetyl group in 7d) would be disfavored for activity in this area.
The CoMFA electrostatic contour maps are displayed in FIG. 8C and FIG. 8D. A large blue contour was found around the 9 position of compounds 11b and 6c, indicating that the presence of electron rich functionalities and positively charged environment at this position (e.g., NH2 vs. NO2, Ac, CN, and CF3) would be strongly favored for topoisomerase I inhibitory activity. It was also observed that a big red contour region was present around the 2 position of fluoroquinophenoxazine scaffold, suggesting that an electronegative group (e.g., COOH and COOR2) at this position may be required for activity. Finally, two red contours were found at both sides of the fused heterocyclic skeleton of 11b and 6c, suggesting that electron deficient functionalities would be favored in those regions.
