BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
The melanocortin system consists of five receptors, discovered to date, that are members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Chhajlani, V., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993, 195, 866-873; Chhajlani, V., et al. FEBS Lett. 1992, 309, 417-420; Gantz, I., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 8246-8250; Gantz, I., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1993, 268, 15174-15179; Gantz, I., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994, 200, 1214-1220; Griffon, N., et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994, 200, 1007-1014; Mountjoy, K. G., et al. Science 1992, 257, 1248-1251; and Roselli-Rehfuss, L., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993, 90, 8856-8860), endogenous agonists including the α-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), β-MSH, γ-MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) derived from the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene transcript (Nakanishi, S., et al. Nature 1979, 278, 423-427), and the naturally occurring antagonists agouti and agouti-related protein (AGRP) (Lu, D., et al. Nature 1994, 371, 799-802; 011mann, M. M., et al. Science 1997, 278, 135-138; and Yang, Y. K., et al. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999, 13, 148-155). These receptors and ligands are purported to be important in numerous biological pathways, including pigmentation (Allen, B. M. Science 1916, 44, 755-758; and Smith, P. E. Science 1916, 44, 280-282), steroidogenesis (Haynes, R. C., Jr., et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1957, 225, 115-124), and energy homeostasis (Huszar, D., et al. Cell 1997, 88, 131-141). In particular, knock-out of the melanocortin 3- and 4-receptors (MC3R, MC4R) in mice alters metabolic phenotypes, with MC3R deficient mice possessing normal body weight accompanied by an increase in fat mass, while disrupting the MC4R results in hyperphagia and obesity in mice (Huszar, D., et al. Cell 1997, 88, 131-141; Butler, A. A., et al. Endocrinol. 2000, 141, 3518-3521; and Chen, A. S., et al. Nat. Genet. 2000, 26, 97-102). Mutations in the MC4R in humans have also been shown to result in obesity; in one study, 5.8% of individuals with severe childhood obesity were found to have mutations in the MC4R (Farooqi, I. S., et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003, 348, 1085-1095). Mice may therefore serve as a translation model for MC4R-related obesity in humans due to the similar hyperphagic, overweight phenotype observed. Central administration of the nonselective melanocortin agonists α-MSH (Poggioli, R., et al. Peptides 1986, 7, 843-848), NDP-MSH (Brown, K. S., et al. Regul. Peptides 1998, 78, 89-94), and MT-II (Fan, W., et al. Nature 1997, 385, 165-168; and Irani, B. G., et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2011, 660, 80-87) through an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection decrease food intake in rodents, while injection of the synthetic SHU9119 (Fan, W., et al. Nature 1997, 385, 165-168) and endogenous AGRP (Irani, B. G., et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2011, 660, 80-87; and Ebihara, K., et al. Diabetes 1999, 48, 2028-2033) MC3R/MC4R antagonists increase food consumption. With estimated global obesity rates more than doubling from 1980 to 2014 (World Health Organization (2016) Obesity and overweight fact sheet), the development of novel probes to investigate the etiology of obesity and serve as potential therapeutic leads may be important in efforts to decrease this trend. While MC4R-selective agonists based upon the endogenous melanocortin agonists have previously been investigated, off-target effects including increased blood pressure and increased erectile activity have limited their clinical utility (Greenfield, J. R., et al. New Engl. J. Med. 2009, 360, 44-52). Therefore, there is a need for new melanocortin ligands. Specifically, there is a need for MC4-R ligands (e.g., selective MC4-R ligands) with less undesired side effects.

Administration
Compounds of formula (I) (including salts and prodrugs thereof) can be formulated as pharmaceutical compositions and administered to a mammalian host, such as a human patient in a variety of forms adapted to the chosen route of administration, i.e., orally or parenterally, by intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, topical, nasal, inhalation, suppository, sub dermal osmotic pump, or subcutaneous routes.
Thus, the present compounds may be systemically administered, e.g., orally, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle such as an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier. They may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, may be compressed into tablets, or may be incorporated directly with the food of the patient's diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compound may be combined with one or more excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1% of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 to about 60% of the weight of a given unit dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage level will be obtained.
The tablets, troches, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain the following: binders such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, fructose, lactose or aspartame or a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring may be added. When the unit dosage form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier, such as a vegetable oil or a polyethylene glycol. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the solid unit dosage form. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with gelatin, wax, shellac or sugar and the like. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose or fructose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Of course, any material used in preparing any unit dosage form should be pharmaceutically acceptable and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compound may be incorporated into sustained-release preparations and devices.
The active compound may also be administered intravenously, intrathecally or intraperitoneally by infusion or injection. Solutions of the active compound or its salts can be prepared in water, optionally mixed with a nontoxic surfactant. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, triacetin, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.
The pharmaceutical dosage forms suitable for injection or infusion can include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions or sterile powders comprising the active ingredient which are adapted for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable or infusible solutions or dispersions, optionally encapsulated in liposomes. In all cases, the ultimate dosage form should be sterile, fluid and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The liquid carrier or vehicle can be a solvent or liquid dispersion medium comprising, for example, water, ethanol, a polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and the like), vegetable oils, nontoxic glyceryl esters, and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the formation of liposomes, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, buffers or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filter sterilization. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying techniques, which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient present in the previously sterile-filtered solutions.
For topical administration, the present compounds may be applied in pure form, i.e., when they are liquids. However, it will generally be desirable to administer them to the skin as compositions or formulations, in combination with a dermatologically acceptable carrier, which may be a solid or a liquid.
Useful solid carriers include finely divided solids such as talc, clay, microcrystalline cellulose, silica, alumina and the like. Useful liquid carriers include water, alcohols or glycols or water-alcohol/glycol blends, in which the present compounds can be dissolved or dispersed at effective levels, optionally with the aid of non-toxic surfactants. Adjuvants such as fragrances and additional antimicrobial agents can be added to optimize the properties for a given use. The resultant liquid compositions can be applied from absorbent pads, used to impregnate bandages and other dressings, or sprayed onto the affected area using pump-type or aerosol sprayers.
Thickeners such as synthetic polymers, fatty acids, fatty acid salts and esters, fatty alcohols, modified celluloses or modified mineral materials can also be employed with liquid carriers to form spreadable pastes, gels, ointments, soaps, and the like, for application directly to the skin of the user.
Examples of useful dermatological compositions which can be used to deliver the compounds of formula I to the skin are known to the art; for example, see Jacquet et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,608,392), Geria (U.S. Pat. No. 4,992,478), Smith et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,559,157) and Wortzman (U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,508).
Useful dosages of the compound of formula (I) can be determined by comparing their in vitro activity, and in vivo activity in animal models. Methods for the extrapolation of effective dosages in mice, and other animals, to humans are known to the art; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 4,938,949.
The amount of the compound, or an active salt or derivative thereof, required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular salt selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician.
In general, however, a suitable dose will be in the range of from about 0.5 to about 100 mg/kg, e.g., from about 10 to about 75 mg/kg of body weight per day, such as 3 to about 50 mg per kilogram body weight of the recipient per day, preferably in the range of 6 to 90 mg/kg/day, most preferably in the range of 15 to 60 mg/kg/day.
The compound is conveniently formulated in unit dosage form; for example, containing 5 to 1000 mg, conveniently 10 to 750 mg, most conveniently, 50 to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of the invention formulated in such a unit dosage form.
The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, e.g., into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations; such as multiple inhalations from an insufflator or by application of a plurality of drops into the eye.
Compounds of the invention can also be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents. For example, compounds of formula (I), or salts thereof, may be administered with other agents that are useful for modulating appetite (i.e., increasing or decreasing), modulating metabolic activity, treating obesity or diseases associated with obesity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease or hypertension), inducing weight loss, increasing or decreasing weight gain. Accordingly, in one embodiment the invention also provides a composition comprising a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, at least one other therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention also provides a kit comprising compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, at least one other therapeutic agent, packaging material, and instructions for administering the compound of formula (I) or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the other therapeutic agent or agents to an animal to modulate appetite, modulate metabolic activity, treat obesity or diseases associated with obesity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease or hypertension), induce weight loss, increase weight gain, or decrease weight gain.

The term also comprises natural and unnatural amino acids bearing a conventional amino protecting group (e.g. acetyl or benzyloxycarbonyl), as well as natural and unnatural amino acids protected at the carboxy terminus (e.g. as a (C1-C6)alkyl, phenyl or benzyl ester or amide; or as an a-methylbenzyl amide). Other suitable amino and carboxy protecting groups are known to those skilled in the art (See for example, T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis; Wiley: New York, 1981, and references cited therein). An amino acid can be linked to the remainder of a compound of formula I through the carboxy terminus, the amino terminus, or through any other convenient point of attachment, such as, for example, through the sulfur of cysteine.
The term “peptide” describes a sequence of 2 to 25 amino acids (e.g. as defined hereinabove) or peptidyl residues. The sequence may be linear or cyclic. For example, a cyclic peptide can be prepared or may result from the formation of amide bonds or disulfide bridges between two cysteine residues in a sequence. When a peptide is cyclic, it can be illustrated as “c[peptide sequence]”. A peptide can be linked to the remainder of a compound of formula I through the carboxy terminus, the amino terminus, or through any other convenient point of attachment, such as, for example, through the sulfur of a cysteine. In certain embodiments, a peptide comprises 3 to 10, or 4 to 8 amino acids. In certain embodiments, a peptide comprises 5 to 13 amino acids, or 5 to 9 amino acids. In certain embodiments, a compound of formula I comprises between about 5 to about 29 amino acid residues. Peptide derivatives can be prepared as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,612,302; 4,853,371; and 4,684,620, or as described in the Examples hereinbelow. Peptide sequences specifically recited herein are written with the amino terminus on the left and the carboxy terminus on the right. The term “dipeptide” refers to a peptide comprising two amino acids joined through an amide bond. The term “tripeptide” means a peptide comprising three amino acids joined through two amide bonds. The terms “protein,” “peptide” and “polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein.
As used herein, the term “residue of an amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide” means a portion of an amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide. For example, variables X1, X2, X3 and X4 may be residues of an amino acid, dipeptide or tripeptide, wherein certain atoms (e.g., H or OH) have been removed to link the amino acids via a peptide bond.
The following terms are used to describe the sequence relationships between two or more sequences (e.g., polypeptides): (a) “reference sequence,” (b) “comparison window,” (c) “sequence identity,” (d) “percentage of sequence identity,” and (e) “substantial identity.”
(a) As used herein, “reference sequence” is a defined sequence used as a basis for sequence comparison. A reference sequence may be a subset or the entirety of a specified sequence; for example, as a segment of a full length peptide sequence or the complete peptide sequence.
(b) As used herein, “comparison window” makes reference to a contiguous and specified segment of a sequence, wherein the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. Generally, the comparison window is at least 20 contiguous nucleotides in length, and optionally can be 30, 40, 50, 100, or longer. Those of skill in the art understand that to avoid a high similarity to a reference sequence due to inclusion of gaps in the sequence a gap penalty is typically introduced and is subtracted from the number of matches.
Methods of alignment of sequences for comparison are well known in the art. Thus, the determination of percent identity between any two sequences can be accomplished using a mathematical algorithm. Non-limiting examples of such mathematical algorithms are the algorithm of Myers and Miller (1988) CABIOS, 4:11; the local homology algorithm of Smith et al. (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482; the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, (1970) JMB, 48:443; the search-for-similarity-method of Pearson and Lipman, (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:2444; the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul, (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 87:2264, modified as in Karlin and Altschul, (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 90:5873.
Computer implementations of these mathematical algorithms can be utilized for comparison of sequences to determine sequence identity. Such implementations include, but are not limited to: CLUSTAL in the PC/Gene program (available from Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.); the ALIGN program (Version 2.0) and GAP, BESTFIT, BLAST, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Version 8 (available from Genetics Computer Group (GCG), 575 Science Drive, Madison, Wis., USA). Alignments using these programs can be performed using the default parameters. The CLUSTAL program is well described by Higgins et al. (1988) Gene 73:237; Higgins et al. (1989) CABIOS 5:151; Corpet et al. (1988) Nucl. Acids Res. 16:10881; Huang et al. (1992) CABIOS 8:155; and Pearson et al. (1994) Meth. Mol. Biol. 24:307. The ALIGN program is based on the algorithm of Myers and Miller, supra. The BLAST programs of Altschul et al. (1990) JMB, 215:403; Nucl. Acids Res., 25:3389 (1990), are based on the algorithm of Karlin and Altschul supra.
Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (available on the world wide web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). This algorithm involves first identifying high scoring sequence pairs (HSPs) by identifying short words of length W in the query sequence, which either match or satisfy some positive-valued threshold score T when aligned with a word of the same length in a database sequence. T is referred to as the neighborhood word score threshold. These initial neighborhood word hits act as seeds for initiating searches to find longer HSPs containing them. The word hits are then extended in both directions along each sequence for as far as the cumulative alignment score can be increased. Cumulative scores are calculated using, for nucleotide sequences, the parameters M (reward score for a pair of matching residues; always >0) and N (penalty score for mismatching residues; always <0). For amino acid sequences, a scoring matrix is used to calculate the cumulative score. Extension of the word hits in each direction are halted when the cumulative alignment score falls off by the quantity X from its maximum achieved value, the cumulative score goes to zero or below due to the accumulation of one or more negative-scoring residue alignments, or the end of either sequence is reached.
In addition to calculating percent sequence identity, the BLAST algorithm also performs a statistical analysis of the similarity between two sequences. One measure of similarity provided by the BLAST algorithm is the smallest sum probability (P(N)), which provides an indication of the probability by which a match between two nucleotide or amino acid sequences would occur by chance. For example, a test nucleic acid sequence is considered similar to a reference sequence if the smallest sum probability in a comparison of the test nucleic acid sequence to the reference nucleic acid sequence is less than about 0.1, more preferably less than about 0.01, and most preferably less than about 0.001.
To obtain gapped alignments for comparison purposes, Gapped BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be utilized as described in Altschul et al. (1997) Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389. Alternatively, PSI-BLAST (in BLAST 2.0) can be used to perform an iterated search that detects distant relationships between molecules. See Altschul et al., supra. When utilizing BLAST, Gapped BLAST, PSI-BLAST, the default parameters of the respective programs (e.g., BLASTN for nucleotide sequences, BLASTX for proteins) can be used. The BLASTN program (for nucleotide sequences) uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 11, an expectation (E) of 10, a cutoff of 100, M=5, N=−4, and a comparison of both strands. For amino acid sequences, the BLASTP program uses as defaults a wordlength (W) of 3, an expectation (E) of 10, and the BLOSUM62 scoring matrix. See the world wide web at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Alignment may also be performed manually by visual inspection.
For purposes of the present invention, comparison of sequences for determination of percent sequence identity to another sequence may be made using the BlastN program (version 1.4.7 or later) with its default parameters or any equivalent program. By “equivalent program” is intended any sequence comparison program that, for any two sequences in question, generates an alignment having identical nucleotide or amino acid residue matches and an identical percent sequence identity when compared to the corresponding alignment generated by the preferred program.
(c) As used herein, “sequence identity” or “identity” in the context of two polypeptide sequences makes reference to a specified percentage of residues in the two sequences that are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window, as measured by sequence comparison algorithms or by visual inspection. When percentage of sequence identity is used in reference to proteins it is recognized that residue positions which are not identical often differ by conservative amino acid substitutions, where amino acid residues are substituted for other amino acid residues with similar chemical properties (e.g., charge or hydrophobicity) and therefore do not change the functional properties of the molecule. When sequences differ in conservative substitutions, the percent sequence identity may be adjusted upwards to correct for the conservative nature of the substitution. Sequences that differ by such conservative substitutions are said to have “sequence similarity” or “similarity.” Means for making this adjustment are well known to those of skill in the art. Typically, this involves scoring a conservative substitution as a partial rather than a full mismatch, thereby increasing the percentage sequence identity. Thus, for example, where an identical amino acid is given a score of 1 and a non-conservative substitution is given a score of zero, a conservative substitution is given a score between zero and 1. The scoring of conservative substitutions is calculated, e.g., as implemented in the program PC/GENE (Intelligenetics, Mountain View, Calif.).
(d) As used herein, “percentage of sequence identity” means the value determined by comparing two optimally aligned sequences over a comparison window, wherein the portion of the sequence in the comparison window may comprise additions or deletions (i.e., gaps) as compared to the reference sequence (which does not comprise additions or deletions) for optimal alignment of the two sequences. The percentage is calculated by determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid base or amino acid residue occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions, dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions in the window of comparison, and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percentage of sequence identity.
(e)(i) The term “substantial identity” in the context of a peptide indicates that a peptide comprises a sequence with at least 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, or 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, or 89%, at least 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, or 94%, or 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%, sequence identity to the reference sequence over a specified comparison window. Optimal alignment is conducted using the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970). An indication that two peptide sequences are substantially identical is that one peptide is immunologically reactive with antibodies raised against the second peptide. Thus, a peptide is substantially identical to a second peptide, for example, where the two peptides differ only by a conservative substitution.
For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters.
The terms “treat” and “treatment” refer to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures, wherein the object is to prevent or decrease an undesired physiological change or disorder, such as a metabolic disorder (e.g., obesity) or a disease associated with the metabolic disorder. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. “Treatment” can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. Those in need of treatment include those already with the condition or disorder as well as those prone to have the condition or disorder or those in which the condition or disorder is to be prevented.
The phrase “effective amount” means an amount of a compound of the present invention that (i) treats or prevents the particular disease, condition, or disorder, (ii) attenuates, ameliorates, or eliminates one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder, or (iii) prevents or delays the onset of one or more symptoms of the particular disease, condition, or disorder described herein.
The term “mammal” as used herein refers to, e.g., humans, higher non-human primates, rodents, domestic, cows, horses, pigs, sheep, dogs and cats. In one embodiment, the mammal is a human.
The invention will now be illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.
EXAMPLE 1
Design of Melanocortin Receptor Modulators
It has previously been demonstrated that the endogenous melanocortin antagonist AGRP may be converted into an agonist by select modifications. The full-length AGRP is 132 amino acids, though the highly structured C-terminal domain has been shown to be equipotent to the full-length protein (Ollmann, M. M., et al. Science 1997, 278, 135-138; and Yang, Y. K., et al. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999, 13, 148-155). An Arg-Phe-Phe tripeptide sequence critical for activity is located on an exposed β-hairpin loop within the 46-residue C-terminal domain (Bolin, K. A., et al. FEBS Lett. 1999, 451, 125-131; McNulty, J. C., et al. Biochemistry 2001, 40, 15520-15527; and Tota, M. R., et al. Biochemistry 1999, 38, 897-904). Further truncation of the C-terminal 12 amino acids and a Cys to Ala substitution has been shown to retain the β-hairpin loop with minimal loss in antagonist potency, resulting in “mini-AGRP” (Jackson, P. J., et al. Biochemistry 2002, 41, 7565-7572). Substitution of the potent melanocortin agonist His-DPhe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide sequence into the Arg-Phe-Phe residues of mini-AGRP resulted in the formation of a potent, nonselective melanocortin agonist, possessing nanomolar agonist potency at the MC4R (Jackson, P. J., et al. Peptides 2005, 26, 1978-1987; and Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207). The length, structural complexity, and relatively high synthetic cost of this chimeric peptide hindered additional structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. While further truncations beyond mini-AGRP traditionally result in diminished antagonist potencies, substitution of the His-DPhe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide into the Tyr-flanked, lactam-cyclized β-hairpin active loop of AGRP (Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2) resulted in a nonselective sub-nanomolar potent agonist at the MC1R, MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207; and Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075). Similar nanomolar to sub-nanomolar potencies were observed when a Tyr-flanked disulfide bridge was used to cyclize the active loop of AGRP (Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2) (Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390). Substitution of the Arg-Phe-Phe tripeptide into the DPhe-Arg-Trp sequence of NDP-MSH resulted in sub-micromolar agonist potencies, while the same replacement in MTII only resulted in partial receptor stimulation at the MC1R at concentrations up to 100 μM (Joseph, C. G., et al. Peptides 2003, 24, 1899-1908).
While truncation of AGRP classically results in diminished antagonist potency, one report demonstrated that the peptide c[Pro-Arg-Phe-Phe-Asn-Ala-Phe-DPro], the active loop of AGRP cyclized through a DPro-Pro motif, was only 50-fold less potent than AGRP(87-132) at the mMC4R despite the removal of 38 amino acids (Ericson, M. D., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58, 4638-4647). Further SAR studies demonstrated that replacement of the Asn with a Dap residue resulted in a cyclic octapeptide that was as potent an antagonist as AGRP at the MC4R, 160-fold selective for the MC4R over the MC3R, possessed minimal activity at the MC1R, and was unable to stimulate the MCSR at up to 100 μM concentrations (Ericson, M. D., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58, 4638-4647). Due to the prior reported activity of AGRP chimeric peptides, and the potency and selectivity of the Dap-containing octapeptide, it was hypothesized that incorporating the melanocortin agonist His-DPhe-Arg-Trp sequence into the octapeptide scaffold may result in a potent and MC4R-selective agonist. Furthermore, since this molecular scaffold is based upon the active loop of AGRP, it may be postulated that the resulting ligands may bypass the negative side effects of previously reported MC4R-selective compounds. In attempts to generate new potent, selective melanocortin agonists, a series of 14 cyclic peptides was synthesized and characterized at the mouse melanocortin receptors. The His-DPhe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide and DPhe-Arg-Trp tripeptide sequences were substituted for the Arg-Phe-Phe tripeptide in the DPro-Pro cyclized antagonist scaffold. Peptides containing either the native Asn residue or the more potent MC4R Dap substitution were examined for differences in potency and/or selectivity. Additionally, truncations of the non-pharmacophore Phe, Ala, and Asn/Dap amino acids were examined to explore the optimal size of the cyclic agonists and the importance of these residues.
EXAMPLE 2
Peptide Synthesis of Characterization
All peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc chemistry (Carpino, L. A., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970, 92, 5748-5749). Amino acids Fmoc-DPro, Fmoc-Phe, Fmoc-Ala, Fmoc-Asn(Trt), Fmoc-Trp(Boc), Fmoc-Arg(Pbf), Fmoc-DPhe, and Fmoc-His(Trt), H-Pro-2-chlorotrityl resin, and coupling reagents 2-(1-H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), and benzotriazol-1-yl-oxy-tris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) were purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, Ky.). Fmoc-Dap(Boc) was purchased from Peptides International and Bachem (Torrance, Calif.). Dichloromethane (DCM), methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (ACN), dimethylformamide (DMF), triflouroethanol (TFE), acetic acid, and anhydrous ethyl ether were purchased from Fisher (Fair Lawn, N.J.). Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), piperidine, triisopropylsilane (TIS), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Mo.). All reagents and chemicals were ACS grade or better and were used without further purification.
Peptides were synthesized on a 0.10 mmol scale using a H-Pro-2-Chlorotrityl resin (0.76 meq/g) with a manual microwave synthesizer (CEM Discover SPS). Syntheses consisted of two repeated steps: (i) removal of the Fmoc group with 20% piperidine (lx at rt for 2 min, 1× using microwave irradiation for 4 min at 75° C. with 30W), and (ii) single coupling of the incoming
Fmoc-protected amino acid (3 eq) with HBTU (3 eq) and DIPEA (5 eq) in DMF using microwave irradiation (75° C., 5 min, 30W). A lower temperature was utilized for His (50° C.) to avoid epimerization. The Arg coupling utilized more Arg (5 eq), HBTU (5 eq), and DIPEA (7 eq), and a longer irradiation time (10 min). After completion of the syntheses, peptides were cleaved with either a 99:1 DCM:TFA solution or 1:1:8 acetic acid:TFE:DCM solution. The cleavage solutions were then concentrated and side-chain protected peptides were precipitated using ice-cold ethyl ether. Peptides were cyclized in DCM with BOP (3 eq) and HOBt (3 eq) overnight, and the DCM was removed under vacuum. Without further purification, the cyclized peptides were side-chain deprotected using a 95:2.5:2.5 TFA:TIS:H2O solution for 2 hrs, the solution was then concentrated, and peptides precipitated using ice-cold ethyl ether.
Crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using a Shimadzu system with a photodiode array detector and a semi-preparative RP-HPLC C18 bonded silica column (Vydac 218TP1010, 1.0×2.5 cm). The peptides were at least 95% pure as assessed by analytical RP-HPLC in two diverse solvent systems and had the correct molecular weight by MALDI-MS (University of Minnesota Mass Spectrometry Lab) (Table 1).
Peptides were synthesized on a chlorotrityl resin to permit cleavage from the resin while retaining the side-chain protecting groups, necessary for the cyclization of the peptides without any terminal to side-chain cyclized byproducts. The syntheses were aided by microwave irradiation, which has previously been shown to prematurely cleave peptides from chlorotrityl resins (Echalier, C., et al. Amino Acids 2013, 45, 1395-1403). This was postulated to be due to direct thermal hydrolysis of the peptide from resin and was dependent on the amount of time the resin-bound peptide was exposed to elevated temperatures (Echalier, C., et al. Amino Acids 2013, 45, 1395-1403). The reported crude yields of 47.5-71.3% were similar to previous syntheses from the same H-Pro-chlorotrityl resin at room temperature (51.6-98.6%). It may be speculated that the relatively consistent yields may be a result of minimal time the peptide-resin was exposed to elevated temperatures (<10 min per coupling cycle) or the first amino acid (Pro) afforded some protection from premature cleavage.
EXAMPLE 3
Biological Evaluation
(1) cAMP AlphaScreen® Bioassay
Peptide ligands were dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 10' M and were pharmacological characterized using HEK293 cells stably expressing the mouse MC1R, MC3-5R by the cAMP AlphaScreen® assay (PerkinElmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as previously described (Ericson, M. D., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 5306-5308; Singh, A., et al. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 6, 568-572; and Tala, S. R., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 5708-5711).
Briefly, cells 70-90% confluent were dislodged with Versene (Gibco®) at 37° C. and plated 10,000 cells/well in a 384-well plate (Optiplate™) with 10 μL freshly prepared stimulation buffer (1× HBSS, 5 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM IBMX, 0.1% BSA, pH=7.4) with 0.5 μg anti-cAMP acceptor beads per well. The cells were stimulated with the addition of 5 μL stimulation buffer containing peptide (a seven point dose-response curve was used starting at 10−4 to 10−7 M, determined by ligand potency) or forskolin (10−4 M) and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 2 hr.
Following stimulation, streptavidin donor beads (0.5 μg) and biotinylated-cAMP (0.62 μmol) were added to the wells in a subdued light environment with 10 μL lysis buffer (5 mM HEPES, 0.3% Tween-20, 0.1% BSA, pH=7.4) and the plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for an additional 2 hr. Plates were read on a Enspire (PerkinElmer) Alpha-plate reader using a pre-normalized assay protocol (set by the manufacturer).
(2) Data Analysis
The EC50 values represent the mean of duplicate replicates performed in at least three independent experiments. The EC50 estimates and associated standard errors (SEM) were determined by fitting the data to a nonlinear least-squares analysis using the PRISM program (v4.0, GraphPad Inc.). The ligands were assayed as TFA salts and not corrected for peptide context.
(3) Results
The compounds were assayed for agonist activity using the AlphaScreen® cAMP assay using HEK293 cells stably transfected with the mouse melanocortin 1, 3, 4, and 5 receptors according to the manufacturer's instructions and as previously reported (Ericson, M. D., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 5306-5308; Singh, A., et al. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 6, 568-572; and Tala, S. R., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 5708-5711). The MC2R is only stimulated by ACTH and was therefore excluded from this study. The potent, nonselective melanocortin ligand NDP-MSH was used as a positive control (Sawyer, T. K., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980, 77, 5754-5758). Since the AlphaScreen® cAMP assay is a competition assay resulting in a lower signal at higher concentrations of ligand, concentration-activity curves were normalized to baseline and maximal NDP-MSH signal for illustrative purposes as previously described (Ericson, M. D., et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2015, 25, 5306-5308; and Elster, L., et al. J. Biomol. Screen. 2007, 12, 41-49). Due to the inherent error of the assay, compounds that were within a three-fold potency range were considered equipotent. Compounds that resulted in greater than 80% maximal NDP-MSH stimulation were considered to possess full agonist efficacy.
Table 2 summarizes the functional agonist pharmacology of the synthesized ligands. Substitution of the agonist His-DPhe-Arg-Trp sequence in the native antagonist loop in place of Arg-Phe-Phe resulted in compound MDES-149-2c, possessing 0.35, 32, 1.4, and 0.45 nM agonist potencies at the mMC1R, mMC3R, mMC4R, and mMC5R, respectively (Table 2, FIG. 1). Truncation of the Phe residue resulted in compound MDE6-3-2c and decreased agonist potency relative to MDE5-149-2c, with potency losses of 34-, 9-, 21-, and 5-fold at the mMC1R, mMC3R, mMC4R, and mMC5R. Removal of the Asn amino acid (MDE6-10-2c) further decreased agonist potency 143-, 121-, and 37-fold at the mMC1R, mMC4R and mMC5R, relative to MDE5-149-2c. Compound MDE6-10-2c was a partial agonist at the mMC3R and possessed 65% the maximal efficacy of NDP-MSH with an EC50 value of 510 nM.
Previously, it was shown that substitution of the Asn with a Dap residue could increase the antagonist potency of the resulting AGRP-derived octapeptide and resulted in a greater than 160-fold selectivity for the mMC4R over the mMC3R (Ericson, M. D., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58, 4638-4647). It was hypothesized that the same substitution with the agonist tetrapeptide His-DPhe-Arg-Trp sequence may create a potent and selective mMC4R agonist. This substitution was incorporated into peptide MDE5-151-2c, which possessed 24, 260, and 18 nM agonist potency at the mMC1R, mMC3R, and mMC5R. Compound MDE5-151-2c was a partial agonist at the mMC4R, possessed 70% of the maximal NDP-MSH response and 23 nM EC50 value at this receptor. In contrast to the Asn-containing MDE5-149-2c, removal of the Phe residue increased agonist potency (Table 2, FIGS. 1A-1D). Compound MDE6-5-2c was able to full stimulate the mMC4R (EC50=1.6 nM), and possessed 1.1, 40, and 0.3 nM agonist potency at the mMC1R, mMC3R, and mMC5R. At all receptors assayed, MDE6-5-2c was equipotent to MDES-149-2c (Table 2, FIGS. 1A-1D). Further truncation of the Ala residue (MDE6-12-2c) decreased agonist potency 418-, 593-, and 1,100-fold at the mMC1R, mMC4R, and mMC5R relative to MDE6-5-2c, and was able to stimulate the mMC3R to 65% of the maximal NDP-MSH response at concentrations up to 100 μM. Removal of the Asn/Dap position, resulting in the His-DPhe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide sequence cyclized through a DPro-Pro motif in hexapeptide MDES-147-2c, was able to partially stimulate the mMC3R and mMC4R relative to NDP-MSH (60% and 65% at 100 μM). This peptide also possessed 900 and 6,000 nM agonist EC50 values at the mMC1R and mMC5R, respectively.
It has previously been shown that the tripeptide Ac-DPhe-Arg-Trp-NH2 possesses micromolar agonist potency at the mMC1R, mMC4R, and mMC5R (Haskell-Luevano, C., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2001, 44, 2247-2252), and was the minimal fragment of NDP-MSH to possess agonist activity using the classic frog skin bioassay (Haskell-Luevano, C., et al. Peptides 1996, 17, 995-1002). In the native loop sequence of AGRP, an Arg-Phe-Phe tripeptide is postulated to be the active pharmacophore. It was hypothesized that insertion of the DPhe-Arg-Trp tripeptide into the DPro-Pro cyclized loop mimetics of AGRP may result in increased potency and/or selectivity in the resulting chimeric peptides, since this agonist sequence is the same length as the postulated antagonist active sequence and would not alter peptide length. Insertion of the DPhe-Arg-Trp tripeptide into the native, Asn-containing, loop sequence cyclized through DPro-Pro residues resulted in peptide MDE5-149-1c, which was unable to fully stimulate the mMC3R (45% of maximal NDP-MSH at 100 μM concentrations). This peptide was a weaker agonist relative to MDE5-149-2c, and possessed 400, 130, and 40 nM agonist potency at the mMC1R, mMC4R, and mMC5R, respectively (1140-, 90-, and 90-fold decreased potency relative to MDE5-149-2c). Similar potency was observed at all the melanocortin receptors when the Phe amino acid was removed, generating MDE6-3-1c. The removal of the Ala residue (MDE6-10-1c) resulted in increased agonist potency at the mMC1R (40 nM, 10-fold increase over MDE5-149-1c), and modest decreased signal at the mMC4R (1,100 nM, 8-fold decrease). Peptide MDE6-10-1c partially stimulated the mMC5R (25% of NDP-MSH) and showed no agonist activity at the mMC3R at concentrations up to 100 μM.
A similar trend of decreased agonist potency was observed when the DPhe-Arg-Trp was inserted into an AGRP active loop sequence where Asn was substituted with Dap (MDE5-151-1c). This compound was a partial agonist at the mMC1R and mMC3R (45% and 70% NDP-MSH maximum signal with EC50 values of 190 and 3,000 nM, respectively), and possessed 100 nM and 46 nM potency with full agonist efficacy at the mMC4R and mMC5R (FIGS. 1A-1D). Truncation of the Phe residue to generate MDE6-5-1c resulted in similar potency at the mMC4R (150 nM) and mMC5R (48 nM), full agonist efficacy at the mMC1R (600 nM), and partially stimulated the mMC3R (70% at 100 μM concentrations). Further removal of the Ala residue to generate the hexapeptide MDE6-12-1c decreased agonist potency at all receptors assayed, with no observable activity at the mMC3R or mMC5R at 100 μM concentrations (FIG. 1), 35% partial stimulation of the mMC4R (relative to NDP-MSH), and possessed partial agonist efficacy at the mMC1R (75% NDP-MSH, EC50=110 nM). Peptide MDE5-147-1c, the result of cyclizing the agonist tripeptide DPhe-Arg-Trp with a DPro-Pro motif, possessed the lowest potency at the mMC1R (1,800 nM), no activity at the mMC3R or mMC5R with concentrations up to 100 μM, and stimulated the mMC4R to 50% of the maximal level of NDP-MSH at 100 μM.
(4) Discussion
Melanocortin 1 Receptor Pharmacology
Prior chimeric ligands derived from the active loop of AGRP and the His-DPhe-Arg-Trp melanocortin agonist sequence result in sub-nanomolar agonist potency at the mMC1R, a receptor postulated to be involved in pigmentation (Chhajlani, V., et al. FEBS Lett. 1992, 309, 417-420; and Mountjoy, K. G., et al. Science 1992, 257, 1248-1251). The disulfide bridged Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2 was reported to possess 0.35 nM agonist potency at the mMC1R (Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390). Replacing the disulfide bridge with a lactam bridge, Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2, resulted in a peptide ligand with 0.2 nM agonist potency (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207; and Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075). Insertion of the His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Gly-Lys hexapeptide of the potent synthetic melanocortin agonist NDP-MSH into the active loop of the truncated mini-AGRP template resulted in cAMP stimulation when administered at 1 μM concentrations to cells expressing the hMC1R; similar cAMP accumulation was observed when His-Phe-Arg-Trp was inserted in the same template (Jackson, P. J., et al. Peptides 2005, 26, 1978-1987). A dose-response evalutation of this His-DPhe-Arg-Trp tetrapeptide inserted into the Arg-Phe-Phe sequence of mini-AGRP [Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2] demonstrated this peptide to possess 0.16 nM agonist potency at the mMC1R (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207). Both compounds MDES-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c from the present study possessed similar nanomolar or less potency at the mMC1R, with EC50 values of 0.35 nM and 1.1 nM, respectively. It may be speculated that the MC1R agonist potency of MDES-149-2c and Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2may be due to a similar presentation of the His-DPhe-Arg-Trp on a loop structure. Conversion of MDES-149-2c to MDE6-5-2c, which possesses similar potency, included removal of a Phe residue and Asn to Dap substitution. Either modification alone did not improve potency: truncation of the Phe (MDE6-3-2c) decreased agonist potency 34-fold relative to MDES-149-2c; 70-fold decreased potency was observed for the Asn to Dap substitution (MDE5-151-2c). Unexpectedly, compounds MDE5-151-1c and MDE6-12-1c were observed to be partial agonists at the mMC1R (FIGS. 1A-1D), stimulating the mMC1R 45% and 75% of the maximal NDP-MSH response, with EC50 values of 190 and 110 nM, respectively. Both peptides possessed an Asp to Dap substitution and lacked a His residue in the agonist sequence, though peptide MDE6-5-1c possessed these same modifications and was a full agonist at the mMC1R.
Melanocortin 3 Receptor Pharmacology
The melanocortin 3 receptor has been reported to be expressed in many different tissues; expression in the central nervous system has been linked to pathways involving energy homeostasis and food intake (Butler, A. A., et al. Endocrinol. 2000, 141, 3518-3521; and Irani, B. G., et al. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2011, 660, 80-87). Previously reported AGRP/NDP-MSH chimeric ligands Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2, Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2, and Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2 have been reported to possess 2.0 nM, 1.0 nM, and 30 nM potencies, respectively, at the mMC3R (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207; Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075; and Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390). The most potent compounds from the present study, MDES-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c, possessed agonist potencies of 32 and 40 nM respectively, most similar to the reported value for Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2. An additional two compounds were full agonists at the mMC3R (MDE6-3-2c and MDE5-151-2c; EC50=300 and 260 nM). Three compounds did not possess agonist activity at the mMC3R (MDE6-10-1c, MDE6-12-1c, and MDE5-147-1c) and five ligands partially stimulated the mMC3R at concentrations up to 100 μM (MDE6-12-2c, MDE5-147-2c, MDE5-149-1c, MDE6-3-1c, and MDE6-5-1c). Two peptides displayed partial agonist efficacy (MDE6-10-2c and MDE5-151-1c), stimulating cAMP to 65% and 70% of maximal NDP-MSH response and EC50 values of 510 and 3000 nM, respectively. The decreased potencies and activities at the mMC3R may indicate that this scaffold is not well situated for this receptor, perhaps due to intrinsic lower potency of AGRP at the mMC3R versus the mMC4R (˜10-fold) or by the addition of the Dap amino acid which previously was shown to impart some selectivity for the mMC4R over the mMC3R when the antagonist Arg-Phe-Phe tripeptide sequence was examined in this scaffold (Ericson, M. D., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58, 4638-4647).
Melanocortin 4 Receptor Pharmacology
The MC4R is expressed in numerous tissues; mice lacking this receptor possess an obese phenotype that is also observed in many mutations of the human form of the MC4R (Huszar, D., et al. Cell 1997, 88, 131-141; and Farooqi, I. S., et al. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003, 348, 1085-1095). Chimeric AGRP/NDP-MSH ligands Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2, Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2, and Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2 have been reported to possess 0.3 nM, 0.2 nM, and 1.4 nM potencies at the mMC4R (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207; Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075; Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390; and Xiang, Z. M., et al. Biochemistry 2007, 46, 8273-8287). Two ligands (MDE5-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c) possessed similar 1.4 nM and 1.6 nM potencies, respectively. Unlike the mMC3R, all ligands were able to stimulate the mMC4R, though three compounds (MDE5-147-2c, MDE6-12-1c, and MDE5-147-1c) stimulated a fraction of the maximal NDP-MSH response at 100 μM concentrations and peptide MDE5-151-2c was a partial agonist (70% maximal NDP-MSH stimulation, EC50=23).
Melanocortin 5 Receptor Pharmacology
The MCSR is expressed ubiquitously in the periphery and has been hypothesized to be involved in exocrine gland function (Chen, W. B., et al. Cell 1997, 91, 789-798). The previously reported ligands Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2, Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2, and Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2 possessed agonist potencies of 2 nM, 0.5 nM, and 0.6 nM at the mMC5R (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207; Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075; and Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390). The two most potent compounds, MDE5-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c possessed similar 0.45 nM and 0.3 nM agonist potencies at the mMC5R. One peptide (MDE6-12-1c) was unable to stimulate the mMC5R at concentrations up to 100 μM, while two ligands (MDE6-10-1c and MDE5-147-1c) partially stimulated the receptor at 100 μM concentrations. The remainder of the synthesized ligands possessed nanomolar to micromolar agonist potencies at this receptor.
Unlike the antagonist pharmacology previously reported which showed a beneficial antagonist potency and selectivity increase with a Dap residue (Ericson, M. D., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2015, 58, 4638-4647), there is not a clear trend for the Asn or Dap residue following the Trp amino acid for increased agonist potency or selectivity. Of the two most potent ligands that had similar activities at the MCRs, one possessed an Asn amino acid (MDES-149-2c) and one a Dap residue (MDE6-5-2). These peptides were also different lengths, with a heptapeptide sequence cyclized through a DPro-Pro motif in MDES-149-2c (His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe) and a hexapeptide in MDE6-5-2c (His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Dap-Ala). The sequential removal of the Phe and then Ala from MDES-149-2c resulted in decreased potencies at the receptor subtypes, indicating the heptapeptide sequence may be ideal for this sequence. Comparatively, the addition of the Phe residue or subtraction of the Ala from MDE6-5-2c both decreased potency. It appears as if both the Asn and the Dap substitutions are tolerable for an agonist ligand, and the size of the resulting cyclic peptides influences potency. Interestingly, MDES-149-2c possess the same purported active loop sequence as Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2 and possesses nearly identical pharmacology at all four receptors (0.35, 32, 1.4, and 0.45 nM for MDES-149-2c at the mMC1R, mMC3R, mMC4R, and mMC5R versus 0.16, 30, 1.4, and 0.56 nM for Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2) (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2194-2207), though these were measured using different cAMP assays and direct comparisons may not be valid. Overall, MDES-149-2c is 26 residues shorter compared to Ac-mini-(His-DPhe-Arg-Trp)hAGRP-NH2 and possesses similar pharmacology, and may represent a better lead molecule since it is more quickly synthesized, less expensive to make, and does not possess disulfide bonds that could scramble to unfavorable positions. The MDES-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c peptides also possess modest selectivity for the mMC4R over the mMC3R (23- and 25-fold, respectively), more favorable than the 7- and 5-fold reported for the Tyr-c[Cys-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Cys]-Tyr-NH2 and Tyr-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-Dap]-Tyr-NH2 AGRP/NDP-MSH chimeric ligands (Wilczynski, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 3060-3075; and Singh, A., et al. J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 1379-1390). This inherent scaffold selectivity for the MC4R may be beneficial for leads in generating MC4R selective probes.
The DPhe-Arg-Trp tripeptide sequence has previously been shown to be the minimal sequence with activity at the MCRs, with the addition of His increasing ligand potency (Haskell-Luevano, C., et al. Peptides 1996, 17, 995-1002). This trend was also observed with this set of AGRP/NDP-MSH chimeric ligands, where removal of the His resulted in ligands with similar or decreased agonist potencies. An exception was MDE5-151-1c, which possessed full agonist efficacy at the mMC4R with an EC50 of 100 nM compared to MDE5-151-2c possessing a His residue, which was a partial agonist at the mMC4R (70% maximal NDP-MSH stimulation, EC50=23 nM). These two compounds also presented a unique pharmacology at the mMC1R, mMC3R and mMC4R. Peptide MDE5-151-1c, lacking a His residue, was a partial agonist at the mMC1R and mMC3R and a full agonist at the mMC4R. The opposite pattern was observed in MDE5-151-2c, which possessed a His residue and was a full agonist at the mMC1R and mMC3R and was a partial agonist at the mMC4R. The presence of the His residue dictated whether the ligand was a full or partial agonist for this sequence at receptor subtypes.
The control peptide NDP-MSH is a synthetic analogue of a-MSH that is potent at the mMC1R, mMC3R, mMC4R, and mMC5R, and possesses modest selectivity (6 to 26-fold) for the mMC1R over the other receptors (Sawyer, T. K., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1980, 77, 5754-5758). Select ligands from this study did possess significant selectivity (>100-fold) for one receptor subtype, often due to low potency of this ligand series at the mMC3R. Three compounds were >100-fold selective for the mMC1R over the mMC3R (MDE6-12-2c, MDE5-149-1c, MDE6-3-1c), while MDE6-10-1c was >2500-fold selective for the mMC1R over the mMC3R. Three of these compounds (MDE5-149-1c, MDE6-3-1c, and MDE6-10-1c) were derived from the serial truncation of Phe and Ala residues lacking a His, indicating a possible series effect for selectivity. For the mMC4R over the mMC3R, MDE6-3-1c was >100-fold selective and MDE5-149-1c and MDE6-5-1c were greater than 300-fold selective. Six compounds were selective for the mMC5R over the mMC3R, with MDE6-3-2c, MDE6-5-2c, and MDE6-12-2c possessing >100-fold selectivity, and MDE6-3-1c, MDE5-149-1c and MDE6-5-1c possessing >1000-fold selectivity for the mMC5R over the mMC3R. The ligand MDE6-10-1c was also >1000-fold selective for the mMC1R over the mMC5R. One compound (MDE6-12-1c) was a partial agonist at the mMC1R (75% NDP-MSH stimulation, EC50=110 nM) and possessed no agonist activity at the mMC3R or mMC5R and partially stimulated the mMC4R at concentrations up to 100 μM (FIGS. 1A-1D), and possessed >500-fold selectivity for the mMC1R over the other receptor subtypes. No compounds were selective for the mMC3R, and there was no selectivity observed between the mMC4R and mMC5R.
The present structure-activity relationships study involved the conversion of potent, AGRP antagonist-derived ligands into agonists at the melanocortin receptors. Two compounds, MDE5-149-2c and MDE6-5-2c were nanomolar agonists at the mMC4R, previously indicated to be involved with energy homeostasis and food intake, and possessed some modest selectivity for the mMC4R over the mMC3R (23- and 25-fold). The uniqueness of this chimeric scaffold may allow these derivatives to bypass the detrimental side-effects associated with previously described MC4R agonists and potentially be developed into anti-obesity probes and therapeutics with further studies. Two compounds were identified that were >1000-fold selective for the mMC5R over the mMC3R (MDE5-149-1c and MDE6-5-1c) and an additional ligand was found selective for the mMC1R over other receptor subtypes (MDE6-12-1c). Further development of these compounds may generate useful probes for investigating the different physiological roles of the melanocortin receptors in vivo.

EXAMPLE 5
As described herein, compound 2 (c[Pro-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Dap-Ala-DPro] (SEQ ID NO:4)) has been administered in male mice. This compound has been administered via a cannula directly into the brain (ICV administration) or through an injection into the spinal cord (IT administration), at three different doses each administration route (2 nmol, 5 nmol, and 10 nmol). After compound administration, the mice were monitored in TSE metabolic cages, which record food intake, water intake, ambulatory activity (how many times a mouse breaks a light beam, which can give an indication of toxicity), respiratory-exchange ratio (RER, ratio between amount of CO2 produced in metabolism and O2 consumed, giving an indication if fat [RER value closer to 0.7] or carbohydrates [RER value closer to 1] is the energy source being utilized), and energy expenditure.
FIGS. 2A-2B show cumulative food intake following ICV administration (24 and 72 h time points). A dose response was observed for the first 24 h, such that increasing amounts of the compound (2) resulted in a further decreased food intake. The 10 nmol dose resulted in a decreased food intake through 72 h. Following IT administration, decreased food intake was observed, but was not in a dose-response manner such as the ICV administered compound (FIGS. 3A-3B).
The RER also indicated a dose effect following ICV administration (FIGS. 4A-4C). Graphed by dose (2 nmol, 5 nmol, 10 nmol), the 2 and 5 nmol dose indicated a decreased RER compared to vehicle control in the first 24 h (FIGS. 4A-4B). This indicates that the mice were utilizing more fats for energy; coupled with the decreased food intake, which would provide carbohydrates, this indicates the mice were beginning to utilize fat stores. The effect was more robust in the 10 nmol dose, where the RER for the first 24 h maintained a level indicative of fat utilization, suggesting the mice were eating less while utilizing fat stores (FIG. 4C). A more modest effect was observed following IT administration. In all cases, the curves overlap with the vehicle controls at 24 h, indicating that following a single dose, the effects on RER lasted 24 h.
The ambulatory activity, water intake, and energy expenditure were not different from compound to vehicle treated animals.
EXAMPLE 6
As described herein, c[Pro-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Asn-Ala-Phe-DPro] (SEQ ID NO:1) and c[Pro-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Dap-Ala-DPro] (SEQ ID NO:4) have been further modified in an effort to enhance their blood brain barrier penetrance. Specifically, the Ala residue has been replaced with a Lys residue, through which 0, 1, 2, or 3 Arg residues have been incorporated as described herein (see, Table 3). These modifications may allow alternative administration routes to be employed (e.g., routes not involving direct administration into the CNS). The activity of these compounds may be evaluated using assays known in the art or as described in the Examples.
