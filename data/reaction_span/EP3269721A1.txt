[Technical Field]
The present invention relates to a bi-cyclic pyridine compound or a salt thereof which is useful as a pharmaceutical, specifically a pharmaceutical for treating nocturia, and to a pharmaceutical containing such a compound as an active ingredient.
[Background Art]
Nocturia is a lower urinary tract symptom defined as "the complaint that the individual has to wake at night one or more times to void" (Neurourol Urodyn 2002; 21: 167-178). Nocturia prevalence increases with age (J Urol 2010; 184: 440-446), and major patients with nocturia are older adults. It impairs quality of life (QOL) in that it disrupts sleep (Eur Urol 2010; 57: 488-498) and increases risk of fracture. Causes of nocturia are global polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, reduced bladder capacity, and sleep disorders, but in many patients nocturia is considered to be multifactorial (Eur Urol 2012; 62: 877-890). Nocturnal polyuria is defined as nocturnal urine volume greater than 33% of the 24-hour urine volume and is present in about 80% of the patients with nocturia (J Urol 2011; 186: 1358-1363).
Arginine-vasopressin (hereinafter, abbreviated as AVP) is an antidiuretic hormone that is a peptide consisting of nine amino acids, and is biosynthesized and secreted in the hypothalamic-pituitary gland axis. AVP receptors are classified into three subtypes: V1a, V1b, and V2. Known major pharmacological actions of AVP in the periphery are vasoconstriction through the V1a receptor, and antidiuresis through the V2 receptor. AVP acts on the renal tubules to promote renal water reabsorption, decreasing the urine volume. For this reason, decreased nocturnal AVP secretion with age is assumed to be a cause of increased nocturnal urine volume (J Int Med 1991; 229: 131-134, BJU Int 2004; 94: 571-575).
Stimulation of the V2 receptor is expected to improve nocturia. Desmopressin (hereinafter, abbreviated as dDAVP) is a selective V2 receptor agonist used for treating patients with nocturia, and is reported to decrease nocturnal urine volume and the number of nocturnal voids, resulting in an increased duration of initial undisturbed sleep (J Urol 2013; 190: 958-964, and J Urol 2013; 190: 965-972). Unfortunately, V2 receptor agonists theoretically induce fluid retention and increase risks of hyponatremia. It is reported that V2 receptor agonists should be administered with caution and monitoring of serum sodium level to older adults who are the majority of patients with nocturia (Neurourol Urodyn 2004; 23: 302-305).
Placental leucine aminopeptidase (hereinafter, abbreviated as P-LAP) is an enzyme that degrades L-leucine-Î²-naphthylamide, oxytocin and AVP (Arch Biochem Biophys 1992; 292: 388-392), and was cloned as an aminopeptidase by Rogi et al. in year 1996 (J Biol Chem 1996; 271: 56-61). The insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (hereinafter, abbreviated as IRAP) cloned by Keller et al. from rat epididymal fat pads has homology of 87% to human P-LAP. The IRAP is subsequently suggested to be an aminopeptidase that cleaves AVP and reported to be a rat homolog of human P-LAP (J Biol Chem 1995; 270: 23612-23618, Am J Physiol Endocrinol Metab 2007; 293: E1092-E1102). Angiotensin IV (AT4) receptor isolated from bovine adrenal is also suggested to be an IRAP as a result of biochemical and pharmacological studies (J Biol Chem 2001; 276: 48623-48626).
Experiments using P-LAP knockout mice indicate that administration of AVP in wild type mice and P-LAP knockout mice results in much reduction of 24-h urine volume in P-LAP knockout mice, although no significant difference is observed in the 24-h urine volume between the wild type and P-LAP knockout mice. It suggests the possible involvement of P-LAP in regulation of the urine volume through degradation of AVP (NPL 1).
Compounds represented by Formula (A) below are reported to be IRAP inhibitors useful as a therapeutic agent for dementia and diabetes, and the like (PTLs 1 and 2).wherein X is O, NR' or S, and other symbols are defined as in PTLs 1 and 2.
Tripeptide analogs of AT4 with 13- to 14-membered ring structure exhibits excellent IRAP inhibitory activity (NPL 2).
However, no antidiuretic agent or therapeutic agents for nocturia based on a mechanism mediated by P-LAP (or IRAP) has been reported.
Under such circumstances, there exists need for a safe antidiuretic agent that is suitable for treating nocturia.

The present invention provides a compound useful as an active ingredient of a pharmaceutical composition, specifically a pharmaceutical composition for treating nocturia.
[Means for Solving Problem]
The inventors have assumed that inhibition of nocturnal activity of P-LAP, i.e. aminopeptidase that cleaves AVP, would maintain and/or increase an endogenous AVP level to enhance the antidiuretic effect, which would contribute to a decreased number of nocturnal voids, and have extensively studied compounds which inhibit P-LAP (including rat IRAP, a homolog of human P-LAP).
As a result, the inventors have found that a compound represented by Formula (I) below has excellent P-LAP inhibitory activity. The inventors have evaluated antidiuretic effects in water-loaded rats and have found that the compound represented by Formula (I) increases endogenous AVP levels by inhibiting P-LAP and consequently reduces urine production. Based on such findings, the inventors have accomplished the present invention.

(1) Inhibition of IRAP activity
Rat epididymal fat pads were homogenized and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 minutes to obtain microsomes containing IRAP. The microsomes (with a total protein content of 55 Âµg/well) were mixed with a solvent (dimethyl sulfoxide; hereinafter, abbreviated as DMSO (final concentration: 0.1%)) or with each test compound (common ratio: 3; maximum concentration: 10 ÂµM). AVP was then added to the solution to a final concentration of 25 ÂµM, and the resulting solution was allowed to react for one hour at 37Â°C. An aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (hereinafter, abbreviated as TFA) solution was then added to the solution (final concentration: 1%) to stop the enzymatic reaction. Residual AVP was then determined by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Based on the results, IC50 values (nM), i.e. concentrations required for 50% inhibition of decrease in AVP level in the solvent control group, of the individual test compounds were calculated by the Sigmoid-Emax model nonlinear regression analysis to evaluate inhibition of IRAP activity.
The results are shown in Table 1, and indicate that the example compounds effectively inhibit AVP degradation by IRAP, i.e. a rat homolog of human P-LAP.
(2) Inhibition of human P-LAP (hP-LAP) activity
HEK293 cells forced to transiently express hP-LAP (J Biol Chem 1996; 271: 56-61) were prepared by lipofection, homogenized, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 minutes. Microsomes containing hP-LAP were thereby prepared. The microsomes (with a total protein content of 0.5 to 1.5 Âµg/well) were mixed with a solvent (DMSO; final concentration: 0.1%) or with each test compound (common ratio: 3; maximum concentration: 10ÂµM). AVP was then added to the solution into a final concentration of 25 ÂµM, and the resulting solution was allowed to react for one hour at 37Â°C. An aqueous TFA solution was then added to the solution (final concentration: 1%) to stop the enzymatic reaction. Residual AVP was then determined by mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Based on the results, IC50 values (nM), i.e. concentrations required for 50% inhibition of decrease in AVP level in the solvent control group, of the individual test compounds were calculated by the Sigmoid-Emax model nonlinear regression analysis to evaluate inhibition of hP-LAP activity. The results are shown in Table 1 and indicate that the example compounds effectively inhibit AVP degradation by hP-LAP.

(3) Antidiuresis test in water-loaded rats (oral administration)
Individual test compounds were dissolved in a vehicle (containing 10% N,N-dimethylformamide, 10% propylene glycol, and 80% distilled water), and the resulting solution was orally administered to the rats. When a test compound is a free base, one molar equivalent hydrochloric acid was added to dissolve the compound in the solvent. Rats in a vehicle control group were administered only with the vehicle. One hour after the administration, 30 ml/kg of distilled water was orally administered to the rats. One hour after the water loading, the urine volume was measured (urine volumes less than 0.3 ml were considered as 0 ml) to calculate the ratio of the urine volume (urinary excretion rate) to the amount of water load. The inhibition of urination (%) in the compound-administered group in comparison with the vehicle control group was calculated in accordance with the following expression (each group consisted of four to five rats): Inhibition of urination%={[(urinary excretion rate in the vehicle controlgroup)â(urinary excretion rate in the compound-administered group]/(urinaryexcretion rate in the vehicle control group)}Ã100
Table 2 shows inhibition of urination (%) observed when some example compounds included in compounds of Formula (I) were respectively administered in the amount of 3 mg/kg. The results indicate that the example compounds have an excellent antidiuretic effect.

The results shown above suggest that the compounds represented by Formula (I) inhibit P-LAP (IRAP), i.e. an aminopeptidase that cleaves AVP, to inhibit degradation of endogenous AVP, which results in a reduced urine production.
It is known that the plasma AVP level is strictly regulated by plasma osmolality and that an excessive water intake reduces AVP production and secretion to cause diuresis. The present inventors had obtained the results, from the antidiuresis test in continuously hydrated rats with additional water loading using the compounds having an antidiuretic effect based on P-LAP inhibition, revealing that in a case of an excessive water intake caused by the additional water loading, reduced urine volumes were recovered (PCT/JP2015/065344). It is suggested that the decreased endogenous AVP level caused by the additional water loading reduces the antidiuretic effect. Therefore, the compound represented by Formula (I) having the antidiuretic effect based on P-LAP inhibition is expected to be an agent for treating nocturia involving lower risks of hyponatremia even in a case of an excessive water intake, unlike V2 receptor agonists which requires attention for hyponatremia.

[Industrial Applicability]
The compound represented by Formula (I) or a salt thereof has inhibitory activity against P-LAP, i.e. the AVP-degrading enzyme, and maintains and/or increases an endogenous AVP level to reduce urine production. Such a compound thus is expected to be used as an agent for treating nocturia, and is also expected to be used as an agent for treating any other voiding dysfunction or polyuria associated with a decreased AVP level, such as pollakiuria, urinary incontinence, and nocturnal enuresis.
