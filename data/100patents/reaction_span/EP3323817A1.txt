TECHNICAL FIELD
The present application relates to anilinopyrimidine derivatives as EGFR inhibitors, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the same, and methods or uses for treating EGFR-mediated diseases using the same.
BACKGROUND ART
EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), also known as HER1 or ErbB1, is a receptor for cell proliferation and signal transduction of the epithelial growth factor (EGF). EGFR belongs to a member of the ErbB receptor family which includes EGFR (ErbB-1), HER2/c-neu (ErbB-2), HER3 (ErbB-3) and HER4 (ErbB-4). EGFR is a transmembrane glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 170KDa, which belongs to a tyrosine kinase receptor.
EGFR is located on the surface of cell membranes and is activated by binding to ligands including EGF and TGFÎ±. Upon being activated, EGFR undergoes a transition from a monomer to a dimer. The dimer includes not only the binding of two identical receptor molecules (homodimerization) but also the binding of different members of the human EGF-associated receptor (HER) tyrosine kinase family (heterodimerization). EGFR can activate its intracellular kinase pathways after dimerization, resulting in the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain and the stimulation to many intracellular signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival.
There exist high or abnormal expressions of EGFR in many solid tumors. EGFR is associated with tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis, tumor invasion, metastasis and the inhibition of apoptosis. Possible mechanisms include the followings: enhanced downstream signal transduction caused by the high expressions of EGFR; the sustained activation of EGFR caused by the increased expressions of mutant EGFR receptors or ligands; the enhanced effect of autocrine loops; the destruction of receptor downregulation mechanisms; and the activation of aberrant signaling pathways, etc. Overexpressions of EGFR play an important role in the progression of malignant tumors. For example, overexpressions of EGFR have been found in gliocyte, kidney cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer and other tissues.
Aberrant expressions of EGFR and Erb-B2 play a crucial role in tumor transformation and growth. In the case of lung cancer, EGFR is expressed in 50% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases and its expression is associated with poor prognosis. The two factors allow EGFR and its family members to be major candidates of targeted therapy. Two types of small molecule inhibitors targeted to EGFR, gefitinib and erlotinib, were rapidly approved by the FDA of USA for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patients who have no response to traditional chemotherapy.
Early clinical data indicated that 10% of NSCLC patients have response to getifinib and erlotinib. Molecular biological analysis shows that in most cases, drug-responsive patients carry specific mutations in the EGFR-encoding genes: the deletion of amino acids at positions 747-750 in exon 19 accounts for 45% of mutations, and 10% of mutations occur in exons 18 and 20. The most common EGFR-activating mutations (L858R and delE746_A750) result in an increase in affinity for small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and a decrease in affinity for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) relative to wild type (WT) EGFR. T790M mutation is a point mutation in exon 20 of EGFR, which leads to acquired resistance to the treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. A recent study shows that the combination of L858R and T790M mutations has a stronger affinity for ATP than L858R alone, and TKIs are ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors, and thereby resulting in a decreased binding rate between TKIs and kinase domains.

In vitro activity test
1. Method of in vitro enzymatic assay
EGFR or EGFR (T790M, L858R) kinase was expressed and purified through an insect cell expression system, or purchased as commercially available products.
A platform for testing the activities of EGFR or EGFR (T790M, L858R) kinase was established based on the Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) method provided by Cisbio Inc., and was used for determining the activities of compounds. The compounds were diluted at a 10-fold gradient with 100% DMSO with a starting concentration of 1 ÂµM. 4 Âµl of each concentration was taken and added to 96 Âµl of reaction buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 0.02% NaN3, 0.01% BSA, 0.1 mM Orthovanadate, 5 mM MgCl2, 50 nM SEB, 1 mM DTT). 2.5 Âµl of the mixture was taken and added to a 384-well plate (OptiPlate-384, PerkinElmer), and then 2.5 Âµl of the kinase was added. After thoroughly mixing by centrifugation, 5 Âµl of ATP and TK Substrate-biotin was added to initiate the reaction. The 384-well plate was incubated in an incubator at 23Â°C for a period of time, and then the reaction was terminated by adding 5 Âµl of Eu3+-Cryptate labeled TK-Antibody and 5 Âµl of streptavidin-XL665. The fluorescence values were read on Envision (PerkinElmer) after incubating in the incubator for 1 hour. The IC50 values of the compounds were calculated using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software.
2. Cell proliferation assay
Human non-small cell lung cancer cells NCI-H1975 were cultured in RPIM-1640 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-plus-streptomycin in a cell incubator (37Â°C, 5% CO2). The cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 2,000 cells per well (volume: 195 Âµl) and cultured overnight. On the next day, the compounds were added. In particular, the compounds were diluted at a 3-fold gradient with a starting concentration of 10 mM. 4 Âµl of each concentration was taken and added into 96 Âµl of culture medium. Then, 5 Âµl of the mixture was taken and added to a cell culture medium (final DMSO concentration being 0.1%, v/v). After treatment for 72 hours, the medium was aspirated and 30 Âµl of CellTiter-GloÂ® (Promega) reagent was added. Fluorescence signals were read on Envison (Perkin Elmer), and IC50 values of the compounds for inhibiting cell proliferation were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0.
Human skin squamous carcinoma cell line A431 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-plus-streptomycin in a cell incubator (37Â°C, 5% CO2). In the tests of the compounds, the bottom substrate was at a concentration of 0.6%. Cells were re-suspended with 0.3% low-melting-point agar, and then seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 2,000 cells per well (100 Âµl). The compounds were diluted at a 3-fold gradient with a starting concentration of 10 mM. 2 Âµl of each concentration was taken and added to 98 Âµl of culture medium, and then 5.3 Âµl of the mixture was added to the cell culture medium (final DMSO concentration being 0.1%, v/v). After treatment for one week (7 days), 20 Âµl of CellTiter-BlueÂ® (Promega) reagent was added, and the plate was incubated at 37Â°C for 4 hours. Fluorescence signals were read on Envison (Perkin Elmer), and IC50 values of the compound for inhibiting cell proliferation were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5.0.

Pharmacokinetic Assay
Healthy adult male rats were subjected to single-dose intragastric administration of the test compounds at a dose of 10 mg/kg with 20% sulfobutyl ether-Î²-cyclodextrin as an excipient. Before the experiment, the animals were fasted overnight, and the fasting time last from 10 hrs prior to the administration to 4 hrs after the administration. At 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hrs after the intragastric administration, blood sampling was conducted. Approximately 0.3 mL of whole blood was collected from retro-orbital venous sinus, and placed into tubes that contained heparin as an anticoagulant. The samples were centrifuged at 4Â°C and 4000 rpm for 5 min. The plasma was transferred into centrifuge tubes, and stored at -80Â°C till being analyzed. Concentrations of test compounds in the plasma samples were analyzed with non-validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Plasma concentration-time data of individual animals was analyzed using WinNonlin (Professional Edition, version 6.3; Pharsight Company) software. Non-compartmental model was introduced in concentration analysis. The pharmacokinetic parameters of the test compounds were calculated.
