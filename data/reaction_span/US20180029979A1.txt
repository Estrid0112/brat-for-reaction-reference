FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a novel isothiocyanate XPO1 protein inhibitor and a preparation process and application for the same.
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART
Some specific proteins in organisms are imported in or exported out of nucleus by specific transport proteins, and these transport proteins are divided into importins and exportins (exporting molecules out of nucleus). The proteins imported in or exported out of nucleus include a nucleus-importing localization sequence (NLS) or nucleus-exporting localization sequence (NES) which can interact with the specific transport proteins. XPO1 (also referred to as CRM1 protein) is a most major nucleus exportin.
Cargo proteins of XPO1 include some specific tumor inhibitory proteins such as P53, P21, BRCA1, FOXOs, BCR-Abl, NPM and so on. A lot of research shows that XPO1 protein is highly expressed in various tumor types such as ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, osteosarcoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lymphoma and leukemia, and this high expression is related to poor prognosis effect of these tumors. The over-expression of XPO1 causes the tumor inhibitory proteins to be imported in cytoplasm and to be degraded such that the tumor inhibitory proteins lose tumor inhibitory action, which is considered a mechanism of cancer cells escaping from apoptosis. (Semin Cancer Biol. 2014, 27:74-86; Biochem Pharmacol. 2012, 83(8):1021-32.)
Tumor metastasis is a major reason for malignant tumors to be hardly treated and to have high mortality, and is also one of reasons for malignant tumors to show resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In addition, it is reported that most compounds having antitumor action is useless for tumor metastasis and for anti-radiotherapy and chemotherapy tumors (Methods Mol Med. 2005; 111:127-48). An active substance having antitumor metastasis action has very high clinical value, but such active substance is few disclosed in prior arts. Transition from epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells (Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition, EMT) means an ability of epithelial cells morphologically transiting to fibrocytes or mesenchymal cell phenotypes and achieving migration, and plays a key role during metastasis of cancer cells. In recent years, EMT route has become a research focus for tumor metastasis. E-cadherin is an important cell adhesion molecule, and is closely related to genesis, invasion and metastasis of tumor. Snail protein is a transcription factor, can directly inhibit transcription of E-cadherin, and has an action of promoting cell migration. A lot of evidence has showed that expression level of Snail protein is up-regulated but expression level of E-cadherin is down-regulated before malignant tumor cells become metastatic, which improves tumor cell metastasis potency. Thus, a compound capable of inhibiting expression of Snail protein would have antitumor cell metastasis potential.
In addition to the tumor inhibitory proteins, the cargo proteins of XPO1 also include many key proteins related to inflammation and immune processes, such as IκB, Cox-2, RXRα, Commd1, HIF1 and so on. IκB is an NF-κB protein inhibitor, and binds to NF-κB in nucleus to inactive transcription function of NF-κB, thereby adjusting signal path of NF-κB which is closely related to inflammation and immune processes. In inflammation or immune misadjustment process, over-expression of XPO1 causes IκB to be degraded in cytoplasm such that IκB loses the regulating effect on NF-κB. (Shock. 2008, 29(2):160-6; J Biol Chem. 1999, 274(13):9108-15].
XPO1 protein is also responsible for nuclear export of retinoid receptor (RXRα). RXRα is highly expressed in liver, and plays a central role in metabolic regulation of bile acid, cholesterol, fatty acid, and steroid. In pathological process of liver inflammation, XPO1 protein is highly expressed which remarkably reduces retinol receptor level in nucleus. Thus, in the related pathological process such as inflammation or immune misadjustment, inhibiting over-expression of XPO1 protein is potentially beneficial. (J Biol Chem. 2006, 281(22):15434-40).
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) shows high morbidity worldwide, and number of people infected with inflammatory bowel disease per year in United States reaches up to two millions. In China, people infected with inflammatory bowel disease are rising year by year, inflammatory bowel disease has become a major reason for digestive system common diseases and chronic diarrhea, and patients are mostly children and young adults. Inflammatory bowel disease refers to various intestinal inflammatory diseases, mainly including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is still unclear, and is generally considered an immune system disease. Studies show that inflammation response is out of control in pathological process of inflammatory bowel disease, and some cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor TNF-α and interleukin molecule IL-6 are over-expressed and damage normal tissues and organs. Thus, treating inflammatory bowel disease generally needs to regulate over-expression of the cytokines (J Clin Invest. 2007; 117(3):514-21). Clinically, aminosalicylic acid formulation such as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and sulfasalazine can be used to treat inflammatory bowel disease, but such drug has certain curative effect only for mild cases, and generally has no curative effect and easily develops drug-resistance as well for severe cases. In addition, clinically, immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and methotrexate can be used to suppress the immune response to own body. Unfortunately, these clinical therapeutic methods generally have very limited relieving effect on inflammatory bowel disease, and may have obvious toxic and side-effects including liver toxicity and bone marrow suppression toxicity. Searching a more safe and effective drug for inflammatory bowel disease has very great significance.
In addition to the above pathological processes, XPO1-mediated nuclear export is also closely related to package, integrity and maturity processes of various virion such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus (H1N1 line, and fowl and bird H5N1 line), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human papilloma virus (HPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue fever virus (Dungee), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, West Nile virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV). (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2002, 99(22):14440-5; J Virol. 2008, 82(21):10946-52; J Biol Chem. 2009, 284(23):15589-97; J Virol. 2009; 83(11):5353-62). Thus, inhibiting the expression of XPO1 protein is also potentially beneficial for cutting off viral transport.
Semen raphani which has an alias of radish seed and a Latin name of Semen Raphani, is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, and is mature seed of cruciferous plant radish. Semen raphani is generally used to relieve symptoms such as food retention and Qi stagnation, abdominal fullness and distention, belching, diarrhea, coughing and excessive phlegm, and dyspnea and chest congestion. Modern pharmacognostical studies show that its main active component is sulforaphene (C6H9NOS2) which is an isothiocyanate compound. In previous studies, we were surprised to find that sulforaphene and its derivative are good XPO1 protein inhibitors, and have very good potential clinic application value.

Example 6. Measurement of Inhibitory Activity of Representative Compound for XPO1 Protein
NES (nuclear export signal) is a nuclear export signal peptide recognized by XPO1 protein. XPO1 recognizes NES sequence peptide segment of biomacromolecule and exports the biomacromolecule out of nucleus. NES-GFP protein is obtained by co-expressing green fluorescence protein GFP and NES sequence peptide segment by using a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Inhibitory activity of the representative compound for XPO1 protein can be assessed by detecting influence of the compound on NES-GFP cell localization.
The cells were digested with trypsin, counted, and inoculated on 96-well plate in an amount of 1.5×104 cells per well. Sixteen hours later, NES-GFP plasmid was transfected with liposome. Twenty-four hours later, each representative compound solution, SFN molecule solution and PEITC molecule solution were added to treat for 2 hours respectively, and then 100 μl of Hochest 33258 (1 mg/ml) was added to stain nucleus. Inhibitory effect on NES-GFP nuclear export was observed with a laser confocal microscope (Olympus-IX71) and expressed as percentage. Results are shown in FIG. 1 and Table 1.
In the present invention, SFE is sulforaphene, SFN is sulforaphane (C6H11NOS2), and PEITC is phenylethylisothiocyanate (C9H9NS) which are used as control compounds in the experiment, and other compounds have the following structural formulae which can be obtained by the process of the present invention using corresponding material compounds respectively.
<img> id-US20180029979A1-20180201-C00038.TIF </img>
The laser confocal micrograph showing the inhibitory effect of the representative compound I-01 for XPO1 is specifically shown in FIG. 1. It can be seen from FIG. 1 that most of NES-GFP protein emitting green fluorescence is congregated in nucleus, which proves the representative compound has good inhibitory activity for XPO1 protein.
The experimental results show that each representative compound of the present invention has good inhibitory activity for XPO1 protein, and that the inhibitory activity of the compound of the present invention for XPO1 protein is several times to hundreds of times higher than that of two natural compounds SFN and PEITC, and is also remarkably better than that of non-aryl substituted congeneric compounds represented by sulforaphene. The specific results are shown in Table 1.

Example 7. Evaluation on Macroscopic Pathological Changes of IBD Animal Model Treated with Representative Compound
Eight-week-old male SD rats (10 rats per group) were fasted for 24 hours and anaesthetized with diethyl ether. 50% ethanol and TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid) were mixed to prepare a solution. In the IBD model group, a tube made of vinyl resin was inserted 5 cm from anus, and enteroclysis was performed with the TNBS solution in a dose of 100 mg/kg. The rats were hung upside down 30 seconds later after the enteroclysis to ensure no leakage of the TNBS solution. In the control group, the TNBS solution was replaced with normal saline with which enteroclysis was performed. Seven days later after the enteroclysis with the TNBS solution or normal saline, animals were sacrificed and dissected. In each of the drug-treated groups, each representative compound, SFE, SFN and PEITC were intragastrically administrated daily in a dose of 80 mg/kg from one day before the enteroclysis with TNBS. Two weeks later after treated with the drugs, the animals were sacrificed and dissected, and large intestine thereof was taken out and fixed in 4% formalin solution for 30 minutes. The large intestine of the animals was cut lengthwise from the mesentery side to take photos for rectum portion and measure the weight of rectum. Based on the macroscopic observation and judgment score (Table 2-1), ulceration and bleeding states of rectum portion were scored according to the macroscopic observation scoring standard.

5 & Large scale severe erosion and bleeding
</table>
The specific macroscopic judgment scores after treated with the representative compound of the present invention are shown in Table 2-2. It can be seen from the results that compared to the normal saline enteroclysis group, the TNBS enteroclysis group shows relatively remarkable colon tissue ulceration, bleeding and necrosis phenomena, and has a relatively high macroscopic pathological judgment score. The 5-ASA-treated group, SFN-treated group and PEITC-treated group merely show a small relief extent in colon tissue bleeding and ulceration phenomena. Compared to these, the group treated with each representative compound shows little colon tissue damage and greatly relieved colon tissue bleeding and ulceration phenomena, proving that the test compound of the present invention provides good protection and therapeutic effect on IBD, which is remarkably better than the 5-ASA-treated group, SFN-treated group and PEITC-treated group, and is also remarkably better than the non-aryl substituted isothiocyanate compounds represented by sulforaphene.

Example 8. Evaluation Test of Representative Compound in Inhibiting Cytokine Level Change Caused by NF-κB Signal Path
Inflammatory bowel disease is an autoimmune disease. It is found in the experiment that the representative compound of the present invention regulates NF-κB which is a key signal path directly related to immune system disease and inflammation, by inhibiting XPO1 protein. The therapeutic effect of the representative compound for the immune system disease or inflammation can be assessed by detecting change in levels of some important cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6 at downstream of the signal path. Three days later after making the TNBS model (disease high-incidence season) in the Example 7, serums of three animals from each of the control animal group, model animal group and drug-treated group were collected, protein and tRNA were extracted, and levels of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in the serums were detected by the ELISA method, respectively. The results show that the drug-treated group animals treated with the representative compound of the present invention show significantly decreased levels of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6 in the serum compared to the model group, showing that the representative compound has significant regulating effect on the NF-κB signal path and has very good therapeutic effect on inflammatory bowel disease. The change in levels of TNF-α and IL-6 of the IBD model treated with the representative compound is specifically shown in Table 3 and Table 4.

Example 10. Detection of Inhibitory Activity of Representative Compound for Formation of HMLE-Snail Cell Line Spheroids
HMLE-Snail cell line is one of most classic cell models for studying tumor cell metastasis and EMT path. HMLE-Snail cell line highly expresses Snail protein, and thus one of most remarkable features thereof is that it has spherical cellular morphology (spheroid). Thus, the ability of the representative compound in inhibiting EMT path and consequently inhibiting tumor cell metastasis can be assessed by detecting the inhibitory activity of the representative compound for the formation of HMLE-Snail cell line spheroids (Cell 2008, 133:704-715). The HMLE-Snail cell line used in the present invention was donated by Dr. Robert Weinberg from America Massachusetts Whitehead Institute. HMLE-Snail cells were suspended in a liquid culture medium (in which B-27 and N-2 were added, purchased from America Invitrogen Corporation) containing DMEM/F12 in a ratio of 1:1, in an amount of 1.0×103 cells/ml, and cultured in an ultra low attachment culture plate so as to allow spheroids to be formed. Seven days later, spheroids were collected by centrifugation, and counted. The formation of cell spheroids was observed with microscope, and inhibitory activities of 10 μg/ml of SFN molecule, 10 μg/ml of PEITC molecule, 10 μg/ml of docetaxel, and 10 μg/ml of each representative compound, with which HMLE-Snail cells were treated for 24 hours, for the formation of HMLE-Snail cell line spheroids, were evaluated respectively. Detection effects are shown in Table 5. Docetaxel is a common clinical chemotherapy drug.

Note of Table 5:
the control is cell not treated with drug, and the data shown in the table are that the cell colony number of the control is 100%, and the inhibitory activity of the drug is expressed by the cell colony percentage of the drug-treated group and expressed as follows: Drug inhibitory activity = (cell colony number of drug-treated group/cell colony number of control group) × 100%.

Example 15. Therapeutic Effect of Representative Compound for Ovarian Cancer Intraperitoneal Metastasis Animal Model
The ovarian cancer intraperitoneal metastasis animal model is one of most classic animal models for studying anti-ovarian cancer metastasis drug. Sixty 5 to 6-week-old female nudemice with similar weight (BALB/c-nu/nu) were chosen. SK-OV3 (high metastasis type ovarian cancer cell line) stably expressing green fluorescence protein was screened, and prepared into a cell suspension of 2×106 cells/100 μl with serum-free PRMI1640 medium. 100 μl of the above cancer cell suspension was administrated to each nudemouse by intraperitoneal injection, and growth condition of cancer was observed at a fixed period, and the nudemice were continued to be fed. Five days later after the cancer implantation, the 60 female mice were divided into 10 groups randomly, six mice per group, intraperitoneal injection was performed once a day for 3 weeks to the control group (0.9% normal saline) and the drug-treated group (80 mg/kg of the representative compound) respectively, and cancer growth and metastasis conditions were observed with stereomicroscope at a fixed period. Three weeks later, the cancer was detected with a small animal in vivo imaging apparatus (Xenogen, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University) and photos thereof were taken. Based on the inhibitory action of the representative compound on the intraperitoneal metastasis of ovarian cancer, the therapeutic effect of the representative compound on the ovarian cancer intraperitoneal metastasis animal model was assessed. Results are shown in Table 10. In the table, T represents the drug-treated group, and C represents the blank control group. T/C is (V/V0 of compound-treated group)/(V/V0 of blank control group) in which V represents the cancer volume of mouse on the day the detection was performed, and V0 represents the cancer volume of mouse on the day the administration begun. The therapeutic effect of the representative compound I-06 on the ovarian cancer intraperitoneal metastasis model, i.e. the abdominal tumor pathological improvement effects after 3 weeks, is specifically shown in FIG. 2.
