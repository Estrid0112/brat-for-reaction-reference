BACKGROUND
Although a direct process for vinyl arene formation from arenes and olefins offers potential advantages, acid-based (i.e., Friedel-Crafts or zeolite catalysts) catalysis occurs by electrophilic aromatic substitution and does not offer a viable pathway to directly generate vinyl arenes. Transition metal complexes that catalyze olefin hydroarylation by olefin insertion into a metal-aryl bond followed by aromatic C-H activation have been reported as alternatives to acid-based catalysts. For these catalysts, β-hydride elimination from a M-CH2(CH2)nCH2Ar (n=0-10); Ar=aryl) intermediate and dissociation of vinyl arene provides a route for the direct oxidative hydroarylation of olefin. A targeted catalytic cycle exists for the direct oxidative hydroarylation of olefins to produce vinyl arenes, and, since vinyl arenes are easily hydrogenated, a route to alkyl arenes, but despite precedent for the key steps in this catalytic cycle, designing a selective catalyst represents a substantial challenge as many viable and undesirable side reactions are likely to have activation barriers that are similar or lower than the reactions along the desired catalytic cycle. In addition to these possible side reactions, designing a catalyst that achieves high turnover numbers (TON) is difficult since the conditions and the presence of potentially reactive intermediates could be anticipated to result in catalyst decomposition and/or deactivation. Consistent with these challenges, there is no example of a catalyst that achieves the desired results.

General Discussion
Embodiments of the present disclosure provide for Rh(I) catalysts, methods of making alkenyl substituted arenes (e.g., allyl arene, vinyl arene, and the like), methods of making alkyl substituted arenes, and the like. In general, embodiments of the Rh(I) catalyst can be used in a one-step conversion of arenes (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) and olefins to form alkenyl substituted arenes. Embodiments of the present disclosure are advantageous over previously processes for at least one or more of the following: oxidants can be regenerated using oxygen, efficient conversion of the olefin, moderate temperatures (e.g., about 100-250° C.), broad range of pressures for gaseous olefins and broad range of concentrations for liquid or solid olefins, and formation of truly linear (i.e., anti-Markovnikov or straight-chain) alkyl, allyl, and vinyl arenes as the major products. In an embodiment, a catalytic process using a Rh(I) catalyst can convert arenes and olefins to straight-chain alkyl, vinyl or allyl arenes and, hence, through facile hydrogenation of the vinyl or allyl arenes straight-chain alkyl arenes.
In general, embodiments of the present disclosure relate to the oxidative hydroarylation of an olefin (e.g., ethylene) and an arene (e.g., benzene) to form an alkenyl substituted arene (e.g., an allyl or vinyl arene such as styrene) using a Rh(I) catalyst (described below). In an embodiment, the reaction scheme can be represented as one of the following:
<img> id-US20180065116A1-20180308-C00005.TIF </img>
The following scheme illustrates the development of processes that use dioxygen (pure or, ideally, from air) as an additional oxidant.

EXAMPLES
Now having described the embodiments of the disclosure, in general, the examples describe some additional embodiments. While embodiments of the present disclosure are described in connection with the example and the corresponding text and figures, there is no intent to limit embodiments of the disclosure to these descriptions. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents included within the spirit and scope of embodiments of the present disclosure.
Example 1
Rising global demand for fossil resources has prompted a renewed interest in catalyst technologies that increase the efficiency of conversion of hydrocarbons from petroleum and natural gas to higher value materials. Styrene is currently produced from benzene and ethylene through the intermediacy of ethylbenzene, which must be dehydrogenated in a separate step. The direct oxidative conversion of benzene and ethylene to styrene could provide a more efficient route, but achieving high selectivity and yield for this reaction has been challenging. Here we report that the Rh catalyst (FIDAB)Rh(TFA)(η2-C2H4) [FIDAB=N,N'-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene; TFA=trifluoroacetate] converts benzene, ethylene and Cu(II) acetate to styrene, Cu(I) acetate, and acetic acid with 100% selectivity and yields ≧95%. Turnover numbers>800 have been demonstrated with catalyst stability up to 96 hours.
Vinyl arenes are important precursors for fine chemical synthesis as well as for the preparation of plastics and elastomers.(1-5) For example, styrene is produced globally on a scale of ˜18.5 million tons.(2) Current methods for the large-scale production of vinyl arenes involve multiple steps, typically beginning with arene alkylation using a Friedel-Crafts (e.g., AlCl3 with HF) or zeolite catalyst followed by energy-intensive dehydrogenation of the alkyl group (FIG. 1.1).(1-6) Friedel-Crafts catalysis suffers from the use of harsh acids, including HF, low selectivity for the mono-alkylated product (poly-alkylation is inherent to the mechanism), and the generation of stoichiometric waste.(2) Zeolite catalysts have improved the process for benzene alkylation, yet these catalysts still require high temperatures (generally 350 to 450° C.) and give poly-alkylated products.(2, 7-10)
An alternative method for the production of vinyl arenes is a direct and single-step oxidative arene vinylation (FIG. 1.1). If the terminal oxidant is oxygen from air (either introduced in situ or used to recycle a different in situ oxidant), the net reaction is the conversion of benzene, ethylene and oxidant to styrene and water, or, more generally, arene, olefin and oxidation to vinyl or allyl arene).(11) Acid-based (i.e., Friedel-Crafts or zeolite catalysts) catalysis occurs by electrophilic aromatic substitution and does not offer a viable pathway to directly generate vinyl arenes. Transition metal complexes that catalyze ethylene hydrophenylation by benzene C-H activation followed by ethylene insertion into a metal-phenyl bond have been reported as alternatives to acid-based catalysts (FIG. 1.2).(12-25) For these catalysts, β-hydride elimination from a M-CH2CH2Ph intermediate and dissociation of styrene provides a route for the direct oxidative vinylation of benzene (FIG. 1.2).
Previously, the use of platinum(II) catalysts for the hydrophenylation of ethylene to produce ethylbenzene has been studied.(16-19, 26-28) Through a combination of experimental and computational mechanistic studies, it was discerned that a competing β-hydride elimination pathway from Pt-CH2CH2Ph intermediates to form a Pt-styrene hydride complex, which can lead to the formation of free styrene.(28) Here, the formation of styrene also results in catalyst decomposition.(27) The thermodynamic driving force for the formation of Pt presents a substantial challenge to achieving long-lived vinyl arene production with these catalysts.(11)
FIG. 1.2 shows a targeted catalytic cycle for the direct oxidative vinylation of benzene to produce styrene. Despite precedent for the key steps in this catalytic cycle, designing a selective catalyst represents a substantial challenge as many competing side reactions (shown in red) are likely to have activation barriers that are similar to or lower than those of the reactions along the desired catalytic cycle. In addition to these possible side reactions, designing a molecular catalyst that achieves high turnover numbers (TON) is difficult because the oxidative conditions and the presence of potentially reactive metal-hydride intermediates could be anticipated to result in catalyst decomposition.
Table 1 compares previously reported homogeneous catalysts for direct oxidative styrene synthesis from ethylene and benzene.(29-34) Generally, all suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: low selectivity, low yield, low TON, and/or use of oxidants that cannot be regenerated using oxygen. Herein, a rhodium catalyst for the selective one-step production of styrene from benzene, ethylene and Cu(II) salts is reported. A Cu(II) salt is particularly attractive as the in situ oxidant because of industrial precedent for recycling reduced Cu(I) using oxygen or air. In the commercial Wacker-Hoechst process for ethylene oxidation,(35, 36) use of oxygen or air to reoxidize Cu(I) to Cu(II) has proven viable both in situ as well as in a second step.(37)

FIG. 1.3 illustrates the synthesis of a representative catalyst, (FIDAB)Rh(TFA)(η2-C2H4) (1) (RT=room temperature). Heating a 20 mL benzene solution of (FIDAB)Rh(TFA)(η2-C2H4) (1) (0.001 mol % relative to benzene) with ethylene and Cu(OAc)2 (120 equivalents relative to 1) to 150° C. affords 58/62 turnovers (TO) of styrene after 24 h (for all TOs reported, two runs were performed, and both results are given). Aliquots of the reaction mixture were analyzed by GC/FID using relative peak areas versus an internal standard (decane). This corresponds to quantitative yield based on the Cu(II) limiting reagent. The calculated yield here assumes two equivalents of Cu(II) are consumed to produce two equivalents of Cu(I) per equivalent of styrene. No other products were observed upon analysis of the reaction mixture by GC/MS or GC/FID, indicating high selectivity for styrene production. Detection limits for the instruments were equivalent to ˜1 TO of product. Specifically, we looked for evidence of stilbene, biphenyl, and vinyl acetate production, as these are the most commonly observed byproducts in previously reported catalysis (Table 1).
With a competent catalyst in hand, we next sought to optimize reaction conditions. The effect of oxidant properties on catalysis with 1 was the first parameter investigated. Both soluble (copper 2-ethylhexanoate [Cu(OHex)2] and copper pivalate [Cu(OPiv)2]) and insoluble (copper acetate [Cu(OAc)2] and copper trifluoroacetate hydrate [Cu(TFA)2]) Cu(II) salts were screened. FIG. 1.5 shows a plot of turnovers versus time for the various Cu(II) oxidants. Using a turnover frequency (TOF) calculated after 4 hours of reaction, soluble Cu(OHex)2 gives the fastest initial rate with a TOF of 2.8×10−3 s−1, but the reaction does not reach 100% yield relative to oxidant until 28 h, which may indicate that catalyst deactivation occurs. Cu(OAc)2 affords a slower initial rate than Cu(OHex)2, with a TOF of 2.8×10−4 s−1 after 4 h, but this oxidant provides a more stable catalytic process. Both Cu(TFA)2 and Cu(OPiv)2 afford slower initial rates; reactions with Cu(OPiv)2 reach 92% yield after 28 h, whereas reactions with Cu(TFA)2 produce 19 TO styrene (32% yield) after 20 h.
In order to study catalyst longevity, we varied the amount of Cu(OAc)2. Between 60 and 240 equivalents (relative to 1) the yield of styrene relative to oxidant was always >95% (FIG. 1.7). These near-quantitative yields demonstrate that the catalytic process using 1 as a precursor is stable and long-lived. For a reaction using 0.0001 mol % 1 and 2400 equivalents of Cu(OAc)2, the catalyst remained active over a period of 96 hours and afforded a TON of 817/852. A plot of TO versus time shows that the Rh catalyst is stable through at least 96 hours (FIG. 1.5). Importantly, 1 is tolerant to a large excess of oxidant without any decrease in activity. The effect of temperature on catalysis was also examined (FIG. 1.8). Generally, the rate of reaction increased with temperature. Minimal activity (<1 TO) was also observed at temperatures<100° C. The optimal temperature in this case proved to be 150° C.
The reaction rate also increases with increasing ethylene pressure. To determine the TOF, we measured TO after 4 h of reaction. FIG. 1.4 shows a plot of TOF vs ethylene pressure. A linear correlation is observed. Thus, the reaction rate appears to have a first-order dependence on ethylene concentration, and more rapid rates of reaction are expected at higher olefin concentrations. This is in contrast to previously reported Pt(II) and Ru(II) catalysts for the hydrophenylation of ethylene, which show an inverse dependence on ethylene pressure.(14, 17)

Example 2
This Example describes the catalytic process that can be used for the conversion of aromatics and olefins to straight-chain vinyl arenes and, hence, through facile hydrogenation straight-chain alkyl arenes. The advantages of this catalyst process over previously reported catalysts at least one or more of the following:1) oxidants that can be regenerated using oxygen or air2) efficient conversion of olefin,3) moderate temperatures (100-250° C.),4) broad range of pressures for gaseous olefins, and broad range of concentrations for liquid olefins, and5) formation of truly linear, straight-chain (anti-Markovnikov) allyl, vinyl and alkyl arenes as the major products.
Catalysts employing transition-metals and copper oxidants are combined with the rhodium (I) catalyst and an air recyclable oxidant. In an embodiment, the catalyst includes a simple rhodium (I) salt, either monomeric or multi-nuclear in rhodium, coordinated by anionic salts such as halides, acetates, and the like and/or by neutral ligands such as olefins, carbonyls, phosphines and the like. Similar to those described herein, the Rh(I) catalyst can include [(ethylene)2Rh(μ-TFA)]2), (PPh3)3Rh(Cl), (CO)12Rh4 or a rhodium complex of the form L2Rh(L')X, L3RhX, or (L1X1)Rh(L'). In an embodiment, L2 can be comprised of two independent and neutral ligands coordinated to the metal through either nitrogen donors, phosphorus donors, oxygen donors, sulfur donors, and the like, where the donors can take the form of amines, pyridine, phosphines, phosphites, ethers, ketones, imines, and the like; or comprised of a neutral bidentate ligand coordinated to the metal center through either nitrogen donors, phosphorus donors, oxygen donors, sulfur donors, and the like, where the donor can take the form of bipyridines, diimines, bipyrimidine, bisoxazoline diphosphines, phosphinimine, imidates, bispyrazole, bisimidazole, bisphosphorus, and the like; or comprised of a neutral mixed donor ligand including a mixture of the donor groups listed above. In an embodiment, L' can include a neutral ligand coordinated to Rh(I), where the neutral ligand can include olefins, imines, ethers, nitriles, ketones, water, sulfur based ligands, phosphines, and the like. In an embodiment, X can be a mono-anionic, either coordinated to the metal or not, such as, but not limited to, halides, acetates, alkyl groups, aryl groups, and the. In an embodiment, L3 can represent a tridentate ligand coordinated to the metal center in κ2 or κ3 fashion through either nitrogen donors, phosphorus donors, oxygen donors, sulfur donors, or a combination thereof, where the tridentate ligand can include terpyridines, pyridyl diimines, trisphosphine, diphosphine imine, bis(phosphine)pyridine, and the like. In an embodiment, L1X1 can represent a monoanionic bidentate or tridentate ligand coordinated to the metal center in a κ2 or κ3 fashion through either nitrogen donors, phosphorus donors, oxygen donors, sulfur donors, or a combination thereof, where the monoanionic bidentate or tridentate ligand can include diphosphine aryl, imidates, diketiminates, trispyrazolylborate, trisimidazoles, and the like. In an embodiment, the catalyst can be prepared and isolated pure or generated in situ by combination of a Rh(I) salt and appropriate ligand.
A second component of the process can include the oxidant, which can include an air recyclable oxidant such as, but not limited to, copper(II) salts of the form CuX2 (where, for example, X can be, but is not limited to, halide, acetate, trifloroacetate, pivalate, and the like). In addition, oxidants that can be recycled using air or oxygen, such as but not limited to, include iodates, periodates, nitrogen dioxide, can be used. The reactants can include a combination of olefins and arenes, in various amounts, such as, but not limited to, ethylene, propylene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, isobutylene, vinyl ketones, acrylates, acrylonitriles, etc. and benzene, toluene, naphthalene, halogenated arenes, arenes each optionally with variable functionality such as, but not limited to, ketones, aldehydes, ethers, alkyl, vinyl, nitro, and the like.
In one example of a catalytic reaction, a combination of (FIDAB)Rh(TFA)(η2-C2H4) [FIDAB=N,N'-bis(pentafluorophenyl)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene; TFA=trifluoroacetate] (0.001 mol %), copper(II) acetate (0.012 mol %), ethylene (25 psig), and benzene are heated at 150° C. for 12 hours (eq 1). The product, styrene, is produced with 100% selectivity and with a high yield relative to oxidant (≧95%). The catalyst has been demonstrated to be effective over a broad range of ethylene pressures. This process has been extended to other aromatics, olefins and oxidants, including electron-rich arenes and substituted olefins.

This type of catalyst has also been shown to catalyze the hydrophenylation of propylene. In another example of a catalytic reaction, a combination of (2tBuDAB)Rh(TFA)(NCMe) [2tBuDAB=N,N'-bis(2-tertbutylphenyl)-2,3-dimethyl-1,4-diaza-1,3-butadiene] (0.001 mol %), copper(II) acetate (0.024 mol %), propylene (25 psig), and benzene are heated at 180° C. for 24 hours (eq 2). The product mixture consists of linear products (allyl benzene and β-methylstyrene) and branched products (a-methylstyrene) in a 9:1 ratio, while maintaining the high yield (>90%) relative to oxidant. The catalyst has been demonstrated to be effective over a broad range of propylene pressures.

Combining [(C2H4)2Rh(μ-Cl)]2 (0.001 mol %) with 0.002 mol % ancillary ligand (diimines, diketiminates, tridentate ligands, etc.) in benzene forms the catalyst precursor. Subsequent addition of copper(II) acetate (0.024 mol %) and pressurization with ethylene (25 psig) allows for a catalytic run upon heating to between 120-200° C. for 12 hours (eq 5). The product, styrene, is produced with greater than 80% selectivity and with a high yield relative to oxidant (≧85%).

It should be noted that ratios, concentrations, amounts, and other numerical data may be expressed herein in a range format. It is to be understood that such a range format is used for convenience and brevity, and thus, should be interpreted in a flexible manner to include not only the numerical values explicitly recited as the limits of the range, but also to include all the individual numerical values or sub-ranges encompassed within that range as if each numerical value and sub-range is explicitly recited. To illustrate, a concentration range of “about 0.1% to about 5%” should be interpreted to include not only the explicitly recited concentration of about 0.1 wt % to about 5 wt %, but also include individual concentrations (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, and 4%) and the sub-ranges (e.g., 0.5%, 1.1%, 2.2%, 3.3%, and 4.4%) within the indicated range. In an embodiment, the term “about” can include traditional rounding according to significant figures of the numerical value. In addition, the phrase “about ‘x’ to ‘y’” includes “about ‘x’ to about ‘y’”.
