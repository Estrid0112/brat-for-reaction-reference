TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention belongs to the field of pharmaceuticals, specifically, the present invention relates to a novel 4-arylamino quinazoline hydroxamic acid compound having histone deacetylase inhibitory activity, a preparation method of the compound, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound, and the use of the compound and the pharmaceutical composition in the preparation of histone deacetylase inhibitor drugs.
BACKGROUND TECHNIQUES
Tumor is a kind of major diseases which threaten human health, and tumor treatment has been attracting close attention all around the world. Traditional chemotherapeutic drugs block cell division non-specifically and thereby cause cell death, which damages the normal cells of the human body while killing the tumor cells. In addition, quite a few cytotoxic drugs have a limited therapeutic scope, and can easily cause adverse reactions. Long-term administration of such drugs will also result in drug resistance.
In recent years, pathogenesis of tumors is further understood in the cellular and molecular level with the rapid development of combinatorial chemistry, molecular biotechnology, structure-based drug design, computer science and other technology, so that biotherapy for tumor has made great progress and reached a new era of molecular targeting therapy. Targeted anticancer drugs can target specific pathways, prevent tumor growth and reduce toxicity to normal cells. They have common characteristics which are: non-cytotoxic and tumor cell-targeting; having effect on cell regulation and stabilization; generally can not be achieved dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose in clinical studies; able to kill tumor cells which are not sensitive to or having resistance to chemotherapy, and resulting in better efficacy in combination with the conventional treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy).
At present, many anti-tumor targeting sites have been found, and histone deacetylase and microtubule are important targets for developing new anti-cancer drugs. Factors that cause tumor gene expression and abnormal activity of gene expression products are two major changes, i.e., genetic and epigenetic changes. Among them, epigenetics refers to a way of gene expression regulation, which affects transcriptional activity of a gene without involving DNA sequence changes. The molecular basis is mainly related to two aspects: one is DNA methylation modification, and the other is acetylation modification of chromatin histones. Acetylation and deacetylation of chromatin histones is one of the key processes in regulating gene expression, in which two enzymes, i.e., histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC), determine the degree of histone acetylation. Histone deacetylase is a kind of enzyme catalyzing removal of an acetyl group from lysine on histones. It plays a critical role in chromatin condensation and chromatin remodeling as well as in the gene regulation involved, and is an important part of epigenetic regulation. Abnormality of this regulation mechanism is closely related to tumorigenesis and tumor development. HDAC includes four classes and 18 different isoforms (Class I: HDAC1, 2, 3, 8; Class II: HDAC4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10; Class III: Sirt1-7; Class IV: HDAC11). HDAC and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) regulate histone acetylation modification together, wherein, HAT acetylates specific lysine residues on histones, while HDAC is responsible for removal of such modification for the residues (J Mol Biol, 17-31, 2004, 388:1). Histone acetylation leads to loosening of the chromatin structure and thereby facilitates binding of other DNA-binding proteins,which has a deacetylation effect on multiple proteins in the cytoplasm, such as tumor suppressive factor p53, molecular chaperone proteins (Johnstone & Licht, Cancer Cell 4, 13-18, 2003), DNA damage repair protein Ku70 (Kerr et al., Cell Death and Differentiation 19, 1317-1327, 2012), microtubule protein a-tubulin. In tumors, coincidentally, the deacetylation of various proteins in the cytoplasm usually results in an impact of facilitating tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs or escaping from programmed cell death, for example, deacetylation of p53 protein will promote the degradation of the protein (Kim et. al., Apoptosis 18, 110-120, 2013). Thus, small molecule drug development focusing on such important epigenetic inheritance affecting molecular targets such as HDAC, has becoming a hotspot nowadays in the field of tumor targeting therapy worldwide.
Histone deacetylase inhibitor is one of the hotspots in the field of anti-tumor drug research in recent years. Studies have shown that histone deacetylation inhibitor can effectively inhibit tumor cell proliferation, induce tumor cell differentiation and apoptosis and anti-tumor angiogenesis, and has inhibitory effect on migration, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. It can be divided into four categories: (i) hydroxamic acid analogues, wherein the representative compounds include SAHA (licensed in 2006 for CTCL), Panobinostat (licensed in 2015 for treating multiple myeloma), Belinostat (Phase II clinical trials), and etc.; (ii) benzamide analogues, wherein the representative compounds include Entinostat (Phase II clinical trials), Mocetinostat (Phase II clinical trials), Chidamide (licensed in 2014 for treating CTCL), and etc.; (iii) cyclic peptides, wherein the representative compound includes Romidepsin (licensed in 2009 for CTCL); (iv) aliphatic carboxylic acids, wherein the representative compounds include Valproic acid (Phase III clinical trials), VP-101 (Phase II clinical trials), and etc.. In addition, there are some inhibitors not embraced by the above-mentioned four categories, such as RG2833 (Phase I clinical trials), CXD101 (Phase II clinical trials) and etc., due to their particular molecular structures. (Giannini et al., Future Med. Chem. 4 (11), 1439-1460, 2012; Zhiming Li et al., Int. J. Biol. Sci. 10 (7), 757-770, 2014).
SAHA (also known as Vorinostat) falls into the hydroxamic acid category, and is the first histone deacetylase inhibitor licensed for treating cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), its application in treating solid tumors isalso in clinical trials. Chidamide was licensed in December 2014 for treating CTCL. In February 2015, Panobinostat was licensed for treating multiple myeloma. Romidepsin (FK228) developed by Celgene (USA) is a histone deacetylase inhibitor of the cyclic tetracycline category, and was licensed for treating CTCL in USA in 2009 and licensed by the US FDA in 2011 for treating recurrent/refractory peripheral T cells lymphoma (PTCL). Since SAHA, Panobinostat and FK228 are all non-selective inhibitors for HDAC and can inhibit a number of signaling pathways, they have strong toxic side effects. Clinical data have shown that SAHA can cause thrombosis and neurotoxicity, while for FK228, the incidence of medication-related adverse reactions above Phase III is up to 66% and it has cardiotoxicity. In addition, for both of the drugs SAHA and FK228, their absorption peak concentrations, which directly associated with clinical validity, are significantly higher than the concentrations required for inhibiting the growth of normal or tumor cells in vitro, and thereby result in direct cytotoxicity to normal cells. This increases toxic side effects of drug administration and severely limits their use in a comprehensive tumor treatment in combination with other drugs having different mechanisms. The pre-clinical animal trials of Entinostat (MS-275, a benzamide-based HDAC inhibitor developed by Bayer (Germany) and Syndax,USA) show that the compound has significant anticancer activity against hematopoietic cancer, lung cancer and rectal cancer, and is a selective HADC inhibitor. Since its elimination half-life in human body is approximately up to 100 hours and it has a huge difference in drug exposures, it exhibits poor tolerance in clinical trials in human and therefore the administration dose cannot be increased. Chidamide, a novel anti-cancer drug innovated in China, is the first licensed isoform selective histone deacetylase inhibitor for oral administration in the world, and also the first Chinese innovator drug whose patent right was authorized to USA and other developed countries, it is available in the market in December 2014. This marks that the core technologies and capability of integrating the whole process of structure-based molecular design, targeting site research, safety evaluation, clinical development, and industrialization in our country are significantly improved, and is a historic breakthrough in the pharmaceutical industry in China. So far, there are a variety of HDAC inhibitors available in the market or undergoing clinical evaluation.
The HDAC inhibitors of the hydroxamic acid category consist of enzyme surface recognition region (Cap), a linking region (Linker) and zinc ion binding region (ZBG). In order to find the compounds having better activity than SAHA inhibitor, the researchers have done considerable studies on such compounds, wherein the main research of the hydroxamic acid inhibitor is focused on structural optimization of the enzyme surface recognition region and the linking region while keeping the hydroxamic acid groups in the metal binding region unchanged, in order to discover the derivatives with stronger activity and higher selectivity and safety. How to improve anti-tumor activity as well as reduce the impact on normal tissues or cells is an issue of great concern.

EXAMPLE 130
The following experiments were used to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention to inhibit HDAC kinases, as well as in vitro anti-proliferative activity and in vivo anti-tumor activity thereof.
1. In Vitro Assay for Determining the HDAC Inhibitory Activity of the Small Molecule Compounds of the Present Invention
The HDAC inhibitory activity was determined by fluorescence-coupled acetylated peptide substrate assay (Lys-Ac-AMC). HDAC1 protein was purchased from BPS Bioscience, and the reaction buffer system was a modified tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer (pH 7.0). The small molecule compounds of the present invention were prepared by being dissolved in 100% DMSO. HDAC was prepared in a buffer at a certain concentration as an enzyme solution; trypsin and fluorescent group 4-amino-7-coumarin coupled-acetylated peptide (Ac-peptide) substrate were prepared in a buffer at a certain concentration as a substrate solution. The compounds were added into the reaction wells in a 384-well plate at a designed concentration of 10 μM, 1 μM, 0.5 μM, 0.1 μM, 0.05 μM, 0.01 μM, 0.005 μM, 0.001 μM, and 0.00005 μM, respectively, and then 15 μl of the HDAC solution was added into the reaction wells (15 μl of blank buffer to the control well). After incubation at room temperature for 15 minutes, 10 μl of the substrate solution was added to initiate the reaction, wherein the final concentration of HDAC1 protein was 6 nM, the final concentration of trypsin was 0.05 μM, and the final concentration of Ac-peptide was 8 μM. The 384-well plate was incubated at room temperature under dark condition. After incubation for 1 hour, the fluorescence intensity was measured by a microplate reader (the emission wavelength was 355 nm and the absorption wavelength was 460 nm). The results were analyzed by GraphPad Prism software and IC50 values were calculated according to the formula:
<in-line-formulae>Y=Background Data+(Top Data−Background Data)/(1+10̂((LogIC50-X) a curve slope)),</in-line-formulae>
where Y: the inhibition rate (%) and X: the concentration of the compound.
2. Determination of Cell Proliferative Activity
Tumor cell line A375: human melanoma cell; H460: lung adenocarcinoma cell; Hela: human cervical cancer cell; HepG2: human liver cancer cell; and SKOV-3: human ovarian cancer cell, were all purchased from ATCC and cultured to logarithmic phase according to the cultivation protocol recommended by ATCC. The cells in the logarithmic phase were plated onto a 96-well plate at 2000-3000 cells/well; in the case of adherent cells, the cells should be adherent to the wall. The compounds were then added into the experiment wells at a designed concentration and incubated for 96 hours. After that, the cell proliferative activity was determined by MTT assay for the tumor cells representing the solid tumor model and by cck-8 assay for the tumor cells representing the hematologic tumor model. The results were analyzed by Graph Pad Prism software and the IC50 values were calculataed according to the formula:
<in-line-formulae>Y=Background Data+(Top Data−Background Data)/(1+10̂((LogIC50-X) a curve slope)),</in-line-formulae>
where Y is the inhibition rate (%) and X is the concentration of the compound.

5. Therapeutic Effect of the Compounds II-2 and III-2 on the MV4-11 Chronic MMelomonocytic Leukemia Model
Female NOD/SCID mice weighing 18-20 g were adopted in the experiment and were subcutaneously inoculated with 5.0×105 MV4-11 cells. 24 mice were inoculated in total and randomly divided into 4 groups: the compound II-2 group, the compound II-2 group and the SAHA group (positive drug group) (setting a dose of 50 mg/kg), as well as the physiological saline group as a negative control group. At Day 10 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the drugs were intravenously administered to the mice once every other day, continuously for a total of 12 times. After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 1 and suggested that, compared with the blank control group, the compound III-2 significantly inhibited tumor growth in the tumor-bearing nude mice (P<0.01), and the activity of the compound III-2 was superior to that of the positive control group SAHA. The tumor weight of the treatment groups was significantly lower than that of the control group.
6. Therapeutic Effect of the Compounds II-2, III-1 and III-2 on the Colon Cancer HCT116 Model
Female nude mice weighing 18-20 g were adopted in the experiment and were subcutaneously inoculated with 5.0×105 HCT116 cells. 28 mice were inoculated in total and randomly divided into 4 groups: the compound II-2 group, the compound III-2 group and the SAHA group (setting a dose of 50 mg/kg), the compound III-1(setting a dose of 10 mg/kg), as well as the physiological saline group as a negative control group. At Day 10 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the compounds II-2, III-1 and III-2 were intravenously administered to the mice, and SAHA was intraperitoneally administered. Administration was conducted once every other day, continuously for a total of 9 times. After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 2.
The experiment results suggested that, compared with the blank control group, the compounds II-2, III-1 and III-2 significantly prolonged the survival time of mice (P<0.01), and the effect of the compounds II-2, III-1 and III-2 prolonging the survival time of mice was superior to that of the positive control group. The tumor weight of the treatment groups was significantly lower than that of the control group.
7. Western Blot Assay for Detecting the Level of Acetylated Proteins with the Preferred Compound III-2
The compounds or the positive control compound were added into each group of cells already adherent to the walls (2×106 HCT116 cells or 5×106 MV4-11 cells) at a designed concentration. After treatment for 4 hours, trypsin was added for digestion, followed by collecting the cells. After washing with cold PBS twice, the cells were lysed by adding RIPA lysis solution (which was purchased from Beyotime, Art. No.: P0013B, adding 1 mM PMSF before use), allowing for lysis on ice for 30 minutes while vortexing at intervals. The lysate was subjected to ultrasonic treatment on an ice bath (ultrasonicated for 3 seconds and repeated 5 times for each group at an interval of 10 seconds). The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 20 min at 4° C. and then mixed the SDS-PAGE loading buffer (purchased from Beyotime, Art. No.: P0015F). The mixture was heated in boiling water for 5 minutes to obtain a protein sample. The protein concentration of the sample was quantified by BCA method. 20 1.tg total protein from each group was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and 5μl of a pre-stained protein marker (purchased from Thermo, Art. No.: 26616) was loaded to an additional selective lane in order to compare protein molecular weights as well as to detect the transmembrane result. When the bromophenol blue bands ran close to the bottom of the gel, the electrophoresis was terminated and the proteins on the gel were transferred to a PVDF membrane at a pore size of 0.22 μm. After 1.5 hours of transmembrane at a constant current of 200 mA, the PVDF membrane was removed and blocked in 5% skimmed milk for 1 hour. After completion of blocking, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody (Ac-H3 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz, Art. No.: sc-56616; Ac-α-tubulin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz, Art. No.: sc-23950) overnight at 4° C. and then washed with TBS/T for 10 minutes for 3 times. The membrane was incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour, and then washed with TBS/T for 10 minutes for 3 times. After washing with TBS for 5 minutes, the membrane was exposed and developed by using a film in the darkroom. The detected GAPDH protein was an internal reference protein (GAPDH antibody was purchased from ZSGB-Bio, Art. No.: TA-08).
It can be seen from FIGS. 3 and 4 that the positive drug SAHA was a broad-spectrum HDACi inhibitor and could up-regulate acetylation of tubulin and H3, while the compound III-2 was a selective inhibitor of HDAC6. In addition, HDAC6 was a protease associated with α-tubulin deacetylation. Thus it was verified by western blot that the compound III-2 inhibited α-tubulin deacetylation. It was found that the compound III-2 could up-regulate the acetylated α-tubulin protease in a dose-dependent manner. The deacetylation of Ac-H3 by the compound III-2 was also demonstrated.

At Day 10 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the compound III-2 and SAHA were intragastrically administered once every other day, continuously for a total of 8 times (during the course of the experiment, there were two experimental animals died accidentally in the III-2 12.5 mg/kg dose group). After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 5.
The experiment results suggested that, compared with the solvent group, the tumor inhibitory rate of the compound III-2 at the doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg was 51.28%, 58.64%, 60.37% and 66.05%, respectively; the tumor inhibitory rate of the control drug SAHA group was 59.23%. Thus, the compound III-2 had a significant effect on inhibiting the growth of the colon cancer HCT116 subcutaneous tumor model, and the effect was superior to the control drug SAHA.
12. Therapeutic Effect of the Preferred Compound III-2 on the Ovarian Cancer A2780s Model
Female nude mice weighing 16-20 g were adopted in the experiment and were subcutaneously inoculated with 5.0×106 A2780s cells. 30 mice were inoculated in total and randomly divided into 5 groups: the preferred compound III-2 groups (setting a three-dose gradient of 12.5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg), the control drug SAHA group (setting a dose of 100 mg/kg), and the physiological saline group as a solvent control group. At Day 12 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the compound III-2 and SAHA were intragastrically administered once every other day, continuously for a total of 16 times. After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed (in either of the III-2 50 mg/kg group and the SAHA group, there was one mouse died), and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 6.
The experiment results suggested that, compared with the solvent group, the tumor inhibitory rate of the compound III-2 at the doses of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg was 78.49%, 82.02% and 81.70%, respectively; the tumor inhibitory rate of the control drug SAHA group was 72.46%. Thus, the compound III-2 had a significant effect on inhibiting the growth of the ovarian cancer A2780s subcutaneous tumor model, and the effect was superior to the control drug SAHA.
13. Therapeutic Effect of the Preferred Compound III-2 on the B-Cell Lymphoma HBL-1 Model
Female NOD/SCID mice weighing 20-25 g were adopted in the experiment and were subcutaneously inoculated with 1×107 HBL-1 cells. 48 mice were inoculated in total and randomly divided into 6 groups: the preferred compound III-2 groups (setting a four-dose gradient of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg), the HDAC6 selective inhibitor ACY1215 group as a control drug group (at a dose of 40 mg/kg), and the physiological saline group as a solvent control group. At Day 14 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the compound III-2 and ACY1215 were intragastrically administered once every other day, continuously for a total of 9 times. After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 7.
The experiment results suggested that, compared with the solvent group, the tumor inhibitory rate of the compound III-2 at the doses of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg was 31.70%, 25.23%, 58.22% and 56.88%, respectively; the tumor inhibitory rate of the control drug ACY1215 group was 26.75%. Thus, the compound III-2 had a significant effect on inhibiting the growth of the B-cell lymphoma HBL-1 subcutaneous tumor model, and the effect was superior to the control drug ACY1215.
14. Therapeutic Effect of the Preferred Compound III-2 on the B-Cell Lymphoma Ramos Model
Female NOD/SCID mice weighing 20-24 g were adopted in the experiment and were subcutaneously inoculated with 1×107 Ramos cells. 48 mice were inoculated in total and randomly divided into 6 groups: the preferred compound III-2 groups (setting a four-dose gradient of 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg), the HDAC6 selective inhibitor ACY1215 as a control drug group (at a dose of 40 mg/kg), and the physiological saline group as a solvent control group. At Day 8 after inoculation of the tumor cells, the compound III-2 and ACY1215 were intragastrically administered, once every other day, continuously for a total of 6 times. After drug withdrawal, the mice were weighed (during the course of the experiment, there was a mouse died in the III-2 80 mg/kg dose group, indicating that this dose may exhibit toxicity to a few individuals), and the tumor volume, formation rate and tumor weight of the mice were also observed. The results were shown in FIG. 8.
The experiment results suggested that, compared with the solvent group, the compound III-2 at the two doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg had no effects on inhibiting tumor growth, while the tumor inhibitory rate of the compound III-2 at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg was 22.54% and 58.79%, respectively; there were no inhibitory effects of tumor growth in the control drug ACY1215 group. Thus, the compound III-2 at a dose of 80 mg/kg had a significant effect on inhibiting the growth of the B-cell lymphoma Ramos subcutaneous tumor model, and the effect was superior to the control drug ACY1215.
