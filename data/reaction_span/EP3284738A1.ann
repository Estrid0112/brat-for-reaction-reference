T1	REACTION_SPAN 51326 51375;51376 51796	1.1 Synthesis of 2-fluoro-5-iodo-benzoyl chloride 500 mg of 2-fluoro-5-iodobenzoic acid was added to a 50 ml eggplant flask, and then 3 ml of thionyl chloride was added, and heated at 77 °C for 2 hours. The reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC). After the reaction was completed, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and dried by rotary evaporation to remove thionyl chloride to give 524 mg 2-fluoro-5-iodo-benzoyl chloride as colorless liquid.
T2	REACTION_SPAN 51797 51857;51858 52430	1.2 Synthesis of 2-fluoro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-iodobenzamide 200 mg of 4-fluoroaniline was dissolved in 5 ml of ethyl acetate, and 260 µl of triethylamine was added. Then 2-fluoro-5-iodo-benzoyl chloride in ethyl acetate was added dropwise under ice-cooling, and the reaction was completed after 1.5 hours. 10ml ethyl acetate was added to dilute, and 20 ml water was added to extract. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate for three times, washed once with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and dried by rotary evaporation to obtain 620 mg 2-fluoro-N-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-iodobenzamide as light yellow solid.
T3	REACTION_SPAN 52431 52467;52468 52890	1.3 Synthesis of final product ZD001 625 mg 2-fluoro-N- (4-fluorophenyl) -5-iodobenzamide was dissolved in toluene, 1.5 eq 2-ethynylpyridine and 2.2 eq triethylamine were added followed by 0.2 eq cuprous iodide, 0.2 eq bis(triphenyl-phosphine)palladium dichloride. The mixture was heated and stirred at 100 °C for 6 hours under an inert atmosphere. The reaction liquid was dried by rotary evaporation and purified to give 460 mg ZD001 as tan solid, yield 79%.
T4	REACTION_SPAN 53096 53220;53221 53505	Example 2 The preparation of (2-chloro-5- (pyridin-2-ethynyl) phenyl) (7-oxa-2-aza-spiro [3.5] nonan-2-yl) methanone (ZD002) 2-fluoro-5-iodobenzoic acid was replaced by 2-chloro-5-iodobenzoic acid, and 4-fluoroaniline was replaced by 7-oxa-2-azaspiro [3.5] nonane, while the remaining raw materials, reagents and the preparation method were the same as those in Example 1 to give the product ZD002, yield 80%.
