BACKGROUND
The present invention relates to non-ionic aryl ketone based polymeric photo-acid generators (PAGs), and more specifically to fluorinated PAG polymers comprising aryl ketone protected sulfonate ester groups that undergo photochemically induced deprotection, generating a fluorinated polysulfonic acid for lithographic applications.
Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, combined with multiple patterning enhancements, is expected to succeed current 193 nm immersion lithography as the next generation printing technique. EUV radiation, with a shorter wavelength of 13.5 nm, is expected to achieve sub-20 nm features in a single exposure process. However, more advances in efficient light sources, EUV masks, and resists are needed for EUV lithography to become a manufacturing process.
During the last few years, considerable effort has gone into the development of resists for EUV applications. However, the majority of the EUV resists have been modified from the resists developed for 193 nm and 248 nm applications.
The highest performing photoresists for 193 nm and 248 nm applications are all based on a chemical amplification mechanism. Chemically amplified photoresists utilize a catalytic mechanism to generate a relatively large number of chemical events (e.g., deprotection reactions in the case of positive tone photoresists, or crosslinking reactions in the case of negative tone photoresists). Application of a relatively low dose of radiation induces formation of the catalyst, often a strong acid, which then catalyzes the chemical events. The current positive resist compositions comprise aqueous base soluble functional groups that are sufficiently protected with acid-labile groups so that the resist initially will not dissolve in an aqueous base developer. During exposure to radiation, the photo-acid generator (PAG) present in the resist composition produces a strong acid, which then catalyzes the removal of the acid-labile groups upon heating the exposed resist layer in a post-exposure bake (PEB). This process produces aqueous base soluble material in the exposed area, which then is selectively removed with a basic aqueous developer to produce the images.
One phenomenon that limits the resolution potential of the resists developed for 248 nm, 193 nm and E-beam applications is referred to as “image blur” (see, e.g., Hinsberg et al., Proc. SPIE, (2000), 3999, 148). Image blur is generally thought to result from two contributing factors: gradient-driven acid diffusion and reaction propagation, the result being a distortion in the developable image compared to the projected aerial image transferred onto the film. This becomes critical in EUV applications because of the need for small features with low line edge roughness (LER). Therefore, a need exists to control the gradient driven acid-diffusion in the resist films.
Most widely reported PAG-bound polymers for EUV applications are ionic in nature, having a sulfonate anion attached to the polymer and a counter ion that is a sulfonium (e.g., triphenylsulfonium) or iodonium (e.g., diphenyliodonium) cation (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,057,985 B2). This type of polymer has limitations due to low incorporation of PAG (<5 mol %), higher polydispersity, and poor solubility in casting solvents. These limitations prevent further improvements in resolution and LER.
Aryl ketone protecting groups have been used in organic synthesis as a photo-labile protecting group for carboxylic acids and in a few polymer-bound non-fluorinated photo-acid generators (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,791, U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,777, JPA H10-221852).
A continuing need exists for non-ionic PAGs, which produce strong fluorinated sulfonic acids that remain attached to the polymer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed are fluorinated non-ionic photo-acid generators (PAGs) in the form of vinyl polymerizable compounds (PAG monomers), and PAG polymers formed therefrom. The PAG monomers and PAG polymers comprise a fluorinated sulfonate ester of an alpha-hydroxy aryl ketone. The latent sulfonic acid portion and the aryl ketone ester portion of the sulfonate ester group are both fluorinated. Thus, a lithographic exposure of the PAG polymer produces a fluorinated polysulfonic acid and an unbound fluorinated residue of the aryl ketone portion of the sulfonate ester group. Also disclosed are resist compositions comprising the PAG polymers and lithographic methods of forming resist patterns therefrom. Hereinafter, it should be understood that the PAG polymers and PAG monomers are non-ionic prior to a lithographic exposure unless otherwise stated.
The PAG monomers and PAG polymers are capable of forming a sulfonic acid when exposed to radiation of wavelength less than 300 nm (i.e., between 0 nm and 300 nm), including electron beam (E-beam), extreme ultraviolet radiation (EUV, herein ultraviolet wavelengths of about 4 nm to about 124 nm), soft x-ray, x-ray, γ-ray, and/or deep ultraviolet radiation (DUV, herein ultraviolet wavelengths of 125 nm to 250 nm such as, for example, ArF excimer laser at 193 nm and KrF excimer laser at 248 nm). Preferably, the PAG monomers and PAG polymers are relatively insensitive to DUV compared to EUV. As a result, EUV exposures of resists layers comprising the PAG polymers can produce lithographic patterns having fewer defects associated with out-of-band (OOB) radiation. In an embodiment, the lithographic process utilizes an ultraviolet wavelength of 13.5 nm (EUV) to expose a resist film comprising the PAG polymer.
The PAG polymers are generally thermally stable up to at least 130° C. In an embodiment, the PAG polymers are thermally stable up to at least 160° C.
The PAG polymers can be used singularly or in combination to form a resist composition. A resist composition can comprise a PAG polymer as the sole photo-acid generating material.
The term “positive-tone development” means the exposed areas of the resist layer are selectively removed during development by a given developer. The exposed areas can become more soluble in a given developer (e.g., aqueous alkaline developer) by, for example, a non-crosslinking chemical reaction induced by the exposure that increases the polarity of the exposed areas.
The term “negative-tone development” means the non-exposed areas of the resist layer are selectively removed during development. In this instance, the exposed areas of the resist layer can become less soluble in a given developer (e.g., organic solvent developers) compared to the non-exposed areas by, for example, a crosslinking reaction or some other chemical change induced by the exposure that lowers the solubility of the exposed areas in the developer.
The term “positive-tone resist pattern” refers to the resist layer containing non-exposed resist that remains after positive-tone development. The examples further below illustrate formation of positive-tone resist patterns using the PAG polymers.
The term “negative-tone resist pattern” refers to the resist layer containing exposed resist that remains after negative tone development.
The PAG polymers can be used to form a positive-tone resist pattern or a negative tone resist pattern.

The PAG polymer can be a homopolymer, random copolymer, or block copolymer chain of the PAG repeating unit. A given PAG polymer chain can comprise the PAG repeating units singularly or in combination.
The PAG polymer comprises the PAG repeating unit in an amount of more than 0 mol %, and up to 100 mol %, based on total moles of monomers used to prepare the PAG polymer. When the PAG polymer functions as a photo-acid generator and a resin for chemical amplification, discussed in more detail below, the PAG polymer preferably comprises the PAG repeating unit in an amount of about 1 mol % to about 20 mol %, more preferably 1 mol % to 15 mol %, based on total moles of repeating units of the PAG polymer.
The PAG polymer can have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of about 100 to about 1,000,000, more particularly 1,000 to about 100,000, and even more particularly 2,000 to about 20,000, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The PAG polymer molecular weight is also discussed in more detail below.
Upon exposure to radiation (e.g., E-beam, EUV, x-ray), the PAG polymer comprising the PAG repeating unit of formula (8) is converted to a photo-acid polymer comprising a repeating unit bearing a sulfonic acid (also referred to herein as the “photo-acid repeating unit”). The photo-acid repeating unit has a structure according to formula (10):
<img> id-US20180044459A1-20180215-C00037.TIF </img>
whereinthe photo-acid polymer has a polymer backbone,A' is a trivalent radical comprising a pair of covalently linked carbons that are carbons of the photo-acid polymer backbone,L' is a single bond or a divalent C0-C10 linking group, andZ' is a divalent C1-C10 radical consisting of elements carbon, fluorine, and optionally hydrogen.
The sulfonic acid group is a strong acid capable of catalyzing a reaction (e.g., deprotection of an acid-labile group) suitable for chemical amplification in a lithographic patterning process.
Depending on the purpose of use of the PAG polymer, the PAG polymer can comprise the PAG repeating unit in combination with or without a second repeating unit containing an acid-labile group or a cross-linking site. In either instance, the PAG polymer can have any other repeating unit (referred to herein as an “auxiliary repeating unit”). The term “auxiliary repeating unit” means a repeating unit that does not correspond to the PAG repeating unit of formula (8) or formula (9) and does not correspond to the second repeating unit containing an acid-labile group or cross-linking site. The term “auxiliary monomer” means a vinyl polymerizable monomer. It should be understood that herein the term “vinyl polymerizable monomer” includes any compound comprising a polymerizable carbon-carbon double bond (e.g., vinyl aromatics (such as styrenes and vinyl naphthalenes), methacrylates, acrylates, methacrylamides, acrylamides, vinyl sulfones, vinyl ethers, vinyl esters, vinyl amides, norbornenes, maleic anhydrides, maleimides and the like) capable of forming a repeating unit of the PAG polymer. In an embodiment, the second repeating unit comprises an alcohol or carboxylic acid group protected by an acid labile group. That is, the acid labile group is capable of being removed by an acid, thereby generating the respective alcohol or carboxylic acid group, which is pendent to the deprotected PAG polymer backbone.
The PAG repeating units can be present singularly or in combination with other PAG repeating units. The second repeating units can be present singularly or in combination with other second repeating units. The auxiliary repeating units can be present singularly or in combination with other auxiliary repeating units.
Thus, the presence of the second repeating units and the auxiliary repeating units in the PAG polymer is optional. As an example, the PAG polymer can be a homopolymer of the PAG repeating unit as obtained by homopolymerization of the disclosed PAG monomer. Alternatively, the PAG polymer can be a copolymer consisting essentially of auxiliary repeating units in addition to the PAG repeating unit. In these instances, the PAG polymer cannot function as a positive resist resin capable of chemical amplification, but can function as a photo-acid generator in a resist composition comprising a second polymer resin that comprises acid-labile groups capable of chemical amplification. For such use, the PAG polymer can contain 0.1 mol % to 100 mol %, preferably 1 to 100 mol %, more preferably 2 mol % to 100 mol %, of the PAG repeating unit, the balance being one or more auxiliary repeating units. Herein, mol % of a given repeating unit is based on total moles of all repeating units of the given polymer.
Alternatively, the PAG polymer can consist essentially of the PAG repeating unit and the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site. In this instance, the PAG polymer can have properties suitable for photo-acid generation and chemical amplification in a lithographic process. The PAG polymer can comprise 0.1 mol % to 90 mol %, preferably 0.5 mol % to 50 mol %, more preferably 1 to 20 mol % of the PAG repeating unit, the balance being the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site.
If the amount of the PAG repeating unit exceeds 90 mol % of the PAG polymer, the PAG polymer can adequately function as a photo-acid generator. However, little or no benefit with respect to chemical amplification is provided by the PAG polymer comprising less than 10 mol % of the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group.
The PAG polymer can comprise i) the PAG repeating unit, ii) the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site, and iii) the auxiliary repeating unit. In this case, the PAG polymer preferably contains 0.1 mol % to 70 mol %, more preferably 1 mol % to 60 mol %, and most preferably 10 mol % to 50 mol % of the auxiliary repeating unit, 0.1 mol % to 15 mol % of the PAG repeating unit, the balance being the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site.
The PAG polymer can be used singularly or in combination with a second PAG polymer and/or PAG compound. If the amount of the PAG repeating unit is less than 0.1 mol % of the PAG polymer, a second photo-acid generator can be employed in order for the resist composition to maintain sufficient photosensitivity to high energy radiation. Substrate adhesion and etching resistance of the PAG polymer are generally adversely affected when the amount of the auxiliary repeating unit is less than 0.1 mol % of the PAG polymer. Moreover, the photo-acid generating properties of the PAG polymer and the utility of the PAG polymer as a positive or negative resist (i.e., the capability of the PAG polymer to undergo chemical amplification) are generally adversely affected when the amount of the auxiliary repeating unit exceeds 70 mol %.
When the PAG polymer functions as the photo-acid generator and a positive or negative resist resin capable of chemical amplification, the PAG polymer preferably contains 1 mol % to 15 mol % of a PAG repeating unit and 2 mol % to 85 mol % of a second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site, with the balance being the auxiliary repeating unit. More preferably, the PAG polymers contain 1 mol % to 15 mol % of the PAG repeating unit, and 4 mol % to 70% of the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site, with the balance being the auxiliary repeating unit. Most preferably, the PAG polymers contain 4 mol % to 10 mol % of the PAG repeating unit, and 15 mol % to 60 mol % of the second repeating unit containing the acid-labile group or cross-linking site, with the balance being the auxiliary repeating unit. However, the composition of the PAG polymer is not limited to the above-described ranges.
When the PAG polymer functions as both the photo-acid generating component and the base resin capable of chemical amplification, the PAG polymer can have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 1,000 to 1,000,000, more particularly 2,000 to 500,000, even more particularly 5,000 to about 15,000, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
When the resist composition is prepared with a PAG polymer and a separate base resin, the PAG polymer can have a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 1,000 to 100,000, preferably 2,000 to 50,000. If the number average molecular weight of the PAG polymer is less than 1,000, the PAG polymer can diffuse and migrate into unexposed portions of the resist film during heat treatment after pattern-wise exposure, causing deterioration in pattern resolution. Solubility of the PAG polymer in a given solvent and/or formation of uniform resist films can be adversely affected when the number average molecular weight of the PAG polymer exceeds 1,000,000.
The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn, or polydispersity index (PDI)) of the PAG polymer is preferably in the range of 1.01 to about 2.5, more preferably 1.01 to about 1.75.
When the second repeating unit contains an acid-labile group comprising a protected acid group capable of being deprotected by an acid, the PAG polymer can have dual properties of photo-acid generation and chemical amplification suitable for a positive resist composition. That is, upon exposure, the PAG polymer generates an acid that during a subsequent heat treatment catalyzes the thermal cleavage of the acid-labile groups to form additional acid groups in regions of the exposed PAG polymer, thereby altering (i.e., increasing) the solubility of the exposed PAG polymer relative to non-exposed PAG polymer in a given aqueous base developer.
When the second repeating unit contains a cross-linking site, the PAG polymer can have dual properties of photo-acid generation and chemical amplification suitable for a negative resist composition. That is, upon exposure, the PAG polymer generates an acid that during a subsequent heat treatment catalyzes a cross-linking reaction at a cross-linking site of the PAG polymer (e.g., alcohol group, carboxylic acid group), thereby altering (i.e., decreasing) the solubility of the exposed PAG polymer relative to non-exposed PAG polymer in a given aqueous base developer.
Dry etching resistance, standard developer compatibility, substrate adhesion, resist profile and other resist characteristics such as resolution, heat resistance and sensitivity can be controlled by the types and amounts of second repeating units and auxiliary repeating units used in combination with the PAG repeating units.

whereinW2 is a divalent linking group selected from the group consisting of single bond and groups comprising 1 or more carbons, andV' is *-O-H or *-(C═O)-OH.
The hydroxyl group of V' refers to a substantially neutral alcoholic hydroxyl group that is not generally involved in the dissolution of the resin into an alkaline solution but is cross-linked with a cross-linking agent by a hydroxyl-related reaction (e.g., ester bonding, ether bonding, ureide bonding, etc.) so as to make the alkali-soluble resin component insoluble in an aqueous alkali solution.

In another embodiment, the protected acid of the second repeating unit is a carboxylic acid group protected with an acid-labile functionality selected from the group consisting of tertiary esters, carbonates, acetals, ketals, and orthoesters.
Preparation of PAG Polymer
A method of forming the PAG polymer comprises i) forming a reaction mixture comprising an above-described PAG monomer (precursor to the first repeating unit of formula (11)), a solvent and a polymerization initiator, and ii) allowing the PAG monomer to polymerize, thereby forming the PAG polymer. The reaction mixture can further comprise an acid labile second monomer (precursor to the second repeating unit) and an auxiliary monomer (precursor to the auxiliary repeating unit) as co-monomers in the polymerization, thereby forming a PAG polymer that is a linear random copolymer. Herein, a “linear polymer” comprises one polymer branch and two chain ends.
No particular limitation is placed on the polymerization process for preparing the PAG polymer comprising the first repeating unit of the general formula (11). Preferably, the PAG polymer is prepared by a radical polymerization process or ionic polymerization process. Other polymerization techniques include coordination anionic polymerization, living anionic polymerization, cationic polymerization, ring opening metathesis polymerization, vinylene polymerization, vinyl addition polymerization, and living radical polymerizations (e.g., atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT)). The following describes the radical polymerization process. However, it should be understood that the polymerization reaction can be conducted using another polymerization process.
The radical polymerization process can be done by a known polymerization technique (e.g., bulk polymerization, solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, emulsion polymerization techniques) in a batch, semi-continuous or continuous mode in the presence of a radical polymerization initiator and/or a radical initiating source.
There is no particular limitation on the radical polymerization initiator. As the radical polymerization initiator, there can be used azo compounds, peroxide compounds and redox compounds. Preferred examples of the radical polymerization initiator are azobisbutyronitrile, dimethyl-2,2-azobis(2-methylpropionate), tert-butylperoxypivalate, di-tert-butyl peroxide, i-butyryl peroxide, lauroyl peroxide, succinic peroxide, dicinnamyl peroxide, di-n-propylperoxydicarbonate, tert-butylperoxyallyl monocarbonate, benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide and ammonium persulfate.
There is also no particular limitation on the reaction vessel used in the polymerization reaction. Furthermore, the polymerization reaction can be performed with the use of a polymerization solvent. As the polymerization solvent, preferred are those that do not interfere with the radical polymerization process. Typical examples of the polymerization solvent are: ester solvents such as ethyl acetate and n-butyl acetate; ketone solvents such as acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone; hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene and cyclohexane; and alcohol solvents such as methanol, isopropyl alcohol and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether. Water, ether solvents, cyclic ether solvents, fluorocarbon solvents and aromatic solvents can also be used. These solvents can be used solely or in combination of two or more thereof.
A molecular weight adjusting agent (chain transfer agent) such as mercaptan can be used in combination with the initiating agent.
The reaction temperature of the polymerization reaction is set as appropriate depending on the kind of the radical polymerization initiator or radical initiating source and is generally preferably in the range of 20 to 200° C., more preferably 30 to 140° C.
As a technique for removing water or the organic solvent from the obtained PAG polymer solution or dispersion, it is feasible to adopt re-precipitation, filtration, distillation by heating under reduced pressure, or the like.
Resist Composition
The PAG polymer comprising the PAG repeating unit is used in a resist composition in the form of a solution mixed with other components. The PAG polymer functions as a photo-acid generator. When the PAG polymer further comprises a second repeating unit having an acid-labile group or a cross-linking site and is capable of photo-acid generation and chemical amplification, the PAG polymer can serve as the sole resin of the resist composition, without the addition of a second resin having a repeating unit comprising an acid-labile group or cross-linking site. In this instance, the addition of secondary resin is optional. In the case where the PAG polymer has the PAG repeating unit but does not have the second repeating unit with the acid-labile group or cross-linking site, the resist composition is prepared with the addition of a secondary resin as an essential component to the composition. When the secondary resin is present, the secondary resin is referred to as the “base resin”. When the PAG polymer is the sole resin of the resist composition, the PAG polymer is the base resin.
The resist composition can include not only a solvent but also various additives commonly used for resist compositions such as, for example, an additive resin, a quencher, a dissolution inhibitor, a plasticizer, a stabilizer, a coloring agent, a surfactant, a viscosity improver, a leveling agent, an antifoaming agent, a compatibilizer, a primer, and/or an antioxidant. In the case of the negative resist composition, other additives such as a crosslinking agent and/or a basic compound can further be added. The additives can be used in addition to the following materials.
Base Resin
When a second resin is included in the resist composition, the second resin is referred to as the base resin. In this instance, the base resin can contain an acid-labile group so as to perform a positive resist function, or a cross-linking site so as to perform a negative resist function.
Examples of base resins for the positive resist composition are those comprising a repeating unit having a pendant carboxyl group or hydroxyl group protected by an acid-labile group on a side chain thereof, and a main chain portion derived from a polymerization of a vinyl polymerizable group, such as a repeating unit formed by polymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, α-trifloromethylacrylic acid, a vinyl group, an allyl group, and/or norbornene group.
Examples of the base resin for the negative resist composition are those comprising a repeating unit having a cross-linking site such as a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, and/or another above-mentioned functional group capable of forming a crosslink, on a side chain thereof and a main chain portion resulting from a polymerization of a vinyl polymerizable group, such as a repeating unit formed by polymerization of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, a-trifloromethylacrylic acid, vinyl group, allyl group, and/or norbornene group.
In many cases, the base resin is a copolymer for control of the resist characteristics. There are known various base resins. Herein, the above explanations of the copolymerization component, the acid-labile group, cross-linking site and linking group can be applied as they are to the base resin. As the copolymerization component of the base resin, a lactone ring-containing monomer is particularly preferred for improvement in the substrate adhesion of the resist composition.
The base resin generally has a number average molecular weight of 1,000 to 1,000,000, preferably 2,000 to 500,000, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). If the number average molecular weight of the base resin is less than 1,000, the resulting resist composition generally does not form a film with sufficient strength. If the number average molecular weight of the base resin exceeds 1,000,000, the solubility of the resin in the solvent decreases, adversely affecting the uniformity of films formed with the resist composition. The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn, PDI) of the base resin is preferably in the range of 1.01 to 3.00, most preferably 1.10 to 2.50.
Crosslinking Agents
For a negative resist composition, the cross-linking agent can be any compound formed by reacting an amino-containing compound (e.g., melamine, acetoguanamine, benzoguanamine, urea, ethylene urea, propylene urea, and glycoluril) with formaldehyde or a mixture of formaldehyde and lower alcohol, thereby substituting a hydrogen atom of the amino group with a hydroxymethyl group or a lower alkoxymethyl group. Herein, the cross-linking agents using melamine, urea, alkylene urea (e.g., ethylene urea, propylene urea, and the like) and glycoluril are hereinafter referred to as “melamine-based cross-linking agent”, “urea-based cross-linking agent”, “alkylene urea-based cross-linking agent” and “glycoluril-based cross-linking agent”, respectively. The cross-linking agent is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of melamine-based cross-linking agents, urea-based cross-linking agents, alkylene urea-based cross-linking agents and glycoluril-based cross-linking agents. Particularly preferred are glycoluril-based cross-linking agents.
Examples of the melamine-based cross-linking agents are hexamethoxymethylmelamine, hexaethoxymethylmelamine, hexapropoxymethylmelamine and hexabutoxymethylmelamine. Hexamethoxymethylmelamine is preferred.
Examples of the urea-based cross-linking agents are bismethoxymethylurea, bisethoxymethylurea, bispropoxymethylurea and bisbutoxymethylurea. Bismethoxymethylurea is preferred.
Examples of the alkylene urea-based cross-linking agents are: ethylene urea-based cross-linking agents such as mono- and/or di-hydroxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-methoxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-ethoxymethylated ethylene urea, mono- and/or di-propoxymethylated ethylene urea and mono- and/or di-butoxymethylated ethylene urea; propylene urea-based cross-linking agents such as mono- and/or di-hydroxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-methoxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-ethoxymethylated propylene urea, mono- and/or di-propoxymethylated propylene urea and mono- and/or di-butoxymethylated propylene urea; 1,3-di(methoxymethyl)-4,5-dihydroxy-2-imidazolidinone; and 1,3-di(methoxymethyl)-4,5-dimethoxy-2-imidazolidinone.
Examples of the glycoluril-based cross-linking agents are mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-hydroxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-methoxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-ethoxymethylated glycoluril, mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-propoxymethylated glycoluril and mono-, di-, tri- and/or tetra-butoxymethylated glycoluril.
The total amount of the cross-linking agent used is preferably 3 to 30 parts by mass, more preferably 3 to 25 parts by mass, most preferably 5 to 20 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the base resin of the resist composition. If the total amount of the cross-linking agent is less than 3 parts by mass of the base resin, the resist composition is generally not capable of sufficient cross-linking to form a desirable resist pattern. The resist composition can exhibit poor storage stability and/or deteriorate in sensitivity with time if the total amount of the cross-linking agent exceeds 30 parts by mass of the base resin.
Basic Compounds
The basic compound is preferably contained as an optional component in the resist composition so as to function as a quencher or to obtain improvements in resist pattern shape and post exposure stability.
Exemplary basic compounds include primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, heterocyclic amines, nitrogen-containing compounds with hydroxyphenyl group, alcoholic nitrogen-containing compounds and amide derivatives. Secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines, aromatic amines and heterocyclic amines are preferred.
The aliphatic amines can be in the form of alkylamines or alkylalcoholamines each obtained by replacing at least one hydrogen atom of ammonia (NH3) with a C1-C12 alkyl or hydroxyalkyl group. Examples of the aliphatic amines are: monoalkylamines such as n-hexylamine, n-heptylamine, n-octylamine, n-nonylamine and n-decylamine; dialkylamines such as diethylamine, di-n-propylamine, di-n-heptylamine, di-n-octylamine and dicyclohexylamine; trialkylamines such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, tri-n-propylamine, tri-n-butylamine, tri-n-hexylamine, tri-n-pentylamine, tri-n-heptylamine, tri-n-octylamine, tri-n-nonylamine, tri-n-decanylamine and tri-n-dodecylamine; and alkylalcoholamines such as diethanolamine, triethanolamine, diisopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, di-n-octanolamine and tri-n-octanolamine. Above all, alkylacoholamines and trialkylamines are preferred. More preferred are alkylalcoholamines. Among the alkylalcoholamines, triethanolamine and triisopropanolamine are particularly preferred.
Other examples of the basic compound are: aromatic or heterocyclic amines including aniline, aniline derivatives such as N-methylaniline, N-ethylaniline, N-propylaniline, N,N-dimethylaniline, 2-methylaniline, 3-methylaniline, 4-methylaniline, ethylaniline, propylaniline, trimethylaniline, 2-nitroaniline, 3-nitroaniline, 4-nitroaniline, 2,4-dinitroaniline, 2,6-dinitroaniline, 3,5-dinitroaniline and N,N-dimethyltoluidine, heterocyclic amines such as 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, hexamethylenetetramine and 4,4-dimethylimidazoline, and hindered amines such as bis(1,2,2,6,6-pentamethyl-4-piperidyl)sebacate; and alcoholic nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-hydroxypyridine, aminocresol, 2,4-quinolinediole, 3-indole methanol hydrate, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, N-ethyldiethanolamine, N,N-diethylethanolamine, triisopropanolamine, 2,2'-iminodiethanol, 2-aminoethanol, 3-amino-1-propanol, 4-amino-1-butanol, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)morpholine, 2-(2-hydroxyethyl)pyridine, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, and 1-[2-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]piperazine. The basic compounds can be used singularly or in combination.
The amount of the basic compound used is generally 0.01 to 5 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the base resin of the resist composition.
Acid Additives
In the case of the negative resist resin, an organic carboxylic acid, a phosphorus oxo acid, and/or a derivative thereof can be added as an optional component in order to prevent sensitivity deterioration caused by the addition of the basic compound and to obtain improvements in resist pattern shape and post exposure stability. This acid compound can be used singularly or in combination with the basic compound.
Exemplary organic carboxylic acid include malonic acid, citric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid and salicylic acid.
Suitable examples of the phosphorus oxo acid and its derivatives are: phosphoric acids and ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphoric acid, di-n-butyl phosphate and diphenyl phosphate; phosphonic acids and ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphonic acid, dimethyl phosphonate, di-n-butyl phosphonate, phenylphosphonic acid, diphenyl phosphonate and dibenzyl phosphonate; and phosphinic acids or ester derivatives thereof, such as phosphinic acid and phenylphosphinic acid. Phosphonic acid is particularly preferred.
Solvents
There is no particular limitation on the organic solvent as long as the PAG polymer can be dissolved in the organic solvent. Non-limiting organic solvent include: ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methyl isoamyl ketone and 2-heptanone; polyhydric alcohols and derivatives thereof, such as monomethyl ether, monoethyl ether, monopropyl ether, monobutyl ether or monophenyl ether of ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monoacetate, diethylene glycol, diethylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl etheracetate (PGMEA), dipropylene glycol or dipropylene glycol monoacetate; cyclic ethers such as dioxane; esters such as methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl pyruvate, ethyl pyruvate, methyl methoxypropionate and ethyl ethoxypropionate; aromatic solvents such as xylene and toluene; and fluorinated solvents such as fluorocarbon, hydrofluorocarbon, perfluoro compound and hexafluoroisopropyl alcohol. There can also be used a high-boiling-point weak solvent such as turpentine-based petroleum naphtha solvent or paraffin solvent for improvement in ease of application. These solvents can be used singularly or in combination.
Surfactants
Preferred surfactants for the resist composition include one or more fluorine- and/or silicon-based surfactants (i.e., fluorine-based surfactant, silicon-based surfactants, and surfactant containing both of fluorine and silicon atoms).
A resist composition comprising a surfactant is generally effective for use with an exposure light source of 250 nm or less wavelength, notably 220 nm or less wavelength and for pattern formation with a narrower pattern line width. It is possible to attain good sensitivity and resolution and obtain good resist patterning with less adhesion/development failures.
Non-Resinous Acid Generator
The resist composition can include a non-resinous photo-acid generator in combination with the PAG polymer. These include common photo-acid generators for chemically amplified resist compositions. Exemplary non-resinous photo-acid generators include bis-sulfonyldiazomethanes, nitrobenzyl derivatives, onium salts, halogen-containing triazine compounds, cyano-containing oximesulfonate compounds and other oximesulfonate compounds. These photo-acid generators can be used singularly or in combination. The amount of the photo-acid generator used, including the PAG polymer, is generally in the range of 0.5 to 20 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the resist composition. If the amount of the photo-acid generator is less than 0.5 parts by mass, the resist composition is generally not effective in forming good resist patterns. If the amount of the photo-acid generator exceeds 20 parts by mass, it is difficult to prepare the resist composition as a uniform solution. Moreover, storage stability of the resist composition decreases. The PAG polymer is generally used in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by mass, preferably 10 to 100 parts by mass, more preferably 30 to 100 parts by mass, per 100 parts by mass of the total photoacid generator content.
Additive Resins
The resin composition can include resins in addition to the PAG polymer and secondary resin (base resin). There is no particular limitation placed on the additive resin as long as the additive resin can be dissolved in the solvent used and has compatibility with the other components of the resist composition. The additive resin can function as an in-situ top coat, a plasticizer, a stabilizer, as a viscosity improver, a leveling agent, an antifoaming agent, a compatibilizer, and/or a primer.
Pattern Formation Method
The following discussion pertains to a method of patterning a desired substrate, such as, for example, a silicon wafer, a chrome-on-glass mask blank, or a printed circuit board using a resist composition comprising the PAG polymer as the base resin, (i.e., the PAG polymer comprises the photosensitive first repeating unit and acid labile second repeating unit, and is capable of photo-acid generation as well as chemical amplification by formation of acid groups). In this instance, a positive-tone lithographic pattern can be formed, as illustrated in the schematic layer diagrams of FIGS. 1A to 1E. A resist composition comprising at least the PAG polymer and a solvent is disposed on surface 12 of substrate 10 (FIG. 1A) using any suitable coating technique (e.g., spin casting) followed by removal of the solvent to form resist layer 22 of structure 20 (FIG. 1B). Resist layer 22 comprises the solid components of the resist composition. Resist layer 22 can be treated with an optional post-application bake (PAB) and/or an optional solvent rinse under suitable conditions of time and temperature before exposure. Pattern-wise exposure of resist layer 22 to high energy radiation results in exposed resist layer 32 of structure 30 (FIG. 1C). For patterning of features smaller than 40 nm it is particularly effective to use an exposure device having a light source for irradiating high energy radiation of wavelength 124 nm or less, such as EUV, x-ray, and/or E-beam.
Optionally, the resist layer can be exposed using a liquid immersion exposure device that uses a medium such as water and/or a hydrocarbon or fluorinated liquid in the optical path, which causes less absorption of high energy radiation and enables more efficient fine processing in terms of numerical aperture and effective wavelength. Most commonly, liquid immersion lithography is performed using 193 nm radiation.
Exposed resist layer 32 is composed of regions of exposed resist 34 and regions of non-exposed resist 36. Exposed resist layer 32 can be treated with an optional post-exposure bake (PEB) and/or an optional solvent rinse under suitable conditions of time and temperature before development. The exposed resist 34 and/or baked exposed resist 34 has greater solubility in an aqueous alkaline developer compared to non-exposed resist 36. Consequently, aqueous alkaline development affords a positive-tone image by removing regions of exposed resist 34. The PAB, PEB and/or solvent rinse(s) can enhance solubility differences of the exposed and non-exposed resist in a given developer. Development in an aqueous alkaline developer produces layered structure 40 comprising patterned resist layer 42 (FIG. 1D). Patterned resist layer 42 is a topographical relief pattern comprising resist features 44 composed of non-exposed resist 36. Resist features 44 are disposed on surface 46 of substrate 10 and have top surface 48 and sidewall 50. Substrate surface 52 is in contact with air. The topographical relief pattern of patterned resist layer 42 can be transferred to substrate 10 by known methods (e.g., reactive ion etching) followed by removal of resist features 44, resulting in structure 60 (FIG. 1E). Structure 60 comprises a transferred topographical pattern 62 within substrate 10, whose features 66 comprise bottom surface 64, sidewall surface 68, and top surface 70 of substrate 10.
To further illustrate a multi-layered substrate, structure 40 of FIG. 1D is reproduced as structure 70 of FIG. 2, with the exception that substrate 72 of FIG. 2 has two layers, a bottom layer 74 and an intermediate layer 76. Bottom layer 74 of substrate 72 can be, for example, a silicon wafer. Intermediate layer 76 can be, for example, an ARC layer. In this example, surface 78 is a surface of the ARC layer in contact with air, and resist features 44 are disposed on ARC surface 80.
The resist layer can be rinsed before or after the exposure, the PAB, and/or the PEB with a solvent (e.g., water, aqueous solutions, including water/alcohol mixtures, and organic solvents). Typically, the rinse is performed after the PAB. Rinses can be performed at or near room temperature (e.g., 10° C. to 50° C.) for a period of 1 second to 1 hour.
Optionally, the pre-developed resist layer and/or post-developed resist layer can be treated with water vapor and/or alcohol vapor either at room temperature or at elevated temperature on a time scale of 1 minute to 5 hours. Such a treatment after exposure and PEB can be conducted, for example, to promote additional acid induced deprotection of acid sensitive groups.
The term “substrate” refers to all underlying layers of a structure on which the resist layer is disposed. The substrate can have one or more layers arranged in a stack. In a multi-layered substrate, the layer directly below and in contact with the resist layer is the top-most layer of the substrate, also referred to as “the underlayer” to the resist layer. The terms “surface” or “underlying surface” refer to the substrate surface on which the resist layer is disposed. As non-limiting examples, the resist layer can be disposed on the surface of a silicon wafer or a metal foil, or more particularly on the surface of an anti-reflection layer (ARC) of a multi-layer substrate, where the ARC layer is the top-most layer of the substrate. In this example, the ARC layer is also the underlayer of the resist layer. In another example, the ARC layer has a polymer brush layer attached to the top surface. In this example, the polymer brush layer is also the underlayer of the resist layer.
The term “disposed” refers to a layer in contact with a surface of another layer. “Disposing” or “applying” refer to forming a layer to be in contact with a surface of another layer, without limitation as to the method employed unless otherwise stated, providing the desirable properties of the disposed or applied layer are not adversely affected (e.g., uniformity and thickness).
The term “casting” refers to forming a layer of a material by disposing a solution of the material dissolved in a solvent on a surface of another layer, and removing the solvent.
It should be understood that in some cases (e.g., when forming dense, high resolution patterns) all of the resist layer can receive some dose of radiation exposure. “Non-exposed resist” refers to resist that has received an insufficient dose to switch the solubility of the resist in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed resist (including pre-exposed resist that has been treated with an optional bake and/or optional rinse). “Exposed resist” has received sufficient exposure to switch the solubility of the resist in a given developer compared to the pre-exposed resist.
“Polarity change” implies an altered chemical composition that affects relative solubility without crosslinking. The extent of the polarity change can be measured by comparing the solubility of the exposed resist and non-exposed resist in a given developer. “Inducing a polarity change” in the resist layer means subjecting the resist layer to a treatment involving exposure, a post-exposure bake (PEB) and/or an optional rinse that alters the chemical composition of the layer such that the treated resist has a different solubility compared to the pre-treated resist in a given developer (e.g., tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) solution in water).
The optional baking (PAB and/or PEB) treatments and/or optional rinsing treatments can enhance the solubility difference of the exposed resist compared to the non-exposed resist. A PAB and/or PEB can be used to facilitate deprotection of acid sensitive protecting groups and/or elimination of reaction byproducts of the resist composition.
The optional post-application bake (PAB) treatment is typically performed at a temperature of 50° C. to 250° C. for a period of 1 second to 10 minutes, more specifically 90° C. to 130° C. for about 1 minute. The PAB can be used to dry the film of excess solvent, remove unwanted or excess organic ligand, and/or partially crosslink the resist layer. The thermally treated dry film typically will have a thickness of 0.01 micrometers to 10 micrometers, depending on the subsequent radiation source and the desired application.
The optional post-exposure bake (PEB) can be performed at a temperature of 50° C. to 300° C. for 1 second to 10 minutes, more specifically 90° C. to 130° C. for about 1 minute.
Developers
The aqueous alkaline developer for positive tone development can comprise any suitable base. Non-limiting exemplary bases include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, and various tetraalkylammonium hydroxides such as, for example, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAH). The aqueous alkaline developer can comprise one or more bases. Preferably, the aqueous alkaline developer comprises a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, more preferably tetramethylammonium hydroxide. Preferably, the TMAH developer comprises 0.1 to 5 wt % tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) based on total weight of the developer solution in water.
The aqueous alkaline developer for negative tone development can comprise any of the aqueous alkaline developers described above. The organic solvent developer for negative tone development can comprise any suitable organic solvent. Non-limiting exemplary organic solvents include ketone-based solvents, ester-based solvents, alcohol-based solvents, amide-based solvents, ether-based solvents, and hydrocarbon-based solvents. More specific organic solvent developers include methyl benzoate (MeB), ethyl 3-ethoxypropionate (EEP), 2-heptanone (MAK), 4-methyl-2-pentanone (4M2P), n-butyl acetate (NBA), propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA), anisole, acetophenone, and combinations thereof.
Post-Development Treatment
The patterned resist layer can also be given a post-development treatment, for example, to increase etch resistance. The post-development treatment can be photochemical, thermal, chemical, or a combination thereof. As an example, the patterned resist layer can be given a second exposure to a second radiation, thereby forming a treated patterned resist layer. The second exposure can be performed with a single wavelength of second radiation or a combination of suitable wavelengths (broad band) of second radiation, so long as the exposure is effective in inducing the desired response of the treated patterned resist layer. The second exposure treatment can be a flood exposure. The flood exposure can be a single conventional whole area exposure or a combination of conventional whole area exposures. The exposure treatment can also be a scanning exposure delivered by a digital writing device employing light emitting sources. The second exposure can be followed by a thermal treatment to chemically amplify the formation of chemical functional groups in the treated patterned resist layer. For example, the flood exposure can release an acid from previously unreacted photoacid generator (PAG) that upon subsequent heating catalyzes the deprotection of additional acid-sensitive carboxylic acid esters, aromatic acetals/ketals, and/or carbonates, thereby increasing the concentration of carboxylic acid and phenol groups in the treated patterned resist layer. With sufficient polarity change, the treated patterned resist layer can be rendered insoluble in either a low polarity solvent (e.g., anisole) or a more polar organic solvent, while retaining solubility in aqueous alkaline developer and/or a second organic solvent, without crosslinking the resist.
A post-development thermal treatment can further tailor the solvent compatibility, chemical structure of the resist material, and/or etch resistance of the patterned resist layer. The thermal treatment can be conducted at a temperature of 50° C. to 600° C., 50° C. to 300° C., or 50° C. to 200° C. for a period of 1 sec to 1 day.
A chemical treatment can include, for example, contacting the patterned resist layer with the vapors of a volatile Lewis acid, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, or a sulfonic acid. In each type of treatment, the chemical alteration of the resist is preferentially uniformly distributed throughout the treated resist, not just at the surface. The post-development chemical treatment can cause a chemical change in the revealed surface of the substrate, producing (after removal of the resist features) a chemically patterned surface of the substrate.
Etching includes any common etching technique applied in the manufacture of semiconductor devices, for example, dry-etching such as plasma etching, or wet-etching using selective solvents. Typically, dry etching processes are employed for etching at sub-50 nm dimensions.
Substrate
The substrate, and more particularly the surface of the substrate, can comprise inorganic or organic materials such as metals, carbon, or polymers. More particularly, the substrate can comprise any semiconducting material including, for example, Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, Ge alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP, as well as other III-V or II-VI compound semiconductors. The substrate can also comprise a layered semiconductor such as Si/SiGe, or a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI). In particular, the substrate can contain a Si-containing semiconductor material (i.e., a semiconductor material that includes Si) such as, for example, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, and quartz. The semiconductor material can be doped, undoped or contain both doped and undoped regions therein.
The following examples demonstrate the preparation of the PAG monomers, PAG polymers, resist compositions thereof, and resist patterns formed thereof. The resist formulations were not optimized.

<img> id-US20180044459A1-20180215-C00071.TIF </img>
Step A. 2,3,5,6-Tetrafluoro-4-sulfobenzoic acid (TCI, 4.28 g, 0.0156 mol) was added to a 100 mL round bottom flask along with a magnetic stir bar, followed by phosphorous pentachloride (PCl5, 8.14 g, 0.039 mol, 2.5 eq.) and phosphorous (V) oxychloride (POCl3, 2.14 mL, 0.0234 mol, 1.5 eq.). The reaction mixture was then quickly attached to a Vigreux reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet. The reaction was purged with nitrogen then heated to 90° C. for a period of 2 hours. The phosphorous salts were precipitated from the reaction mixture using dry hexanes (100 mL). The resulting cloudy white solution was filtered under nitrogen and concentrated in vacuo to give 4-(chlorosulfonyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzoyl chloride as a light yellow oil that crystallized upon standing. Analytical spectral data for this compound were consistent with previously reported data in the literature (Fielding, H. C., Shirley, I. M., “Synthesis and reactions of 4-sulpho-2,3,5,6,-tetrafluorobenzoic acid”, Journal of Fluorine Chemistry (1992), 59, 15-31).
Step B. In a 20 mL vial, 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (0.586 g, 3.53 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was neutralized with pyridine (0.571 mL, 2 eq.) in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 15 mL).

To this solution, 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (Vazo-52, 0.110 gram, 0.0005 mole) and 1-dodecanethiol (0.060 gram, 0.00030 mole) were added, and the mixture was stirred until the solids were dissolved. The resulting solution was degassed using four vacuum/nitrogen purges. The solution was then heated at 600° C. in an oil bath for 18 hours. Afterwards, the solution was added drop-wise into hexanes (400 mL). The precipitated polymer was filtered through a medium frit funnel, washed with 100 ml hexanes, and dried under suction. This polymer was then dried in a vacuum oven at 600° C. Yield: 1.96 grams. Average molecular weight: Mw 5862; Mn 4712; polydispersity (PDI): 1.24.
The polymer did not have the typical deprotection weight loss (loss of the ethyl cyclopentyl ester group) in TGA. This polymer readily dissolved in 0.26 N TMAH solution indicating carboxylic acid has formed as a result of deprotection of ECP group during polymerization. IR spectrum had a strong peak at 1699 cm1 confirming the presence of carboxylic acid functionality.
Polymer PAG Thermal Stability
Table 2 summarizes the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data for some of the PAG polymers. Td TGA (° C.) is the main decomposition temperature according to TGA. Mp DSC (° C.) is the melting point. Td DSC (° C.) is the main decomposition temperature according to DSC.

Resist Formulations
Resist compositions for non-ionic PAG polymers were prepared by forming a 3.5 wt % (weight percent) solution, based on total weight of the solution, of a given PAG polymer in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA). An organic base, 2-phenyl benzimidazole (referred to as quencher), was added to the solution in an amount of 0.33 wt % (referred to as 1× quencher) or 0.66 wt % (referred to as 2× quencher) based on total weight of the PAG polymer. The solution was then filtered through a 0.2 micrometer poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) syringe filter. The formulations were not optimized.
Line Patterns
The resist formulation was spin coated to a thickness between 30 to 50 nm onto silicon wafers having a bottom anti-reflective coating (BARC). The BARC underlayer was used for adhesion purposes. The wafer was given a post-apply bake at 110° C. for 60 seconds on a hot plate. The wafer was then exposed on a 0.3-NA extreme ultraviolet (EUV) micro exposure tool (MET) at variable doses. The exposed wafer was given a post-exposure bake at 110° C. for 60 seconds. The film thickness (FT) was nominally 40 nm. Both bakes were done with the wafer in contact with the hot plate. A 60-second development of the resist was carried out using a gentle spray of 0.26 N aqueous tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution (TMAH) to puddle followed by water rinse and spin dry. Top and cross-sectional images were inspected using a LEO Carl Zeiss scanning electron micrograph (SEM) tool. Cross sectional samples were coated with thin PdAu to avoid sample charging.
Results
FIG. 3 is a set of SEM images of line patterns of half-pitch 22 nm to 30 nm formed using PAG polymer P-1 and 1× quencher or 2× quencher. Clean lines were formed at 28 nm to 30 nm half-pitch using 1× quencher, whereas clean lines were produced at 24 nm to 30 nm half pitch using 2× quencher.
FIG. 4 is a set of SEM images of line patterns of half-pitch 26 nm to 30 nm formed using PAG polymer P-2 and 1× quencher. Clean lines were formed at 28 nm to 30 nm half pitch.
No SEM results were obtained for comparative polymer CP-1 due to decomposition of CP-1 during synthesis.
The results indicate that PAG polymers comprising sulfonate esters of alpha-hydroxy aryl ketones have commercially useful film-forming and photo-acid generating properties for lithographic applications when the sulfonate ester groups contain the above-described fluorinated R1 and Z' groups.
