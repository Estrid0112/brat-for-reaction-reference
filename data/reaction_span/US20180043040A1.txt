TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE
The present disclosure is generally related to probes and methods advantageous for detecting pyruvate kinase M2 in cells. The present disclosure is further generally related to methods of imaging tumors by detecting pyruvate kinase M2 activity using positron emission tomography (PET)-specific probes.
BACKGROUND
To sustain rapid cell division and growth, tumors undergo metabolic reprogramming. Understanding how cancer cells adjust to the metabolic needs of their unique biology has been a focus of cancer research for many years (Cairns et al., (2011) Nat. Rev. Cancer 11: 85-95). The concept of metabolic adaptation was first reported by Otto Warburg over 80 years ago, after he observed that cancer cells exhibited enhanced consumption of glucose and production of lactate in comparison to normal tissue, even under aerobic conditions (Warburg O (1956) Science 123: 309-314). This phenomenon became known as the Warburg effect. While normal, differentiated cells maximize ATP production by mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of glucose under normoxic conditions, cancer cells produce substantially less ATP from glucose using aerobic glycolysis (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513).
The enhancement in aerobic glycolysis combined with the dynamic processes in cancer cells enables glycolytic intermediates to be redirected for the biosynthetic production of cellular building blocks such as nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids, while still producing ATP (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513), therefore fulfilling the requirements for macromolecular synthesis and energy production (Vander Heiden et al., (2009) Science 324: 1029-1033; Hsu & Sabatini (2008) Cell 134: 703-707). The Warburg effect has been extensively exploited clinically to detect tumors and their response to treatment by [18F]FDG. [18F]FDG PET non-invasively measures rates of glucose metabolism and is approved for the diagnosis of most cancers and has proven particularly useful as a staging and restaging tool that can guide patient care (Kelloff et al., (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11: 2785-2808; Sharma et al., (2004) Radiographics 24: 419-434). Since glucose metabolism is an essential cellular process, [18F]FDG is not specific for malignant cells. Particularly in the brain, which has a high rate of glucose metabolism, and therefore a high physiological uptake of [18F]FDG, it is extremely difficult to delineate brain tumor margins with [18F]FDG PET imaging. There is a continuing need for PET imaging agents with selectivity for molecular processes unique to cancer cells.
Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting step in glycolysis, converting phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by transferring the high-energy phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and yielding ATP (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513). Reduced PK activity results in a diminished production of pyruvate or prevention of the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, therefore enabling the accumulation of upstream glycolytic intermediates and shifting metabolism towards the anabolic phase. Cancer cells exploit this effect by primarily utilizing the PKM2 isoform of PK, whose activity can be dynamically controlled between the less active PKM2 dimer and the highly active PKM2 tetramer (Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 230-233).
PKM2 is found in most cells with the exception of adult muscle, brain, and liver and is preferentially expressed in all cancers to date (Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 230-233). The dynamic equilibrium between the dimeric and tetrameric states of PKM2 enables proliferating tumor cells to regulate their needs for anabolic and catabolic metabolism. The alternative splicing of PKM2 is regulated by oncogenes c-Myc and HIF-1 (Chaneton & Gottlieb (2012) Trends Biochem. Sci. 37: 309-316), with the quaternary structure of PKM2 regulated by the glycolytic intermediate fructose 1,6-biphosphate (FBP) and growth factor signalling (Bailey et al., (1968) Biochem J. 108: 427-436; Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 181-186).
The expression of PKM2 has been shown to be increased in a diverse range of human cancers, including lung, breast, prostate, blood, cervix, kidney, bladder, and colon, compared to the matched normal tissues (Bluemlein et al., (2011) Oncotarget doi:10.18632/oncotarget.278). PKM2 expression is linked to increased uptake of glucose, enhanced lactate production, and a decrease in oxygen consumption, effects which can be reversed by genetic modifications to replace PKM2 expression with PKM1 (Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 230-233, Luo & Semenza (2012) Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 23: 560-566). The Warburg effect is, therefore, partly mediated by PKM2 expression, with the high expression of dimeric PKM2 in cancer cells contributing to anabolic glucose metabolism, promoting macromolecular biosynthesis and benefiting cancer cell proliferation and growth (Luo & Semenza (2012) Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 23: 560-566).
In recent years, PKM2 has been explored as a potential target for cancer therapy through the development of small molecule activators that promote and stabilize active tetramer formation (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055; lsraelsen et al., (2013) Cell 155: 397-409). Multiple classes of PKM2 activators have been developed, and representative examples are shown in FIG. 6. These examples include a series of N-N'-diaryl sulfonamides (1), thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole[3,2-d]pyridazinones (2, 3), 1-(sulfonyl)-5-(arylsulfonyl)indoline (4), 2-((1H-benzo[d]imidazole-1-methyl)-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-ones (5), 3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-5-carboxamide (6), and more recently 7-azaindole derivative (7). Clinically relevant imaging agents for the direct, non-invasive measurement of cancer-specific biomarkers are a topic of extreme interest and importance, particularly for brain tumors. Although [18F]FDG PET is approved for use for the diagnosis of most cancers, a high background uptake by surrounding healthy tissue can mask tumor uptake, for example, in the normal brain (Phelps & Mazziotta (1985) Science 228: 799). Consequently, the non-invasive measurement of PKM2 has the potential to play an important role in the detection and management of malignancies where [18F]FDG fails.
SUMMARY
The present disclosure encompasses embodiments of a non-invasive method for the detection of PKM2 expression in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors through positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the PKM2 activator, [18F]DASA-23. [18F]DASA-23 cell uptake correlates with PKM2 protein expression in cultured tumor cells and orthotopic tumors are delineated from the surrounding normal brain tissue in vivo. PET/MR imaging confirmed correspondence of the [18F]DASA-23 signal with the location of intracranial tumors. Together, these data provide the basis for imaging agents that target this important gatekeeper of tumor glycolysis.

Definitions
In describing and claiming the disclosed subject matter, the following terminology will be used in accordance with the definitions set forth below.
Unless otherwise defined, all terms of art, notations and other scientific terminology used herein are intended to have the meanings commonly understood by those of skill in the art to which this disclosure pertains. In some cases, terms with commonly understood meanings are defined herein for clarity and/or for ready reference, and the inclusion of such definitions herein should not necessarily be construed to represent a substantial difference over what is generally understood in the art. The techniques and procedures described or referenced herein are generally well understood and commonly employed using conventional methodology by those skilled in the art. As appropriate, procedures involving the use of commercially available kits and reagents are generally carried out in accordance with manufacturer defined protocols and/or parameters unless otherwise noted.
The term “cancer,” as used herein, shall be given its ordinary meaning and is a general term for diseases in which abnormal cells divide without control. Cancer cells can invade nearby tissues and can spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic system to other parts of the body. There are several main types of cancer, for example, carcinoma is cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. Sarcoma is cancer that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Leukemia is cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue, such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the bloodstream. Lymphoma is cancer that begins in the cells of the immune system.
When normal cells lose their ability to behave as a specified, controlled and coordinated unit, a tumor is formed. Generally, a solid tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue that usually does not contain cysts or liquid areas (some brain tumors do have cysts and central necrotic areas filled with liquid). A single tumor may even have different populations of cells within it with differing processes that have gone awry. Solid tumors may be benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Different types of solid tumors are named for the type of cells that form them. Examples of solid tumors are sarcomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas. Leukemias (cancers of the blood) generally do not form solid tumors. Representative cancers include, but are not limited to, bladder cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, head and neck cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, uterine cancer, and cervical cancer.
A tumor can be classified as malignant or benign. In both cases, there is an abnormal aggregation and proliferation of cells. In the case of a malignant tumor, these cells behave more aggressively, acquiring properties of increased invasiveness. Ultimately, the tumor cells may even gain the ability to break away from the microscopic environment in which they originated, spread to another area of the body (with a very different environment, not normally conducive to their growth), and continue their rapid growth and division in this new location. This is called metastasis. Once malignant cells have metastasized, achieving a cure is more difficult.
Benign tumors have less of a tendency to invade and are less likely to metastasize. Brain tumors spread extensively within the brain but do not usually metastasize outside the brain.
Gliomas are very invasive inside the brain, even crossing hemispheres. They divide in an uncontrolled manner and, depending on their location, they can be as life threatening as other types of malignant lesions. For example, a glioma can grow and occupy space within the skull, leading to increased pressure on the brain.
The term “cell or population of cells” as used herein refers to an isolated cell or plurality of cells excised from a tissue or grown in vitro by tissue culture techniques. In the alternative, a population of cells may also be a plurality of cells in vivo in a tissue of an animal or human host.
The term “contacting a cell or population of cells” as used herein refers to delivering a composition such as, for example, a probe composition according to the present disclosure with or without a pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier to an isolated or cultured cell or population of cells, or administering the probe in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to an animal or human host. Thereupon, it may be systemically delivered to the target and other tissues of the host, or delivered to a localized target area of the host. Administration may be, but is not limited to, intravenous delivery, intraperitoneal delivery, intramuscularly, subcutaneously or by any other method known in the art. One method is to deliver the composition directly into a blood vessel leading immediately into a target organ or tissue such as a prostate, thereby reducing dilution of the probe in the general circulatory system. It is contemplated that in the methods of the disclosure, administration or delivering a probe to an animal or human subject will result in the probe contacting a cell or population of cells (most advantageously a cancer cell or population of cancer cells). The probe may then enter the cell by active or passive transport.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” as used herein refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which a probe of the disclosure is administered and which is approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia or other generally recognized pharmacopeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical carriers can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea, and the like. When administered to a patient, the probes of the disclosure and pharmaceutically acceptable carriers preferably should be sterile. Water is a useful carrier when the probe of the disclosure is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers also include excipients such as glucose, lactose, sucrose, glycerol monostearate, sodium chloride, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. The present compositions advantageously may take the form of solutions, emulsion, sustained-release formulations, or any other form suitable for use.
The term “positron emission tomography” as used herein refers to a nuclear medicine imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or map of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radioisotope, which is introduced into the body on a metabolically active molecule. Images of metabolic activity in space are then reconstructed by computer analysis. Using statistics collected from tens-of-thousands of coincidence events, a set of simultaneous equations for the total activity of each parcel of tissue can be solved by a number of techniques, and a map of radioactivities as a function of location for parcels or bits of tissue may be constructed and plotted. The resulting map shows the tissues in which the molecular probe has become concentrated. Radioisotopes used in PET scanning are typically isotopes with short half-lives such as carbon-11 (11C) (about 20 min), nitrogen-13 (13N) (about 10 min), oxygen-15 (15O) (about 2 min), and fluorine-18 (18F) (about 110 min). PET technology can be used to trace the biologic pathway of any compound in living humans (and many other species as well), provided it can be radiolabeled with a PET isotope. The half-life of fluorine-18 (18F) is long enough such that fluorine-18 labeled radiotracers can be manufactured commercially at an offsite location.
The term “label” as used herein refers to any moiety that may be linked (e.g. bonded or otherwise associated with) to the compounds of the present disclosure and which may be used to provide a detectable image including PET agents such as, but not limited to, 11C, 18F, 124I and 64Cu; or SPECT agents such as,123l, 125l, or 131l.
The term “in vivo imaging” as used herein refers to methods or processes in which the structural, functional, or physiological state of a living being is examinable without the need for a life-ending sacrifice.
The term “non-invasive in vivo imaging” as used herein refers to methods or processes in which the structural, functional, molecular, or physiological state of being is examinable by remote physical probing without the need for breaching the physical integrity of the outer (skin) or inner (accessible orifices) surfaces of the body.
The term “alkoxy” as used herein refers to a linear or branched oxy-containing group having an alkyl portion of one to about ten carbon atoms, such as a methoxy group, which may be substituted. In aspects of the disclosure an alkoxy group may comprise about 1-10, 1-8, 1-6 or 1-3 carbon atoms. In embodiments of the disclosure, an alkoxy group comprises about 1-6 carbon atoms and includes a C1-C6 alkyl-O-group wherein C1-C6 alkyl has the meaning set out herein. Examples of alkoxy groups include without limitation methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, isopropoxy and tert-butoxy alkyls. An “alkoxy” group may, optionally, be substituted with one or more substitutents disclosed herein including alkyl atoms to provide “alkylalkoxy” groups, halo atoms, such as fluoro, chloro or bromo, to provide “haloalkoxy” groups (e.g. fluoromethoxy, chloromethoxy, trifluoromethoxy, difluoromethoxy, trifluoroethoxy, fluoroethoxy, tetrafluoroethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy, and fluoropropox), and “haloalkoxyalkyl” groups (e.g. fluoromethoxymethyl, chloromethoxyethyl, trifluoromethoxymethyl, difluoromethoxyethyl, and trifluoroethoxymethyl).
The term “substituted aryl” as used herein includes an aromatic ring or a fused aromatic ring system consisting of no more than three fused rings at least one of which is aromatic, and where at least one of the hydrogen atoms on a ring carbon has been replaced by a halogen, an amino, a hydroxy, a nitro, a thio, an alkyl, a ketone, an aldehyde, an ester, an amide, a lower aliphatic, a substituted lower aliphatic, or a ring (aryl, substituted aryl, cycloaliphatic, or substituted cycloaliphatic). Examples of such include, but are not limited to, aminophenyl, hydroxyphenyl, chlorphenyl, and the like.
The term “pyruvate kinase” as used herein refers to an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP, yielding one molecule of pyruvate and one molecule of ATP. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for Mg2+ and K+ cations to drive catalysis. PK functions as the last critical step in glycolysis because it is an essentially irreversible reaction under physiological conditions. In addition to its role of synthesizing one of the two ATP molecules from the metabolism of glucose to pyruvate, pyruvate kinase is also an important cellular metabolism regulator. It controls the carbon flux in lower-glycolysis to provide key metabolite intermediates to feed biosynthetic processes, such as pentose-phosphate pathway among others, in maintaining healthy cellular metabolism. Because of these critical functions, pyruvate kinase is tightly controlled at both gene expression and enzymatic allostere levels. In mammals, fully activated pyruvate kinase exists as a tetrameric enzyme. Four different isozymes (M1, M2, L and R) are expressed from two separate genes. The mammalian isozymes PKM1 and PKM2 are produced from the PKM gene (“M gene”) by alternative splicing events controlled by hnRNP proteins. The PKM2 isozyme is expressed in fetal tissues and in adult proliferating cells such as cancer cells.
Cancer cells rely primarily on glycolysis to generate cellular energy and biochemical intermediates for biosynthesis of lipids and nucleotides, while the majority of “normal” cells in adult tissues utilize aerobic respiration. This fundamental difference in cellular metabolism between cancer cells and normal cells, termed the Warburg Effect, has been exploited for diagnostic purposes but has not yet been exploited for therapeutic benefit. All tumor cells exclusively express the embryonic M2 isoform. A well-known difference between the M1 and M2 isoforms of PK is that M2 is a low-activity enzyme that relies on allosteric activation by the upstream glycolytic intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), whereas M1 is a constitutively active enzyme.
PKM2 is also expressed in adipose tissue and activated T-cells. Phosphotyrosine peptide binding to PKM2 leads to a dissociation of FBP from PKM2 and conformational changes of PKM2 from an active, tetrameric form to an inactive form. Compounds that bind to PKM2 and lock the enzyme in the active confirmation will lead to the loss of allosteric control of PKM2 needed for shunting biochemical intermediates from glycolysis into biosynthesis of nucleotides and lipids. Thus, the activation of PKM2 can inhibit the growth and proliferation of cancer cells, activated immune cells, and fat cells. Activation of PKM2 may be effective in the treatment of cancer, obesity, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, and proliferation-dependent diseases, e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
The term “activator” as used herein means an agent that (measurably) increases the activity of a pyruvate kinase (e.g., PKM2) or causes pyruvate kinase (e.g., PKM2) activity to increase to a level that is greater than PKM2's basal levels of activity. For example, the activator may mimic the effect caused by a natural ligand (e.g., FBP). The activator effect caused by the agent may be to the same, or to a greater, or to a lesser extent than the activating effect caused by a natural ligand, but the same type of effect is caused. Small molecules may be activators. An agent can be evaluated to determine if it is an activator by measuring either directly or indirectly the activity of the pyruvate kinase when subjected to the agent. The activity of the agent can be measured, for example, against a control substance. In some instances, the activity measured of the agent is for activation of PKM2. The activity of PKM2 can be measured, for example, by monitoring the concentration of a substrate such as ATP or NADH.

Discussion
Pyruvate Kinase: Pyruvate kinase (PK) catalyzes the final and rate-limiting reaction in glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by transferring the high-energy phosphate group to ADP to produce ATP. PK consists of four isoforms, of which the spliced variant, PKM2, is preferentially expressed in all cancers studied to-date, regardless of their tissue of origin (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513). PKM2 is allosterically regulated by the stabilization of a highly active tetramer relative to monomeric/dimeric PKM2. The tetramer of PKM2 has a high affinity for PEP, favoring synthesis of ATP and pyruvate, whereas the monomer/dimer has reduced activity because of its low affinity for PEP at physiological concentrations (Dombrauckas et al., (2005) Biochemistry 44: 9417-9429). When PKM2 is in the monomeric/dimeric conformation, reduced glycolytic flux through to pyruvate results in the accumulation of precursors for the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleic acids, and phospholipids, commensurate with the production of reducing power through pentose phosphate pathway-derived NADPH (Mazurek S. (2011) Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 43: 969-980). A dynamic equilibrium between the two states of PKM2 enables tumor cells to switch between anabolic and catabolic metabolism, as shown in FIG. 1A. Alternative splicing of PKM2 is controlled by c-Myc and HIF-1 oncogenes (Chaneton & Gottlieb (2012) Trends Biochem. Sci. 37: 309-316), with quaternary structure of PKM2 tightly regulated by the glycolytic intermediate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) (Bailey et al., (1968) Biochem J. 108: 427-436) and growth factor signaling (Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 181-186), as shown in FIG. 1B. In recent years, PKM2 has been targeted for cancer therapy through the development of small molecule activators that promote tetramer formation (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055; lsraelsen et al., (2013) Cell 155: 397-409).
Tumor cells reprogram their metabolism in response to the increased anabolic and catabolic demands of highly-proliferative cells. For many metabolic pathways, the balance between biomolecular synthesis and energy production is highly regulated. An elegant example is provided in the case of acetyl CoA carboxylase, which controls the opposing rates of fatty acid synthesis and oxidation on the basis of intracellular concentrations of acetyl CoA and malonyl CoA (Tong L. (2005) Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 62: 1784-1803). Altered tumor glycolysis is mediated, in part, by PKM2 through transcriptional and epigenetic means (David et al., (2010) Nature 463: 364-U114; Luo et al. (2011) Cell 145: 732-744; Lv et al. (2011) Mol. Cell 42: 719-730), with a growing body of evidence demonstrating a critical role of PKM2 in tumorigenesis and progression (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513). Further evidence suggests that PKM2 might provide a similar regulatory switch to acetyl CoA carboxylase; controlling the balance between glycolytically-derived anabolic and catabolic metabolism (Mazurek S. (2011) Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 43: 969-980; Christofk et al., (2008) Nature 452: 181-186; Eigenbrodt et al., (1992) Critical Revs Oncogenesis 3: 91-115; Vander Heiden et al., (2009) Science 324: 1029-1033). PKM2 has additionally been shown to translocate to the nucleus where it functions to promote cell proliferation through interaction with HIF, STAT 3, Oct 4 and β-catenin (reviewed in Chaneton & Gottlieb (2012) Trends Biochem. Sci. 37: 309-316).
Although of great interest and importance, non-invasive imaging of PKM2 with clinically-relevant probes and imaging modalities has not yet been reported. PKM2 is overexpressed in tumors (Wong et al., (2013) Int. J. Cell Biol. 2013: 242513) and expressed in most tissues to varying degrees, with the exception of adult muscle, brain and liver (Bluemlein et al. (2011) Oncotarget 2: 393-400; Christofk et al. (2008) Nature 452: 230-233; Imamura &Tanaka (1972) J. Biochem. 71: 1043-1051).
Given the importance of PKM2 in the regulation of tumor metabolism, there is an on-going need to non-invasively measure its expression through the development of PKM2-specific radiopharmaceuticals. A class of N,N-diarylsulfonamides (DASA) was reported by Boxer et al. in 2010 as PKM2 activators (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055), known to promote PKM2 tetramer formation through binding at the subunit interaction interface of the PKM2 dimer in an allosteric pocket that is distinct from the binding site of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, thereby inhibiting tumor growth in vivo (Anastasiou et al., (2012) Nat. Chem. Biol. 8: 839-847). The disclosure provides embodiments of precursors useful for the synthesis of novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers for the detection of the dimeric PKM2, radiolabeled [18F]DASA-23-PKM2-specific probes and related compounds, and their methods of synthesis. Accordingly, the ability of [18F]DASA-23 probe and analogs thereof are advantageous for the detection of tumor-specific PKM2 in subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of human glioma in vivo.
The present disclosure, therefore, provides PET-detectable probes that can selectively bind to the pyruvate kinase variant M2 (PKM2) that is found in cancer cells. It is further contemplated that the probes of the disclosure can be advantageously used to detect PKM2 expression in cells other than just cancer cells. In the embodiments of the radiolabeled probes of the disclosure, the radionuclide conjugated thereto is advantageously the isotope 18F. Most advantageously, the present disclosure encompasses the addition of at least one 18F moiety onto a phenyl ring of the PKM2 activator.
There is no clinically approved PET tracer that can be specifically used to visualize PKM2 expression. The PET tracer [1-((2,6-difluorophenyl) sulfon-yl)-4-(4-([11C])methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine] ([11C]DASA-23) (Witney et al., (2015) Sci. Transl. Med. 7: 310ra169) was developed to meet this need, and it was demonstrated that [11C]DASA-23 could detect tumor-specific PKM2 in subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of human glioma in vivo. These findings provided a foundation for the clinical translation of [11C]DASA-23 for the imaging of primary brain tumors and other tumors that metastasize to the brain. However, the physical characteristics of C-11 limit its clinical utility and practicality. The relatively short half-life of C-11 (t1/2=20.4 min) requires an on-site cyclotron within hospitals and imaging centers and consequently hinders the clinical application of this diagnostic radiotracer. The increasing clinical use of PET imaging and the limited availability of cyclotrons within clinical PET facilities have resulted in the development of numerous PET radiotracers labeled with F-18. The half-life of F-18 (t1/2=110 min) potentially allows remote site synthesis which has been extensively demonstrated with the world-wide use and distribution of [18F]FDG. The presence of fluorine atoms in the native structure of DASA-23, however, poses a challenge to introduce the F-18 label into its native position with nucleophilic fluorination. An advantage of radiolabelling at these native sites is that 1-((2-fluoro-6-(fluoro-18F) phenyl) sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine ([18F]DASA-23) will maintain the same binding characteristics and specificity towards PKM2 as [11C]DASA-23.
The present disclosure encompasses novel synthetic procedures for radiolabeling the PKM2 activator DASA-23 by introducing the 18F label to the novel precursor 4-((4-((2-fluoro 6-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)sulfonyl)phenol (I) (or such as 4-((4-((2,6-dinitrophenyl)sulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)sulfonyl)phenol, itself generated by a novel synthetic pathway (Scheme A). Further, since the half-life of the 18F isotope is approximately 110 min, it is advantageous for a practitioner desirous of administering the probes of the disclosure to a patient for the purposes of generating a PET image thereof to attach the radionuclide to the precursor shortly before administration. It is contemplated, therefore, that a precursor compound suitable for receiving the radionuclide and capable of specifically binding to the PKM2 variant may be provided. Methods, therefore, are provided for the generation of such a precursor and the radiolabeling of such. Most advantageously, a suitable precursor can have the formula (I).
The present disclosure further demonstrates the advantage that the PKM2-specific radiolabeled probe can surprisingly traverse the blood-brain barrier and then allow imaging of cancer cells such as gliomal cells in the brain. Accordingly, the probes of the disclosure allow methods of acquiring images, and in particular PET images, of tumors in the brain, in the prostate, and in other tissues.
Given the intrinsically low background of PKM2 in the brain, it was considered whether PKM2 is up-regulated in transformed human glioblastoma cells by using orthotopic mouse models of the disease, and whether it was possible to measure this transformation non-invasively through imaging. By using the 18F-labelled PKM2 activator 18F-DASA-23 (III), which displays selective activation of PKM2 (AC50=90 nM) versus other pyruvate kinase isozymes, PKM1, PKR and PKL (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055), high tumor cell uptake of the tracer in culture is now demonstrated, with uptake strongly correlated to PKM2 protein expression. As DASA-23 reversibly binds to PKM2, efflux of the tracer from tumor cells following removal of exogenous activity is expected, although this occurs at a relatively slow rate. Of note is the ability of [18F]DASA-23 probes of the disclosure to measure increased PKM2 expression following prolonged incubation in media (up to 72 h; FIG. 4). Cell adaptation to a reduced nutrient environment, akin to poorly perfused tumors in vivo, hints at an important role for PKM2 in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. PKM2 is degraded when glucose is abundant via acetylation and chaperone-mediated autophagy, a process which is inhibited under nutrient stress (Lv et al., (2011) Mol. Cell 42: 719-730). The ability to detect these chronically nutrient-deprived cells, through PKM2 imaging, may provide novel insights into tumor progression and metastasis, given that these cells are relatively chemoresistant (Gatenby & Gillies (2004) Nature Revs. Cancer 4: 891-899).
Given the good in vitro uptake profile and relatively high lipophilicity (c Log P=3.4, ChemDraw Bio 13.0) of [18F]DASA-23 (required for diffusion across the blood brain barrier), [18F]DASA-23 was examined for suitability for use in pre-clinical in vivo imaging of a human glioma. The combined renal and hepatobiliary excretion profile for [18F]DASA-23 (FIGS. 2 and 5), however, indicates that this probe is advantageous for the imaging of PKM2 to tumors of the brain after rapid initial uptake and washout and of the upper thoracic region. Tumor-to-muscle and blood background ratios, although statistically significant, were below those typically observed with FDG-PET (Witney et al., (2015) Clin. Cancer Res. 21: 3896-3905).
High-quality PET/CT images (FIG. 2) were obtained. Low background radioactivity was detected in normal tissue of the brain, as predicted by the absence of PKM2 expression previously measured in this tissue (Imamura & Tanaka (1972) J. Biochem. 71: 1043-1051).
The increased glucose utilization of tumors in comparison to normal tissue (the “Warburg effect”) has previously been exploited clinically to detect tumors and their response to treatment by [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET. 18F-FDG-PET is approved for use for the diagnosis of the majority of cancers (Kelloff et al., (2005) Clin. Cancer Res. 11: 2785-2808), with particular utility for detecting metastases and nodal disease that appear normal on x-ray computed tomography scans (Sharma et al., (2004) Radiological Soc. North Am. 24: 419-434). Some tumors however are not [18F]FDG-avid, e.g., prostate adenocarcinoma (Takahashi et al., (2007) Oncology 72: 226-233), whereas a high background uptake by surrounding normal tissue can mask tumor uptake, for example, in the brain (Phelps & Mazziotta (1985) Science 228: 799-809).
Accordingly, [18F]DASA-23 is useful for the non-invasive measurement of malignancies where FDG has failed. Several other radiotracers, such as 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F]fluoro-phenylalanine ([18 ]F-FDOPA) (Karunanithi et al., (2013) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. Mol. Imaging 40: 1025-1035), O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) (Weber et al., (2000) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 27: 542-549), 4-[18F]-(2S,4R)-fluoroglutamine (Venneti et al., (2015) Sci. Transl. Med. 7: 274ra217, and (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-L-glutamate ([18F]FSPG) (Baek et al., (2012) Clin. Cancer Res. 18: 5427-5437) have shown great value for imaging tumors of the brain. In contrast, the present disclosure encompasses probes directed to non-invasive measurement of PKM2 status in these tumors.
Regarding diagnostic utility, therefore, [18F]DASA-23 can be advantageously employed in the non-invasive measurement of malignancies where FDG fails. Given the great interest in targeting PKM2 for cancer therapy (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055; Anastasiou et al., (2012) Nature Chem. Biol. 8: 839-847; Vander Heiden et al., (2010) Biochem. Pharmacol. 79: 1118-1124; Walsh et al., (2011) Bioorganic Med. Chem. Letts. 21: 6322-6327), [11C]DASA-23 and the derivatives thereof as described in the present disclosure, may also provide a means to measure the therapeutic efficacy of these novel agents.
Accordingly, a PKM2-binding PET radiotracer family has been developed that enables the specific and sensitive preclinical detection of orthotopically-growing human glioblastoma. This study sets the foundation for the clinical translation of [18F]DASA-23 for the imaging of primary and metastatic gliomas. [18F]DASA-23 PET and derivatives thereof can be useful as a companion diagnostic and for the assessment of tumor aggressiveness. DASA-23 was labeled here with 11C to preserve the compound's specificity and selectivity for PKM2 binding (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055).
The present disclosure describes the synthesis and radiolabelling of ['8F]DASA-23, a PKM2 activator from the N-N'-diarylsulfonamide class of ligands, combined with its in vitro characterization using cell uptake and stability studies.
DASA-23 is advantageous for radiolabelling due to its potency as a PKM2 activator, with a maximum activating concentration (AC50) of 90 nM and also its selectivity for PKM2 relative to other PK enzymes, PKM1, PKR, and PKL (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055). This class of PKM2 activator has been described to activate the PKM2 isoform by reducing the Km (Michaelis constant) for PEP while conserving the affinity of PKM2 for ADP (Boxer et al., (2010) J. Med. Chem. 53: 1048-1055). PKM2 activators are known to bind a pocket at the PKM2 subunit interface which promotes association of PKM2 subunits into stable tetramers (Anastasiou et al., (2012) Nat. Chem. Biol. 8: 839-847). Structural analyses of activators bound to PKM2 tetramers have revealed a binding pocket present at the interface of the subunit interaction, which was distinct from the FBP binding site. Small molecular activators were found to stabilize the A-A' interface of the active tetramer, unlike FBP which stabilizes the C-C' interface (Anastasiou et al., (2012) Nat. Chem. Biol. 8: 839-847). No natural ligands have been identified for this binding site of PKM2, considering that multiple classes of activators bind this pocket; it is possible that this signifies a novel site of pyruvate kinase regulation.
It was found that [11C]DASA-23 successfully detected orthotopically growing human glioblastoma with aberrantly expressed PKM2 in mouse models. The intrinsically low background of PKM2 in the healthy brain also provided an optimal signal-to-background ratio (Witney et al., (2015) Sci. Transl. Med. 7: 310ra169). The in vivo specificity of [11C]DASA-23 for PKM2 was demonstrated through competition studies with structurally distinct PKM2 activator, TEPP-46 (Witney et al., (2015) Sci. Transl. Med. 7: 310ra169). This work sets the foundation for clinical translation of [11C]DASA-23 for the imaging of primary brain tumors and potentially other tumors that metastasize to the brain. The favorable physical characteristics of fluorine-18 (t1/2=110 min) relative to carbon-11 (t1/2=20.4 min) and the presence of fluorine atoms in the native structure of DASA-23 allowed the advantageous introduction of the F-18 label into the native position to facilitate clinical translation of this radiotracer. Labelling DASA-23 with F-18 in the native site on the molecule will not alter in any way the compound structure and therefore already established binding to PKM2.
Radiolabelling of DASA-23 was achieved by fluorine-18 nucleophilic displacement of the aryl nitro moiety within compound 10. The nucleophilic displacement by fluorine-18 of a nitro group activated by electron-withdrawing groups is a well-established and efficient method for the preparation of carrier-free F-18-labeled aromatics (Attina et al., (1983) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1983: 108-109; Attiná et al., (1983) J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 20: 501-514; Plenevaux et al., (1992) Int. J. Rad. Appl. Instrum. 43: 1035-1040). This methodology has been widely applied to the preparation of radio pharmaceuticals (a notable example being [18F]spiroperidol) and for the preparation of synthetically-useful labeled intermediates (Attiná et al., (1983) J. Labelled Comp. Radiopharm. 20: 501-514).
Radiolabelling of DASA-23 was achieved by heating the fluorination reaction at 110° C. for 20 min (precursor concentration 300 μg/ml); this afforded high purity product in sufficient yields (2.61±1.54%) for preliminary in vitro characterization. Since heating the reaction at 110° C. for 20 min afforded high purity product in sufficient yields for preliminary in vitro evaluation, no further optimizations were pursued at this stage. Evaluation of the tracer in HeLa cells showed that [18F]DASA-23 exhibited rapid and high levels of uptake and retention. Rapid uptake is necessary for [18F]DASA-23, with a half-life of 110 min, to be an effective PET tracer. The specificity of this tracer for PKM2 was confirmed by co-incubating cells with [18F]DASA-23 and TEPP-46. TEPP-46 is a structurally distinct PKM2 activator (AC50=92 nM) known to bind the same allosteric pocket as DASA-23, therefore blocking the PKM2 activator binding. This resulted in significant blocking of tracer uptake, therefore indicating that the tracer is specific and may be a suitable marker of PKM2 expression levels. In vitro stability studies revealed that [18F]DASA-23 is stable in both human and mouse serum up to 120 min. This suggests that [18F]DASA-23 may be transported to tissues in its intact form. Taken together, these data indicate that [18F]DASA-23 is advantageous as a specific radiotracer for the precise identification and visualization of PKM2 expression.
The present disclosure provides, therefore, a novel synthetic procedure towards DASA-23 that incorporates a nitro-containing precursor (FIG. 2) to be used for radiolabelling with fluorine-18. [18F]DASA-23 can then be generated via fluorination of 1-((2-fluoro-6-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine with K[18F]F/K2.2.2 (FIG. 4). In an alternative embodiment of the synthetic procedure shown in FIG. 2, instead of using 2-fluoro-6-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, it is contemplated that a 2-halogen-6-fluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride (such as 2-Bromo-6-fluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride) may be used to provide a halogen leaving group for subsequent fluoridation.
Cell culture studies showed rapid cellular uptake of the tracer in HeLa tumor cells post addition of [18F]DASA-23. Removal of tracer from the cell media resulted in some efflux of the cell-associated radioactivity, but over 50% of the tracer is still retained 30 min after removal of the [18F]DASA-23 from media. Upon addition of TEPP-46, a structurally distinct class of PKM2 activator, significant blocking of tracer uptake was observed.
In vivo, orthotopic U87 GBM tumors could be clearly delineated from the surrounding normal brain tissue by dynamic PET imaging (n=6 mice; FIGS. 12A and 12B). PET/MR co-registration confirmed precise correspondence of the [18F]DASA-23 signal with the location of the intracranial tumors, further confirmed ex vivo by autoradiography. The autoradiography results for selected coronal brain sections from both the baseline and blocking study (the latter of which was pre-treated with TEPP-46 prior to injection with [18F]DASA-23) are shown in FIGS. 12A and 12B. It is evident that [18F]DASA-23 accumulates in the tumor, with results from the blocking study clearly depicting a dramatic reduction in tumor uptake. These data highlight the specificity of [18F]DASA-23 for PKM2 and indicate that signal in the tumor is the result of tracer binding at PKM2. Together, these data demonstrate that [18F]DASA-23 successfully measures tumor-associated PKM2 in preclinical models of human GBM and provides the foundation for clinical translation of this imaging agent.

Example 7
1-((2-Fluoro-6-(Fluoro-18F)Phenyl)Sulfonyl)-4-((4-Methoxyphenyl)Sulfonyl)Piperazine ([18F]DASA-23): No carrier-added aqueous [18F]fluoride ion was produced on a PETtrace cyclotron (GE Healthcare, Sweden) by irradiation of a 1.6 ml water target using a 16 MeV proton beam on 95% enriched [18 O]H2O by the [18O(p,n)18F] nuclear reaction. [18F]Fluoride in [18O]H2O was transferred to a GE TRACERlab FXFN synthesizer and trapped on an anion exchange resin (QMA cartridge in carbonate form). [18F]Fluoride ions were then eluted into the reactor using an eluent solution containing 3.5 mg of K2CO3 and 15 mg of Kryptofix 2.2.2 (K2.2.2: 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosan) in acetronitrile (0.9 ml) and water (0.1 ml). The solution was then azeotropically dried at 65° C. under helium flow and vacuum, followed by heating at 88° C. under vacuum. Nitro precursor (10) (300 μg) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (1 ml) and added to the dry Kryptofix 2.2.2/K+[18F−] complex, and the mixture was allowed to react at 110° C. for 20 min. After cooling to 40° C., the reaction mixture was diluted with sterile water (7 ml) and passed through a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. The radiolabeled product was subsequently eluted from the C18 Sep-Pak with acetonitrile (1.5 ml) and sterile water (1.5 ml). The resulting crude mixture was then injected onto a HPLC Phenomenex Gemini C18, 5-μm (10×250 mm) semi-preparative reversed-phase column. A mobile phase of H2O (0.1% TFA)/acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) was used with a flow rate of 3.0 ml/min, and the retention time (tR) of [18F]DASA-23 was 17.8 min. The radioactive peak corresponding to [18F]DASA-23 was diluted in a round-bottom flask containing sterile water (20 ml) and then trapped on a C18 Sep-Pak. The trapped, purified radiolabeled product was eluted from the C18 Sep-Pak using ethanol (1 ml) and saline (9 ml). The formulated product was then transferred into a sterile, pyrogen-free 30-ml vial. The radiochemical yield was 2.61±1.54% (non-decay corrected at end of synthesis (EOS)) with a specific activity of 2.59±0.44 Ci/μmol (n=10) and purity greater than 95%. The chemical and radiochemical purities were determined by reversed-phase analytical HPLC Phenomenex Gemini C-18, 5 μm (4.6×250 mm). A mobile phase of H2O (0.1% TFA)/acetonitrile (0.1% TFA) was used with a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and tR of [18F]DASA-23 was 10.3 min.

Cell Uptake Studies: HeLa cells (0.5×106) were plated into 6-well plates overnight before [18F]DASA-23 uptake analysis. On the day of the experiment, fresh, prewarmed DMEM containing 25 μCi of [18F]DASA-23 was added to individual wells (1 ml per well). Cells were incubated with [18F]DASA-23 at 37° C. and 5% CO2 over a 60 min time course. For blocking studies, TEPP-46 (Cayman Chemical, 0.25 μM, at a final concentration of 0.9% DMSO) was added to Hela cells straight after [18F]DASA-23 addition and cells were incubated for 30 min. At the specified time points, incubation plates were put on ice, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (3×500 μl), and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; 500 μl). A portion of the cell lysates (200 μl) were used to determine the amount of decay-corrected radioactivity on a gamma counter (Cobra II Auto-Gamma Counter; Packard Biosciences Co.). The remaining cell lysate was used post radioactive decay for determination of protein concentration using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Additionally, 10 μl standards from the solution of [18F]DASA-23 in DMEM (25 μCi/mi) were counted to quantitate the percentage of radiotracer uptake. For efflux studies, HeLa cells were incubated with [18F]DASA-23 for 60 min and then washed with room temperature Hanks' buffered salt solution (3×500 μl ); a subsequent incubation was then completed at 37° C. in fresh, prewarmed radiotracer-free DMEM. At the specified times, samples were processed as described above.
Example 9
In Vitro Serum Stability Studies: Human and mouse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) were centrifuged at 4° C., with speed of 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Formulated [18F]DASA-23 (130-150 μCi, 20 μl volume) was added to 330 μl of supernatant. For control, the same volume of radiolabeled compound in 330 μl PBS was used. After vortexing the radiolabeled mixtures, 70 μl aliquots were incubated at 37° C. At predetermined time points (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min), 140 μl of ice-cold acetonitrile was added to corresponding samples to stop metabolism. After vortexing and centrifuging samples (10 min, 13,000 rpm), the supernatants were analyzed by analytical HPLC using the same conditions described above.
Example 10
Cell Uptake Studies: Cell culture studies showed rapid cellular uptake of the tracer in HeLa tumor cells post addition of [18F]DASA-23, with uptake values of 11.4±2.2 and 21.0±2.0% of total tracer/mg protein at 30 and 60 min, respectively (as shown in FIG. 4). Removal of tracer from the cell media resulted in some efflux of the cell-associated radioactivity with 52.8±4.8% of tracer still retained 30 min after removal of the [18F]DASA-23 from media (as shown in FIG. 5). Upon addition of TEPP-46, a structurally different class of PKM2 activator, which binds to the same allosteric site as the DASA-23 class of compounds, significant blocking (70%, p<0.01) of tracer uptake was observed (as shown in FIGS. 5-7).
Example 11
Stability Studies: In vitro plasma stability studies showed that [18F]DASA-23 was stable following incubation with either human or mouse serum at 37° C. for up to 120 min. The percentage of intact [18F]DASA-23 was 95.7 and 95.8 for respective incubation with human and mouse serum (FIG. 8).
Example 12
Chemistry: Scheme 1 (FIG. 2) illustrates the synthesis of 1-((2-fluoro-6-nitrophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine (10), the [18F]DASA-23 precursor. The synthesis begins with reaction of commercially available 4-methoxybenzenesulfonyl chloride with tert-butyl piperazine-1-carboxylate to afford inter-mediate compound 8. Cleavage of the boc-protecting group and subsequent reaction with 3-fluoro-5-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride afford the desired precursor 10 in 36% yield over three steps.
Scheme 2 (FIG. 3) describes the synthesis of cold DASA-23 standard (1) which is readily prepared via reaction of previously synthesized intermediate compound 8 with 3,5-difluorobenzenesulfonyl chloride.
Radiochemistry: [18F]DASA-23 (1) (Scheme 3) (FIG. 4) was prepared by nucleophilic displacement of the nitro group within 10 by the [18F]fluoride ion in DMF at 110° C. for 20 min. Subsequent purification by semi-preparative HPLC yielded pure [18F]DASA-23. The radiochemical yield was 2.61±1.54%, non-decay corrected at EOS, and the specific activity was 2.59±0.44 Ci/μmol (n=10). The identity of [18F]DASA-23 was confirmed by analytical HPLC coinjection with cold standard.
