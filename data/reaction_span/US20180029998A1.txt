NS-304 was invented by Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd., which had good prostacyclin (PGI2) receptor agonist activity and effects of inhibiting platelet aggregation, dilation of blood vessels, dilation of bronchial muscle, inhibiting lipid deposition and inhibiting leukocyte activation. Actelion Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd. has submitted the new drug application of NS-304 as a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug to U.S. FDA. Phase III clinical data showed that this oral drug could reduce the morbidity/mortality of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients by 39% compared with placebo.
Patent Document WO2002088084A1 first reported a preparation method of NS-304, which comprising the following steps: (1) reacting 2-chloro-5,6-diphenylpyrazine with 4-isopropylamino-1-butanol to obtain 4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]-1-butanol; (2) reacting 4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]-1-butanol with tert-butyl bromoacetate to obtain 2-{4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]butyloxy}acetic acid tert-butyl ester; (3) hydrolyzing 2-{4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]butyloxy}acetic acid tert-butyl ester to obtain 2-{4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]butyloxy}acetic acid; (4) reacting 2-{4-[N-(5,6-diphenylpyrazine-2-yl)-N-isopropylamino]butyloxy}acetic acid with 1,1-carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), then reacting with methanesulfonamide in the presence of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-7-undecene to obtain NS-304.

In this preparation method, 2-chloro-5,6-diphenylpyrazine was used as the raw material to obtain NS-304 by the multi-step reaction, the total yield was only 26%.

The reaction formula is shown below:
