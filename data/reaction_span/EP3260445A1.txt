The present invention relates to a compound, which can be used as an anti-bacterial and/or an anti-fungal agent as well as a zinc sensor. Moreover, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising said compound and methods for treating bacterial or fungal infections in mammals.
The emergence of antibiotic resistances currently pose a major threat to public health. In particular, many antibiotics cannot be further used for treating bacterial and/or fungicidal infections and resistances dramatically spread in the last years. There exists only a limited number of antibiotic classes to which most of the antibiotics belong and there further only exists a limited number of molecular targets. These factors fortify the development and spreading of resistances against multiple antibiotics.
One example of a bacterium of which multi-drug resistant strains exist is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is an important gram-negative pathogen causing many severe and life-threatening infections such as sepsis, endocarditis, meningitis, and chronic respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The increasing emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of P. aeruginosa poses major threats to public health and is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections. The pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa is mediated by its virulence factors including the enzyme elastase that causes tissue damage and degradation of host immune proteins during infection.
The Pseudomonas quinolone signals (PQS) and its precursor HHQ play important roles in the Quorum Sensing and virulence factor production of the pathogen P. aeruginosa. Many related quinolones are known as potent antibiotics and some of the medically most important are nalidixic acid, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. However, HHQ and PQS do not possess antibiotic activity and thus cannot be used as countermeasures against multi-drug resistant strains of for example P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (MRSA), which also represent a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections.
Among commercially available antibiotics only three out of ten are within a factor of two active against three tested multiresistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains (USA 300, Mu50 and DSM18827) when compared to the S. aureus strain NCTC 8325. All other antibiotics, including important drugs like erythromycin (NCTC 8325: <2 µM; USA 300: 500 µM to 1 mM; Mu50: >1 mM; DSM18827: >1mM) and clindamycin (NCTC 8325: <2 µM; USA 300: >1 mM; Mu50: 500 µM to 1 mM; DSM18827: >1 mM) require more than 10fold higher concentrations to inhibit growth of MRSA strains and in some cases even 100-1000fold higher concentrations. Thus, there still remains a high need for antibiotic compounds with new chemical structures for which substantially no resistances exist and which are preferably also effective against multi-resistant strains.
Thus, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide a compound, which can be used as an anti-bacterial and/or an anti-fungal agent, preferably an agent being effective against multiresistant strains, as well as a corresponding pharmaceutical composition and corresponding methods for treating bacterial or fungal infections in mammals.
The solution to the above technical problem is achieved by the embodiments characterized in the claims.

Preferably, zinc is in ionic form such as in the form of Zn(II).
By the method of detecting zinc according to the present invention, zinc concentrations in a test sample can be quantified by means of fluorescence spectroscopy. Means for performing fluorescence spectroscopy are not particularly limited and are known in the art. For example, standard fluorescence spectroscopy methods can be used in combination with a control sample with a given zinc concentration as a reference.
The field wherein the method of detecting zinc is used is not particularly limited. For example, the method of detecting zinc can be used in diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body, such as e.g. cancer diagnosis, for detecting the zinc concentration in e.g. blood, urine, (waste) water samples, and in neuroscience for studying e.g. synaptic zinc transport and signaling.Moreover, the method of the present invention can preferably be used for cancer diagnosis, for quantifying zinc levels by e.g. so-called "lab-on-α-chip" approaches, or as a tool in neuroscience.
Moreover, the method of detecting zinc may be conducted intracorporeal, extracorporeal, in situ, in vitro, and in vivo.
The test sample is not particularly limited. Thus, zinc can be detected in any given sample known in the art, which may optionally be solved in a medium. For example, the compound according to this aspect of the present invention can be used for quantifying zinc concentrations of samples obtained from a mammal, e.g. blood and urine samples.
Moreover, no interfering fluorescence is preferably recorded for any physiologically relevant mono-, di-, or trivalent metal cation, such as Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+. Thus, the test sample may contain any physiologically relevant mono-, di-, or trivalent metal cation apart from zinc without falsifying the result of the zinc detection.
The excitation maxima of the compound according to this aspect of the present invention are not particularly limited. For example the excitation maxima may be from 250 to 295 nm, preferably from 265 to 285 nm, from 315 to 345 nm, preferably from 330 to 340 nm, and most preferably at least one excitation maximum is from 270 to 280 nm.
The emission maximum of the compound according to this aspect of the present invention is not particularly limited. For example the emission maximum may be from 410 to 540 nm, preferably from 425 to 490 nm, and most preferably from 440 to 470 nm.
The zinc concentration in the test sample is not particularly limited. For example, the (lower) detection limit may be 2.5 µM.
A given sample may either be directly examined as the test sample or may be solved in a medium to give the test sample. The medium is not particularly limited. For example, the medium may be an aqueous medium, a medium based on one or more organic solvents, or a medium based on a mixture of water with one or more organic solvents. Preferably, the medium is obtained from one or more selected from the group consisting of water, DMSO, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, chloroform, DMF, dioxane, THF, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. More preferably, the medium is obtained from one or more selected from the group consisting of DMSO and ethanol.
In case the compound according to this aspect of the present invention is exposed to zinc ions, a strong fluorescence in organic solvents like ethanol and DMSO is observed, confirming zinc binding. Detailed excitation and emission spectra measurements gave e.g. 276 nm as excitation maximum and e.g. 448 nm as emission maximum. The compound of the present invention is enormously sensitive for zinc and significant (2fold over baseline) fluorescence is still determined at very low zinc concentrations of e.g. only 2.5 µM. The compound of the present invention is preferably a highly specific sensor compound for zinc and no interfering fluorescence is recorded for any physiologically relevant mono-, di-, or trivalent metal cation, such as Na+, Ca2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+.
Measuring zinc concentrations can be important for cancer diagnosis and zinc also plays a crucial role within the central nervous system. The compound of the present invention may thus preferably be a valuable tool to quantify zinc levels by e.g. "lab on a chip" approaches or e.g. as a tool in neuroscience.

Experimental procedures:
General
Chemicals and solvents for the synthesis were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Carl Roth or VWR Chemicals and were used without further purification. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 (DSM 19882) was purchased from DSMZ. Overnight cultures were prepared in LB medium (Lennox broth) at 37°C and 200 rpm in a glass culture tube. For Silica gel chromatography, distilled technical grade solvents and silica gel 60 Å (Carl Roth) was used. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using aluminum sheets "TLC Silica gel 60 F254" from Merck Millipore® and analyzed with UV-light, permanganate solution or an iodine chamber. NMR spectra were obtained with Bruker Avance-III 400 and Bruker Avance-III 600 NMR spectrometers at ambient temperature. Multiplicities are given as follows: s - singlet, d - doublet, t - triplet, q - quartet, quint. - quintet, m - multiplet. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in parts per million (ppm) relative to the solvent residual signal with CDCl3 δH = 7.26 ppm and δC = 77.16 ppm, DMSO-d6 δH = 2.50 ppm and δC = 39.52 ppm, THF-d8 δH = 1.72 and 3.58 ppm and δC = 67.21 and 25.31 ppm.[1] The obtained data were processed and analyzed with MestReNova or Bruker Topspin 3.5 software. Mass spectrometry data were obtained by LCMS2020 from Shimadzu (high-pressure pump LC-20 AD, auto sampler SIL-20AT HAT, column oven CTO-20AC, UV-Vis detector SPD-20A, controller CBM-20, ESI detector, software LCMS Solution, column Nucleodur 100-3-C18ec, 125 x 4 mm Machery Nagel). The method used for LCMS was a gradient with a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Mobile phase with A = H2O + 0.1% formic acid, B = acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid. Gradient over 20 min: T0: B =10%; T20: B = 95%; T25: B = 95%. For some smaller molecules, EI-MS JMS-Q1500GC from Joel Ltd. without coupled GC, the Head Space Auto Sampler (HS) and the analysis software Escrime was used. Absorption and fluorescence data were acquired with a TECAN infinite® M200 PRO plate reader using the i-control™ software and 96-well plates from Sarstedt (Microtest plates 96-well, flat-bottom, without lid) or Thermo Scientific (Microfluor® 1, 96-Well Fluorescence Microplates, flat-bottom, without lid).

<img> id-imgb0052.tif </img>
51 mg 6-F-2-heptylthiochroman-4-one (0.182 mmol) was solved in 1.1 ml MeOH and 1.4 ml EtOH in a Schleck tube with a septum under nitrogen. 75 µl Isoamylnitrite (0.55 mmol) was added and the mixture was cooled to 0°C. Under nitrogen 0.11 ml conc. HCl was added and the mixture was kept at 0°C for 10 min. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and was kept at this for 1 h. Afterwards, the reaction was heated to reflux for 3h in which the color changed from yellow to red. After the reaction time, the mixture was poured in water and extracted with ether. The combined organic phases washed twice with Brine, dried with MgSO4, filtered and the solved evaporated leaving a brown oil. The product was purified by silica gel 60 column chromatography using DCM. The product was obtained as a brown crystalline solid (m = 9.5 mg, 17 %).

For compound 3, general cytotoxicity starting above 10 µM (orange line) and inhibition of neurite outgrowth starting above 2.5 µM (green line) was observed (cf. Figure 4). In the case of compound 5 (cf. Figure 5), general cytotoxicity (orange line) and inhibition of neurite outgrowth each started above 40 µM (green line). For compound 10 (cf. Figure 6), general cytotoxicity (orange line) started at 80 µM and inhibition of neurite outgrowth started at 40 µM (green line).
Example 15: Synthesis of 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4H-thiochromene-4-thione, 1,4-S-PQS (Compound 12)
<img> id-imgb0064.tif </img>
Under nitrogen atmosphere 54.4 mg (0.197 mmol) 1-S-PQS (Compound 5) and 65.6 mg (0.295 mmol) phosphorus P2S5 were dissolved in 2.4 mL pyridine and the solution was refluxed for 4 h at 170 °C. The orange colored mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into ice. Then it was brought to pH 7 using 6 M HCl solution. The murky ochre colored suspension was extracted with DCM three times and the red colored organic layers were combined and washed with 1 M HCl solution three times. The solved crude product was dried over MgSO4, the solvent was evaporated and the red residue was recrystallized in methanol. The red precipitate was purified by silica gel chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 1:4) and the product was obtained as dark violet/black crystalline solid (41.4 mg, 72 %), Rf = 0.19 (petroleum ether/ ethyl acetate 2:1). MS(ESI): m/z calculated for C16H20OS2 + H+: 293.1 [M+H]+, found: 292.8. 1H-NMR (DMSOd6 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 0.85 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 3H, H-15), 1.21 - 1.42 (m, 8H, H-11, H-12, H-13, H-14), 1.74 (p, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H, H-10), 2.95 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H, H-9), 7.74 (ddd, J = 1.7 Hz, 7.0 Hz, 8.4 Hz, 1 H, H-6), 7.78 (ddd, J = 1.6 Hz, 7.0 Hz, 8.5 Hz, 1H, H-7), 8.10 (dd, J = 1.3 Hz, 7.5 Hz, 1 H, H-8), 8.88 (dd, J = 1.5 Hz, 8.1 Hz, 1 H, H-5), 9.38 (s, 1H, OH). 13C-NMR (DMSOd6 100 MHz) δ (ppm): 13.75 (C-15), 22.05, 31.03, 28.58 (C12-C14), 28.31 (C-11), 28.41 (C-10), 31.91 (C-9), 127.08 (C-8), 128.68 (C-6), 130.36 (C-7), 131.04 (C-2), 132.11 (C-5), 132.66 (C-8a), 135.43 (C-4a), 152.14 (C-3), 185.78 (C-4).
Example 16: In vitro inhibition of elastase (LasB) with Compounds 6, 7, and 12
An in-vitro elastase assay was performed according to Cathcart et al. (G. R. Cathcart, B. F. Gilmore, B. Greer, P. Harriott, B. Walker, Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters 2009, 19, 6230-6232). For a typical in vitro elastase assay 82 µL buffer (0.05 M TRIS HCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, pH = 7.2) and 5 µL of compound 6 solved in DMSO were added in a 96 well plate. 10 µL of 3 µg/mL elastase (solved in the same Tris/CaCl2 buffer) were added and mixed with the compound. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 3 µL fluorogenic substrate Abz-peptide-Nba (2-aminobenzoyl-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ala-4-nitrobenzylamide) in DMF were added and the fluorescence measured for 90 min in one minute steps (excitation at 330 nm, emission at 460 nm). The slope of the resulting graph was used to calculate the enzymatic activity. The in vitro assay demonstrated a strong inhibition of elastase (LasB) by Compounds 6 (IC50 = 4 µM; cf. Figure 7), 7 and 12 (both IC50 = 2 µM; cf. Figure 8).
Example 17: In situ inhibition of elastase (LasB) with Compound 6
The in situ efficacy of Compound 6 was investigated by measuring the concentration dependent inhibition of elastolytic activity with life cultures of P. aeruginosa. The elastase assay was performed according to Calfee et al. (M. W. Calfee, J. P. Coleman, E. C. Pesci, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 2001, 98, 11633-11637.) 10 µL of an overnight culture of PA14 was added to 3 mL of PTSB medium together with 15 µL of Compound 6 dissolved in DMSO at different stock concentrations. The culture was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 200 rpm. 1.4 mL of the culture was centrifuged and the supernatant filtered through a sterile filter. Thereafter, 0.5 mL ECR-buffer (0.1 M Tris HCl, 1 mM CaCl2, pH = 7.2) together with 10 mg Elastin-Congo Red was added to 0.5 ml of the sterile flow-through and the mixture incubated for 3 h at 37 °C and 1600 rpm. After the incubation, 0.1 mL Na2EDTA (0.12 M) was added to quench the enzymatic reaction. After mixing, the solution was centrifuged (10 min at 6000 rpm) and 0.2 mL of the supernatant measured at 495 nm in a 96 well plate. It was observed that Compound 6 is an efficient inhibitor of elastolytic activity in situ resulting in sigmoidal inhibition behaviour with an IC50 of 40 µM (cf. Figure 9).
Example 18: Zinc fluorescence titration
For a zinc fluorescence titration, 50 µL of Compound 6 (0.5 mM in EtOH) and 50 µl of a ZnCl2 solution (2 mM - 1 µM in EtOH) in an appropriate concentration were mixed and incubated for 5 min at room temperature in a 96 well plate. The fluorescence spectrum of the Compound 6-Zn-complex was measured from 300-600 nm at 26 °C, with an excitation wavelength of 276 nm and 25 flashes/sec (cf. Figure 10). The titration experiment reveals that zinc ion concentrations down to 2.5 µM can still be detected by fluorescence intensities two-fold over baseline.
