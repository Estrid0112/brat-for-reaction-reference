FIELD OF THIS DISCLOSURE
This disclosure relates to the field of molecules having pesticidal utility against pests in Phyla Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Nematoda, processes to produce such molecules, intermediates used in such processes, pesticidal compositions containing such molecules, and processes of using such pesticidal compositions against such pests. These pesticidal compositions may be used, for example, as acaricides, insecticides, miticides, molluscicides, and nematicides.
BACKGROUND OF THIS DISCLOSURE
“Many of the most dangerous human diseases are transmitted by insect vectors” (Rivero et al.). “Historically, malaria, dengue, yellow fever, plague, filariasis, louse-borne typhus, trypanomiasis, leishmaniasis, and other vector borne diseases were responsible for more human disease and death in the 17th through the early 20th centuries than all other causes combined” (Gubler). Vector-borne diseases are responsible for about 17% of the global parasitic and infectious diseases. Malaria alone causes over 800,000 deaths a year, 85% of which occur in children under five years of age. Each year there are about 50 to about 100 million cases of dengue fever. A further 250,000 to 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever occur each year (Matthews). Vector control plays a critical role in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. However, insecticide resistance, including resistance to multiple insecticides, has arisen in all insect species that are major vectors of human diseases (Rivero et al.). Recently, more than 550 arthropod species have developed resistance to at least one pesticide (Whalon et al.). Furthermore, the cases of insect resistance continue to exceed by far the number of cases of herbicide and fungicide resistance (Sparks et al.).
Each year insects, plant pathogens, and weeds, destroy more than 40% of all food production. This loss occurs despite the application of pesticides and the use of a wide array of non-chemical controls, such as, crop rotations, and biological controls. If just some of this food could be saved, it could be used to feed the more than three billion people in the world who are malnourished (Pimental).
Plant parasitic nematodes are among the most widespread pests, and are frequently one of the most insidious and costly. It has been estimated that losses attributable to nematodes are from about 9% in developed countries to about 15% in undeveloped countries. However, in the United States of America a survey of 35 States on various crops indicated nematode-derived losses of up to 25% (Nicol et al.).
It is noted that gastropods (slugs and snails) are pests of less economic importance than other arthropods or nematodes, but in certain places, they may reduce yields substantially, severely affecting the quality of harvested products, as well as, transmitting human, animal, and plant diseases. While only a few dozen species of gastropods are serious regional pests, a handful of species are important pests on a worldwide scale. In particular, gastropods affect a wide variety of agricultural and horticultural crops, such as, arable, pastoral, and fiber crops; vegetables; bush and tree fruits; herbs; and ornamentals (Speiser).
Termites cause damage to all types of private and public structures, as well as to agricultural and forestry resources. In 2005, it was estimated that termites cause over US$50 billion in damage worldwide each year (Korb).
Consequently, for many reasons, including those mentioned above, there is an on-going need for the costly (estimated to be about US$256 million per pesticide in 2010), time-consuming (on average about 10 years per pesticide), and difficult, development of new pesticides (CropLife America).

A particularly preferred pest group to control is sap-feeding pests. Sap-feeding pests, in general, have piercing and/or sucking mouthparts and feed on the sap and inner plant tissues of plants. Examples of sap-feeding pests of particular concern to agriculture include, but are not limited to, aphids, leafhoppers, moths, scales, thrips, psyllids, mealybugs, stinkbugs, and whiteflies. Specific examples of Orders that have sap-feeding pests of concern in agriculture include but are not limited to, Anoplura and Hemiptera. Specific examples of Hemiptera that are of concern in agriculture include, but are not limited to, Aulacaspis spp., Aphrophora spp., Aphis spp., Bemisia spp., Coccus spp., Euschistus spp., Lygus spp., Macrosiphum spp., Nezara spp., and Rhopalosiphum spp.
Another particularly preferred pest group to control is chewing pests. Chewing pests, in general, have mouthparts that allow them to chew on the plant tissue including roots, stems, leaves, buds, and reproductive tissues (including, but not limited to flowers, fruit, and seeds). Examples of chewing pests of particular concern to agriculture include, but are not limited to, caterpillars, beetles, grasshoppers, and locusts. Specific examples of Orders that have chewing pests of concern in agriculture include but are not limited to, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera. Specific examples of Coleoptera that are of concern in agriculture include, but are riot limited to, Anthonomus spp., Cerotoma spp., Chaetocnema spp., Colaspis spp., Cydocephala spp., Diabrotica spp., Hypera spp., Phyllophaga spp., Phyllotreta spp., Sphenophorus spp., Sitophilus spp.
The phrase “pesticidally effective amount” means the amount of a pesticide needed to achieve an observable effect on a pest, for example, the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and/or activity of a pest in a locus. This effect may come about when pest populations are repulsed from a locus, pests are incapacitated in, or around, a locus, and/or pests are exterminated in, or around, a locus. Of course, a combination of these effects can occur. Generally, pest populations, activity, or both are desirably reduced more than fifty percent, preferably more than 90 percent, and most preferably more than 99 percent. In general, a pesticidally effective amount, for agricultural purposes, is from about 0.0001 grams per hectare to about 5000 grams per hectare, preferably from about 0.0001 grams per hectare to about 500 grams per hectare, and it is even more preferably from about 0.0001 grams per hectare to about 50 grams per hectare.

Standard safety precautions should be exercised because an exotherm may occur when conducting this reaction.
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that, in some embodiments, the cyclopropyl acid 1-3, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9 are as previously disclosed, may be resolved into its (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers via a method such as that in Kovalenko V. N., Kulinkovich O. G. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 2011, 22, 26 (Scheme 13, step a).
In another embodiment, the cyclopropyl acid R1-3, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, and R9 are as previously disclosed, may be resolved into its (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers via a method in Scheme RI.
wherein: XR is selected from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl or benzyl.
In Scheme R1, the (±)-trans-racemate of Formula R1-1 (i.e., the mixture of (R,R) and (S,S) enantiomers of a trans-2,2-dichloro-3-(substituted phenyl)cyclopropane-carboxylic acid) is combined with a resolving agent that is either the enantiomeric amine of Formula R2-1 or Formula R2-2, in a suitable solvent, to provide the diastereomeric amine salts of Formula R3-1A or Formula R3-1B,
or of Formula R3-2A or Formula R3-2B,
that selectively crystallize or precipitate out of the resulting mixture. The diastereomeric amine salt of Formula R3-1A or Formula R3-1B, or of Formula R3-2A or Formula R3-2B, can then be isolated from the mixture and treated with an acid to provide the (1R,3R)- or the (1S,3S)-2,2-dihalo-3-(substituted phenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid of Formula R1-2A or Formula R1-2B, respectively.

Step 1: Preparation of trans-tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-(5-(3-(4-fluoro 3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-2-chlorobenzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate. Anhydrous ethyl acetate (3 mL) was added to a 10 mL glass tube containing trans-2,2-dichloro-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (C76) (0.05 g, 0.158 mmol), and tert-butyl-N-((tert-butoxy)carbonyl)-N-(3-(5-amino-2-chlorobenzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl)carbamate (C135) (0.079 g, 0.158 mmol) at room temperature. To the resulting solution were then added pyridine (0.0374 g, 0.473 mmol) and 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3P®, 50% solution in ethyl acetate; 0.201 g, 0.315 mmol). The solution was stirred at 24° C. for 12 hours, concentrated to dryness, and purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using 0-50% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent to give trans-tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-(5-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-2-chlorobenzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate as a white solid. (0.114 g, 86%).
Step 2: Preparation of trans-N-(3-amino-2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride solution (4.0 M in dioxane; 0.326 mL, 1.305 mmol) was added to a suspension of trans-tert-butyl-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-N-[3-(5-(3-(4-fluoro 3-trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-2-chlorobenzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl]carbamate (0.104 g, 0.130 mmol). The suspension was stirred at 24° C. for 12 hours. The dichloromethane was then removed under a stream of nitrogen and the sample was dissolved in ethyl acetate (20 mL) and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (5 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (5 mL). The ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification of the residue with silica gel flash chromatography using 0-50% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent provided the title compound as a white foam (0.043 g, 53%).

Example 22
Preparation of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(2,4-difluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)benzamide (F1171)
trans-2-Chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzoic acid (C12) (0.1 g, 0.22 mmol) as a slurry in toluene (2 mL) was treated with oxalyl chloride (0.0.097 mL. 1.1 mmol) and a single drop of N,N-dimethylformamide with stirring at room temperature. After the mixture became homogeneous and gas evolution ceased, the solution was concentrated to a clear oil and then cooled in an ice bath under nitrogen. 2,4-Difluoro-3-methoxyaniline (0.035 g, 0.22 mmol) was added as a solution in pyridine (2 mL) with stirring and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stir overnight.

Example 40
Preparation of cis/trans-3-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (C17)
Step 1: Preparation of (E/Z)-1-bromo-2,3-difluoro-5-(4-methoxystyryl)benzene. N-Butyllithium (2.5 Molar (M) in hexane) (3.62 mL, 9.05 mmol) was added to a stirred suspension of (4-methoxybenzyl)triphenylphosphonium chloride (3.79 g, 9.05 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) at −30° C. The resulting heterogeneous dark red mixture was stirred at −25-−30° C. for 30 minutes, followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of 3-bromo-4,5-difluorobenzaldehyde (2 g, 9.05 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (5 mL). The resulting suspension of white solid was stirred at −30° C. for another 2 hours, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for another 12 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (100 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3×50 mL). The organic extracts were washed successively with water and saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. Purification by silica gel flash chromatography provided the title compound as a clear colorless oil (1.6 g, 54%, approx. 1:1 mixture of E- and Z-stilbenes): EMS m/z 325.
Step 2: Preparation of 1-bromo-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)cyclopropyl)-2,3-difluorobenzene. To a stirred solution of (E/Z)-1-bromo-2,3-difluoro-5-(4-methoxystyryl)benzene (1.165 g, 3.58 mmol) and tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate(V) (0.139 g, 0.358 mmol) in chloroform (28.7 mL) were added sodium hydroxide powder (1.433 g, 35.8 mmol) and water (200 μL) at 23° C. The resulting mixture was vigorously stirred at 50-55° C. for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. Purification by silica gel flash column chromatography provided the title compound as a pale yellow oil (1.7 g, 63%, approx. 2:1 cis- to trans-cyclopropanes): EIMS m/z 325
Step 3. Preparation of cis/trans-3-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. Ruthenium(III) chloride hydrate (0.047 g, 0.207 mmol) was added to a stirred mixture of crude cis/trans-3-(3-bromo-4,5-difluorophenyl)-2,2-dichlorocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (1.69 g, 4.14 mmol) in water:ethyl acetate:acetonitrile (2.5:1:1, 90 mL) at 23° C. Sodium periodate (13.29 g, 62.1 mmol) was carefully added portionwise at a rate to maintain the temperature below 50° C. The resulting biphasic brown mixture was vigorously stirred at 23° C. for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (200 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in minimal acetonitrile and purified by C-18 flash chromatography to give the title compound as a grey solid (0.665 g, 44% approx. 2:1 mixture of trans/cis cyclopropanes): 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3CDCl3) δ 8.90 (s, 1H), 7.42-7.21 (m, 1H), 7.10 (dddd, J=26.8, 9.3, 6.6, 2.1 Hz, 1H), 3.35 (dd, J=49.0, 9.6 Hz, 1H), 3.01-2.77 (m, 1H); 19F NMR (376 MHz, CDCl3) δ −129.47, −129.53, −130.16, −130.21, −132.59, −132.64, −133.35, −133.41; ESIMS m/z 345 ([M−H]−).

Biological Assays
The following bioassays against Beet Armyworm (Spodoptera exigua), Cabbage Looper (Trichoplusia ni), and Yellow Fever Mosquito (Aedes aegypti), are included herein due to the damage they inflict. Furthermore, the Beet Armyworm and Cabbage Looper are two good indicator species for a broad range of chewing pests. Additionally, the Green Peach Aphid is a good indicator species for a broad range of sap-feeding pests. The results with these four indicator species along with the Yellow Fever Mosquito show the broad usefulness of the molecules of Formula One in controlling pests in Phyla Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Nematoda (Drewes et al.)
Example A
Bioassays on Beet Armyworm (Spodoptera exigua, LAPHEG) (“BAW”) and Cabbage Looper (Trichoplusia ni, TRIPNI) (“CL”)
Beet armyworm is a serious pest of economic concern for alfalfa, asparagus, beets, citrus, corn, cotton, onions, peas, peppers, potatoes, soybeans, sugar beets, sunflowers, tobacco, and tomatoes, among other crops. It is native to Southeast Asia but is now found in Africa, Australia, Japan, North America, and Southern Europe. The larvae may feed in large swarms causing devastating crop losses. It is known to be resistant to several pesticides.
Cabbage looper is a serious pest found throughout the world. It attacks alfalfa, beans, beets, broccoli, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cantaloupe, cauliflower, celery, collards, cotton, cucumbers, eggplant, kale, lettuce, melons, mustard, parsley, peas, peppers, potatoes, soybeans, spinach, squash, tomatoes, turnips, and watermelons, among other crops. This species is very destructive to plants due to its voracious appetite. The larvae consume three times their weight in food daily. The feeding sites are marked by large accumulations of sticky, wet, fecal material, which may contribute to higher disease pressure thereby causing secondary problems on the plants in the site. It is known to be resistant to several pesticides.
Consequently, because of the above factors control of these pests is important. Furthermore, molecules that control these pests (BAW and CL), which are known as chewing pests, will be useful in controlling other pests that chew on plants.
Certain molecules disclosed in this document were tested against BAW and CL using procedures described in the following examples. In the reporting of the results, the “BAW & CL Rating Table” was used (See Table Section).
Bioassays on BAW
Bioassays on BAW were conducted using a 128-well diet tray assay. One to five second instar BAW larvae were placed in each well (3 mL) of the diet tray that had been previously filled with 1 mL of artificial diet to which 50 μg/cm2 of the test molecule (dissolved in 50 μL of 90:10 acetone-water mixture) had been applied (to each of eight wells) and then allowed to dry. Trays were covered with a clear self-adhesive cover, vented to allow gas exchange, and held at 25° C., 14:10 light-dark for five to seven days. Percent mortality was recorded for the larvae in each well; activity in the eight wells was then averaged. The results are indicated in the table entitled “Table ABC: Biological Results” (See Table Section).
Bioassays on CL
Bioassays on CL were conducted using a 128-well diet tray assay. One to five second instar CL larvae were placed in each well (3 mL) of the diet tray that had been previously filled with 1 mL of artificial diet to which 50 μg/cm2 of the test molecule (dissolved in 50 μL of 90:10 acetone-water mixture) had been applied (to each of eight wells) and then allowed to dry. Trays were covered with a clear self-adhesive cover, vented to allow gas exchange, and held at 25° C., 14:10 light-dark for five to seven days. Percent mortality was recorded for the larvae in each well; activity in the eight wells was then averaged. The results are indicated in the table entitled “Table ABC: Biological Results” (See Table Section).
Example B
Bioassays on Green Peach Aphid (Myzus persicae, MYZUPE) (“GPA”)
GPA is the most significant aphid pest of peach trees, causing decreased growth, shriveling of the leaves, and the death of various tissues. It is also hazardous because it acts as a vector for the transport of plant viruses, such as potato virus Y and potato leafroll virus to members of the nightshade/potato family Solanaceae, and various mosaic viruses to many other food crops. GPA attacks such plants as broccoli, burdock, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, daikon, eggplant, green beans, lettuce, macadamia, papaya, peppers, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, watercress, and zucchini, among other crops. GPA also attacks many ornamental crops such as carnation, chrysanthemum, flowering white cabbage, poinsettia, and roses. GPA has developed resistance to many pesticides. Currently, it is a pest that has the third largest number of reported cases of insect resistance (Sparks et al.). Consequently, because of the above factors control of this pest is important. Furthermore, molecules that control this pest (GPA), which is known as a sap-feeding pest, are useful in controlling other pests that feed on the sap from plants.
Certain molecules disclosed in this document were tested against GPA using procedures described in the following example. In the reporting of the results, the “GPA & YFM Rating Table” was used (See Table Section).
Cabbage seedlings grown in 3-inch pots, with 2-3 small (3-5 cm) true leaves, were used as test substrate. The seedlings were infested with 20-50 GPA (wingless adult and nymph stages) one day prior to chemical application. Four pots with individual seedlings were used for each treatment. Test molecules (2 mg) were dissolved in 2 mL of acetone/methanol (1:1) solvent, forming stock solutions of 1000 ppm test molecule. The stock solutions were diluted 5× with 0.025% Tween 20 in water to obtain the solution at 200 ppm test molecule. A hand-held aspirator-type sprayer was used for spraying a solution to both sides of cabbage leaves until runoff. Reference plants (solvent check) were sprayed with the diluent only containing 20% by volume of acetone/methanol (1:1) solvent. Treated plants were held in a holding room for three days at approximately 25° C. and ambient relative humidity (RH) prior to grading. Evaluation was conducted by counting the number of live aphids per plant under a microscope. Percent control was measured using Abbott's correction formula (W. S. Abbott, “A Method of Computing the Effectiveness of an Insecticide” J. Econ. Entomol. 18 (1925), pp. 265-267) as follows. Corrected % Control=100*(X−Y)/X where X=No. of live aphids on solvent check plants and Y=No. of live aphids on treated plants. The results are indicated in the table entitled “Table ABC: Biological Results” (See Table Section).
Example C
Bioassays on Yellow Fever Mosquito (Aedes aegypti, AEDSAE) (“YFM”)
YFM prefers to feed on humans during the daytime and is most frequently found in or near human habitations. YFM is a vector for transmitting several diseases. It is a mosquito that can spread the dengue fever and yellow fever viruses. Yellow fever is the second most dangerous mosquito-borne disease after malaria. Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease and up to 50% of severely affected persons without treatment will die from yellow fever. There are an estimated 200,000 cases of yellow fever, causing 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Dengue fever is a nasty, viral disease; it is sometimes called “breakbone fever” or “break-heart fever” because of the intense pain it can produce. Dengue fever kills about 20,000 people annually. Consequently, because of the above factors control of this pest is important. Furthermore, molecules that control this pest (YFM), which is known as a sucking pest, are useful in controlling other pests that cause human and animal suffering.
Certain molecules disclosed in this document were tested against YFM using procedures described in the following paragraph. In the reporting of the results, the “GPA & YFM Rating Table” was used (See Table Section).
Master plates containing 400 μg of a molecule dissolved in 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (equivalent to a 4000 ppm solution) are used. A master plate of assembled molecules contains 15 μL per well. To this plate, 135 μL of a 90:10 water/acetone mixture is added to each well. A robot (Biomek® NXP Laboratory Automation Workstation) is programmed to dispense 15 μL aspirations from the master plate into an empty 96-well shallow plate (“daughter” plate). There are 6 reps (“daughter” plates) created per master. The created “daughter” plates are then immediately infested with YFM larvae.
The day before plates are to be treated, mosquito eggs are placed in Millipore water containing liver powder to begin hatching (4 g into 400 mL). After the “daughter” plates are created using the robot, they are infested with 220 μL of the liver powder/larval mosquito mixture (about 1 day-old larvae). After plates are infested with mosquito larvae, a non-evaporative lid is used to cover the plate to reduce drying. Plates are held at room temperature for 3 days prior to grading. After 3 days, each well is observed and scored based on mortality. The results are indicated in the table entitled “Table ABC: Biological Results” (See Table Section).

By way of a non-limiting example, an amine function can form salts with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, benzoic, citric, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, oxalic, succinic, tartaric, lactic, gluconic, ascorbic, maleic, aspartic, benzenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, hydroxyl-methanesulfonic, and hydroxyethanesulfonic acids. Additionally, by way of a non-limiting example, an acid function can form salts including those derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals and those derived from ammonia and amines. Examples of preferred cations include sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
Molecules of Formula One may be formulated into salt derivatives. By way of a non-limiting example, a salt derivative may be prepared by contacting a free base with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. A free base may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. As an example, in many cases, a pesticide, such as 2,4-D, is made more water-soluble by converting it to its dimethylamine salt.
Molecules of Formula One may be formulated into stable complexes with a solvent, such that the complex remains intact after the non-complexed solvent is removed. These complexes are often referred to as “solvates.” However, it is particularly desirable to form stable hydrates with water as the solvent.
Molecules of Formula One containing an acid functionality may be made into ester derivatives. These ester derivatives can then be applied in the same manner as the molecules disclosed in this document are applied.
Molecules of Formula One may be made as various crystal polymorphs. Polymorphism is important in the development of agrochemicals since different crystal polymorphs or structures of the same molecule can have vastly different physical properties and biological performances.
Molecules of Formula One may be made with different isotopes. Of particular importance are molecules having 2H (also known as deuterium) or 3H (also known as tritium) in place of 1H. Molecules of Formula One may be made with different radionuclides. Of particular importance are molecules having 14C (also known as radiocarbon). Molecules of Formula One having deuterium, tritium, or 14C may be used in biological studies allowing tracing in chemical and physiological processes and half-life studies, as well as, MoA studies.
Combinations
In another embodiment of this invention, molecules of Formula One may be used in combination (such as, in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more active ingredients.
In another embodiment of this invention, molecules of Formula One may be used in combination (such as, in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more active ingredients each having a MoA that is the same as, similar to, but more likely-different from, the MoA of the molecules of Formula One.
In another embodiment, molecules of Formula One may be used in combination (such as, in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more molecules having acaricidal, algicidal, avicidal, bactericidal, fungicidal, herbicidal, insecticidal, molluscicidal, nematicidal, rodenticidal, and/or virucidal properties.
In another embodiment, the molecules of Formula One may be used in combination (such as, in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more molecules that are antifeedants, bird repellents, chemosterilants, herbicide safeness, insect attractants, insect repellents, mammal repellents, mating disrupters, plant activators, plant growth regulators, and/or synergists.
In another embodiment, molecules of Formula One may also be used in combination (such as in a compositional mixture, or a simultaneous or sequential application) with one or more biopesticides.
In another embodiment, in a pesticidal composition combinations of a molecule of Formula One and an active ingredient may be used in a wide variety of weight ratios. For example, in a two-component mixture, the weight ratio of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient, the weight ratios in Table B may be used. However, in general, weight ratios less than about 10:1 to about 1:10 are preferred. It is also preferred sometimes to use a three, four, five, six, seven, or more, component mixture comprising a molecule of Formula One and an additional two or more active ingredients.
Weight ratios of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may also be depicted as X:Y; wherein X is the parts by weight of a molecule of Formula One and Y is the parts by weight of active ingredient. The numerical range of the parts by weight for X is 0<X≤100 and the parts by weight for Y is 0<Y≤100 and is shown graphically in TABLE C. By way of non-limiting example, the weight ratio of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may be 20:1.
Ranges of weight ratios of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may be depicted as X1:Y1 to X2:Y2, wherein X and Y are defined as above.
In one embodiment, the range of weight ratios may be X1:Y1 to X2:Y2, wherein X1>Y1 and X2<Y2. By way of non-limiting example, the range of a weight ratio of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may be between 3:1 and 1:3, inclusive of the endpoints.
In another embodiment, the range of weight ratios may be X1:Y1 to X2:Y2, wherein X1>Y1 and X2>Y2. By way of non-limiting example, the range of weight ratio of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may be between 15:1 and 3:1, inclusive of the endpoints.
In another embodiment, the range of weight ratios may be X1:Y1 to X2:Y2, wherein X1<Y1 and X2<Y2. By way of non-limiting example, the range of weight ratios of a molecule of Formula One to an active ingredient may be between about 1:3 and about 1:20, inclusive of the endpoints.
Formulations
A pesticide is many times not suitable for application in its pure form. It is usually necessary to acid other substances so that the pesticide may be used at the required concentration and in an appropriate form, permitting ease of application, handling, transportation, storage, and maximum pesticide activity. Thus, pesticides are formulated into, for example, baits, concentrated emulsions, dusts, emulsifiable concentrates, fumigants, gels, granules, microencapsulations, seed treatments, suspension concentrates, suspoemulsions, tablets, water soluble liquids, water dispersible granules or dry flowables, wettable powders, and ultra-low volume solutions.
Pesticides are applied most often as aqueous suspensions or emulsions prepared from concentrated formulations of such pesticides. Such water-soluble, water-suspendable, or emulsifiable formulations are either solids, usually known as wettable powders, water dispersible granules, liquids usually known as emulsifiable concentrates, or aqueous suspensions. Wettable powders, which may be compacted to form water dispersible granules, comprise an intimate mixture of the pesticide, a carrier, and surfactants. The concentration of the pesticide is usually from about 10% to about 90% by weight. The carrier is usually selected from among the attapulgite clays, the montmorillonite clays, the diatomaceous earths, or the purified silicates. Effective surfactants, comprising from about 0.5% to about 10% of the wettable powder, are found among sulfonated lignins, condensed naphthalenesulfonates, naphthalenesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and non-ionic surfactants such as ethylene oxide adducts of alkyl phenols.
Emulsifiable concentrates of pesticides comprise a convenient concentration of a pesticide, such as from about 50 to about 500 grams per liter of liquid dissolved in a carrier that is either a water miscible solvent or a mixture of water-immiscible organic solvent and emulsifiers. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other organic solvents may also be used, such as the terpenic solvents including rosin derivatives, aliphatic ketones such as cyclohexanone, and complex alcohols such as 2-ethoxyethanol. Suitable emulsifiers for emulsifiable concentrates are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants.
Aqueous suspensions comprise suspensions of water-insoluble pesticides dispersed in an aqueous carrier at a concentration in the range from about 5% to about 50% by weight. Suspensions are prepared by finely grinding the pesticide and vigorously mixing it into a carrier comprised of water and surfactants. Ingredients, such as inorganic salts and synthetic or natural gums may, also be added to increase the density and viscosity of the aqueous carrier. It is often most effective to grind and mix the pesticide at the same time by preparing the aqueous mixture and homogenizing it in an implement such as a sand mill, ball mill, or piston-type homogenizer. The pesticide in suspension might be microencapsulated in plastic polymer.
Oil dispersions (OD) comprise suspensions of organic solvent-insoluble pesticides finely dispersed in a mixture of organic solvent and emulsifiers at a concentration in the range from about 2% to about 50% by weight. One or more pesticide might be dissolved in the organic solvent. Useful organic solvents include aromatics, especially xylenes and petroleum fractions, especially the high-boiling naphthalenic and olefinic portions of petroleum such as heavy aromatic naphtha. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils. Suitable emulsifiers for oil dispersions are selected from conventional anionic and non-ionic surfactants. Thickeners or gelling agents are added in the formulation of oil dispersions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets.
Pesticides may also be applied as granular compositions that are particularly useful for applications to the soil. Granular compositions usually contain from about 0.5% to about 10% by weight of the pesticide, dispersed in a carrier that comprises clay or a similar substance. Such compositions are usually prepared by dissolving the pesticide in a suitable solvent and applying it to a granular carrier, which has been pre-formed to the appropriate particle size, in the range of from about 0.5 mm to about 3 mm. Such compositions may also be formulated by making a dough or paste of the carrier and molecule, and then crushing and drying to obtain the desired granular particle size. Another form of granules is a water emulsifiable granule (EG). It is a formulation consisting of granules to be applied as a conventional oil-in-water emulsion of the active ingredient(s), either solubilized or diluted in an organic solvent, after disintegration and dissolution in water. Water emulsifiable granules comprise one or several active ingredient(s), either solubilized or diluted in a suitable organic solvent that is (are) absorbed in a water soluble polymeric shell or some other type of soluble or insoluble matrix.
Dusts containing a pesticide are prepared by intimately mixing the pesticide in powdered form with a suitable dusty agricultural carrier, such as kaolin clay, ground volcanic rock, and the like. Dusts can suitably contain from about 1% to about 10% of the pesticide. Dusts may be applied as a seed dressing or as a foliage application with a dust blower machine.
It is equally practical to apply a pesticide in the form of a solution in an appropriate organic solvent, usually petroleum oil, such as the spray oils, which are widely used in agricultural chemistry.
Pesticides can also be applied in the form of an aerosol composition. In such compositions, the pesticide is dissolved or dispersed in a carrier, which is a pressure-generating propellant mixture. The aerosol composition is packaged in a container from which the mixture is dispensed through an atomizing valve.
Pesticide baits are formed when the pesticide is mixed with food or an attractant or both. When the pests eat the bait, they also consume the pesticide. Baits may take the form of granules, gels, flowable powders, liquids, or solids. Baits may be used in pest harborages.
Fumigants are pesticides that have a relatively high vapor pressure and hence can exist as a gas in sufficient concentrations to kill pests in soil or enclosed spaces. The toxicity of the fumigant is proportional to its concentration and the exposure time. They are characterized by a good capacity for diffusion and act by penetrating the pest's respiratory system or being absorbed through the pest's cuticle. Fumigants are applied to control stored product pests under gas proof sheets, in gas sealed rooms or buildings, or in special chambers.
Pesticides may be microencapsulated by suspending the pesticide particles or droplets in plastic polymers of various types. By altering, the chemistry of the polymer or by changing factors in the processing, microcapsules may be formed of various sizes, solubility, wall thicknesses, and degrees of penetrability. These factors govern the speed with which the active ingredient within is released, which in turn, affects the residual performance, speed of action, and odor of the product. The microcapsules might be formulated as suspension concentrates or water dispersible granules.
Oil solution concentrates are made by dissolving pesticide in a solvent that will hold the pesticide in solution. Oil solutions of a pesticide usually provide faster knockdown and kill of pests than other formulations due to the solvents themselves having pesticidal action and the dissolution of the waxy covering of the integument increasing the speed of uptake of the pesticide. Other advantages of oil solutions include better storage stability, better penetration of crevices, and better adhesion to greasy surfaces.
Another embodiment is an oil-in-water emulsion, wherein the emulsion comprises oily globules which are each provided with a lamellar liquid crystal coating and are dispersed in an aqueous phase, wherein each oily globule comprises at least one molecule which is agriculturally active, and is individually coated with a monolamellar or oligolamellar layer comprising: (1) at least one non-ionic lipophilic surface-active agent, (2) at least one non-ionic hydrophilic surface-active agent, and (3) at least one ionic surface-active agent, wherein the globules having a mean particle diameter of less than 800 nanometers.
Other Formulation Components
Generally, when the molecules disclosed in Formula One are used in a formulation, such formulation can also contain other components. These components include, but are not limited to, (this is a non-exhaustive and non-mutually exclusive list) wetters, spreaders, stickers, penetrants, buffers, sequestering agents, drift reduction agents, compatibility agents, anti-foam agents, cleaning agents, and emulsifiers. A few components are described forthwith.
A wetting agent is a substance that when added to a liquid increases the spreading or penetration power of the liquid by reducing the interfacial tension between the liquid and the surface on which it is spreading. Wetting agents are used for two main functions in agrochemical formulations: during processing and manufacture to increase the rate of wetting of powders in water to make concentrates for soluble liquids or suspension concentrates; and during mixing of a product with water in a spray tank to reduce the wetting time of wettable powders and to improve the penetration of water into water-dispersible granules. Examples of wetting agents used in wettable powder, suspension concentrate, and water-dispersible granule formulations are: sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate, alkyl phenol ethoxylates, and aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates.
A dispersing agent is a substance that adsorbs onto the surface of particles, helps to preserve the state of dispersion of the particles, and prevents them from reaggregating. Dispersing agents are added to agrochemical formulations to facilitate dispersion and suspension during manufacture, and to ensure the particles redisperse into water in a spray tank. They are widely used in wettable powders, suspension concentrates, and water-dispersible granules. Surfactants that are used as dispersing agents have the ability to adsorb strongly onto a particle surface and provide a charged or steric barrier to reaggregation of particles. The most commonly used surfactants are anionic, non-ionic, or mixtures of the two types. For wettable powder formulations, the most common dispersing agents are sodium lignosulfonates. For suspension concentrates, very good adsorption and stabilization are obtained using polyelectrolytes, such as sodium-naphthalene-sulfonate-formaldehyde-condensates. Tristyrylphenol ethoxylate phosphate esters are also used. Non-ionics such as alkylarylethylene oxide condensates and EO-PO block copolymers are sometimes combined with avionics as dispersing agents for suspension concentrates. In recent years, new types of very high molecular weight polymeric surfactants have been developed as dispersing agents. These have very long hydrophobic ‘backbones’ and a large number of ethylene oxide chains forming the ‘teeth’ of a ‘comb’ surfactant. These high molecular weight polymers can give very good long-term stability to suspension concentrates because the hydrophobic backbones have many anchoring points onto the particle surfaces. Examples of dispersing agents used in agrochemical formulations are: sodium lignosulfonates, sodium naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensates, tristyrylphenol-ethoxylate-phosphate-esters, aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates, alkyl ethoxylates, EO-PO block copolymers, and graft copolymers.
An emulsifying agent is a substance that stabilizes a suspension of droplets of one liquid phase in another liquid phase. Without the emulsifying agent, the two liquids would separate into two immiscible liquid phases. The most commonly used emulsifier blends contain an alkylphenol or an aliphatic alcohol with twelve or more ethylene oxide units and the oil-soluble calcium salt of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid. A range of hydrophile-lipophile balance (“HLB”) values from about 8 to about 18 will normally provide good stable emulsions. Emulsion stability can sometimes be improved by the addition of a small amount of an EO-PO block copolymer surfactant.
A solubilizing agent is a surfactant that will form micelles in water at concentrations above the critical micelle concentration. The micelles are then able to dissolve or solubilize water-insoluble materials inside the hydrophobic part of the micelle. The types of surfactants usually used for solubilization are non-ionics, sorbitan monooleates, sorbitan monooleate ethoxylates, and methyl oleate esters.
Surfactants are sometimes used, either alone or with other additives such as mineral or vegetable oils as adjuvants to spray-tank mixes to improve the biological performance of the pesticide on the target. The types of surfactants used for bioenhancement depend generally on the nature and mode of action of the pesticide. However, they are often non-ionics such as: alkyl ethoxylates, linear aliphatic alcohol ethoxylates, and aliphatic amine ethoxylates.
A carrier or diluent in an agricultural formulation is a material added to the pesticide to give a product of the required strength. Carriers are usually materials with high absorptive capacities, while diluents are usually materials with low absorptive capacities. Carriers and diluents are used in the formulation of dusts, wettable powders, granules, and water-dispersible granules.
Organic solvents are used mainly in the formulation of emulsifiable concentrates, oil-in-water emulsions, suspoemulsions, oil dispersions, and ultra-low volume formulations, and to a lesser extent, granular formulations. Sometimes mixtures of solvents are used. The first main groups of solvents are aliphatic paraffinic oils such as kerosene or refined paraffins. The second main group and the most common) comprises the aromatic solvents such as xylene and higher molecular weight fractions of C9 and C10 aromatic solvents. Chlorinated hydrocarbons are useful as cosolvents to prevent crystallization of pesticides when the formulation is emulsified into water. Alcohols are sometimes used as cosolvents to increase solvent power. Other solvents may include vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters of vegetable and seed oils.
Thickeners or gelling agents are used mainly in the formulation of suspension concentrates, oil dispersions, emulsions and suspoemulsions to modify the rheology or flow properties of the liquid and to prevent separation and settling of the dispersed particles or droplets. Thickening, gelling, and anti-settling agents generally fall into two categories, namely water-insoluble particulates and water-soluble polymers. It is possible to produce suspension concentrate and oil dispersion formulations using clays and silicas. Examples of these types of materials, include, but are not limited to, montmorillonite, bentonite, magnesium aluminum silicate, and attapulgite. Water-soluble polysaccharides in water based suspension concentrates have been used as thickening-gelling agents for many years. The types of polysaccharides most commonly used are natural extracts of seeds and seaweeds or are synthetic derivatives of cellulose. Examples of these types of materials include, but are not limited to, guar gum, locust bean gum, carrageenam, alginates, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC), and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC). Other types of anti-settling agents are based on modified starches, polyacrylates, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyethylene oxide. Another good anti-settling agent is xanthan gum.
Microorganisms can cause spoilage of formulated products. Therefore, preservation agents are used to eliminate or reduce their effect. Examples of such agents include, but are not limited to: propionic acid and its sodium salt, sorbic acid and its sodium or potassium salts, benzoic acid and its sodium salt, p-hydroxybenzoic acid sodium salt, methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, and 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT).
The presence of surfactants often causes water-based formulations to foam during mixing operations in production and in application through a spray tank. In order to reduce the tendency to foam, anti-foam agents are often added either during the production stage or before filling into bottles. Generally, there are two types of anti-foam agents, namely silicones and non-silicones. Silicones are usually aqueous emulsions of dimethyl polysiloxane, while the non-silicone anti-foam agents are water-insoluble oils, such as octanol and nonanol, or silica. In both cases, the function of the anti-foam agent is to displace the surfactant from the air-water interface.
“Green” agents (e.g., adjuvants, surfactants, solvents) can reduce the overall environmental footprint of crop protection formulations. Green agents are biodegradable and generally derived from natural and/or sustainable sources, e.g. plant and animal sources. Specific examples are: vegetable oils, seed oils, and esters thereof, also alkoxylated alkyl polyglucosides.
Applications
Molecules of Formula One may be applied to any locus. Particular loci to apply such molecules include loci where alfalfa, almonds, apples, barley, beans, canola, corn, cotton, crucifers, flowers, fodder species (Rye Grass, Sudan Grass, Tail Fescue, Kentucky Blue Grass, and Clover), fruits, lettuce, oats, oil seed crops, oranges, peanuts, pears, peppers, potatoes, rice, sorghum, soybeans, strawberries, sugarcane, sugarbeets, sunflowers, tobacco, tomatoes, wheat (for example, Hard Red Winter Wheat, Soft Red Winter Wheat, White Winter Wheat, Hard Red Spring Wheat, and Durum Spring Wheat), and other valuable crops are growing or the seeds thereof are going to be planted.
Molecules of Formula One may also be applied where plants, such as crops, are growing and where there are low levels (even no actual presence) of pests that can commercially damage such plants. Applying such molecules in such locus is to benefit the plants being grown in such locus. Such benefits, may include, but are not limited to: helping the plant grow a better root system; helping the plant better withstand stressful growing conditions; improving the health of a plant; improving the yield of a plant (e.g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients); improving the vigor of a plant (e.g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves); improving the quality of a plant (e.g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients); and improving the tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress of the plant.
Molecules of Formula One may be applied with ammonium sulfate when growing various plants as this may provide additional benefits.
Molecules of Formula One may be applied on, in, or around plants genetically modified to express specialized traits, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (for example, Cry1Ab, Cry1Ac, Cry1Fa, Cry1A.105, Cry2Ab, Vip3A, mCry3A, Cry3Ab, Cry3Bb, Cry34Ab1/Cry35Ab1), other insecticidal toxins, or those expressing herbicide tolerance, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide tolerance, nutrition-enhancement, or any other beneficial traits.
Molecules of Formula One may be applied to the foliar and/or fruiting portions of plants to control pests. Either such molecules will come in direct contact with the pest, or the pest will consume such molecules when eating the plant or while extracting sap or other nutrients from the plant.
Molecules of Formula One may also be applied to the soil, and when applied in this manner, root and stem feeding pests may be controlled. The roots may absorb such molecules thereby taking it up into the foliar portions of the plant to control above ground chewing and sap feeding pests.
Systemic movement of pesticides in plants may be utilized to control pests on one portion of the plant by applying (for example by spraying a locus) a molecule of Formula One to a different portion of the plant. For example, control of foliar-feeding insects may be achieved by drip irrigation or furrow application, by treating the soil with for example pre- or post-planting soil drench, or by treating the seeds of a plant before planting.
Molecules of Formula One may be used with baits. Generally, with baits, the baits are placed in the ground where, for example, termites can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait. Baits can also be applied to a surface of a building, (horizontal, vertical, or slant surface) where, for example, ants, termites, cockroaches, and flies, can come into contact with, and/or be attracted to, the bait.
Molecules of Formula One may be encapsulated inside, or placed on the surface of a capsule. The size of the capsules can range from nanometer size (about 100-900 nanometers in diameter) to micrometer size (about 10-900 microns in diameter).
Molecules of Formula One may be applied to eggs of pests. Because of the unique ability of the eggs of some pests to resist certain pesticides, repeated applications of such molecules may be desirable to control newly emerged larvae.
Molecules of Formula One may be applied as seed treatments. Seed treatments may be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically modified to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis or other insecticidal toxins, those expressing herbicide tolerance, such as “Roundup Ready” seed, or those with “stacked” foreign genes expressing insecticidal toxins, herbicide tolerance, nutrition-enhancement, drought tolerance, or any other beneficial traits. Furthermore, such seed treatments with molecules of Formula One may further enhance the ability of a plant to withstand stressful growing conditions better. This results in a healthier, more vigorous plant, which can lead to higher yields at harvest time. Generally, about 1 gram of such molecules to about 500 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide good benefits, amounts from about 10 grams to about 100 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide better benefits, and amounts from about 25 grams to about 75 grams per 100,000 seeds is expected to provide even better benefits. Molecules of Formula One may be applied with one or more active ingredients in a soil amendment.
Molecules of Formula One may be used for controlling endoparasites and ectoparasites in the veterinary medicine sector or in the field of non-human-animal keeping. Such molecules may be applied by oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, by dermal application in the form of, for example, dipping, spraying, pouring on, spotting on, and dusting, and by parenteral administration in the form of, for example, an injection.
Molecules of Formula One may also be employed advantageously in livestock keeping, for example, cattle, chickens, geese, goats, pigs, sheep, and turkeys. They may also be employed advantageously in pets such as, horses, dogs, and cats. Particular pests to control would be flies, fleas, and ticks that are bothersome to such animals. Suitable formulations are administered orally to the animals with the drinking water or feed. The dosages and formulations that are suitable depend on the species.
Molecules of Formula One may also be used for controlling parasitic worms, especially of the intestine, in the animals listed above.
Molecules of Formula One may also be employed in therapeutic methods for human health care. Such methods include, but are limited to, oral administration in the form of, for example, tablets, capsules, drinks, granules, and by dermal application.
Molecules of Formula One may also be applied to invasive pests. Pests around the world have been migrating to new environments (for such pest) and thereafter becoming a new invasive species in such new environment. Such molecules may also be used on such new invasive species to control them in such new environments.
