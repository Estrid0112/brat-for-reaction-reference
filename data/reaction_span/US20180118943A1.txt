TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent probe and to a method for measuring acidic regions within cells using the same.
BACKGROUND ART
Cells carry out a variety of biochemical reactions, such as metabolism of proteins and organic compounds taken up, and synthesis and transport of cell structural components, at high spatiotemporal resolution and maintain life functions. Various organelles are present within cells to carry out these biochemical reactions efficiently, and each organelle maintains an optimum, unique pH for the various biochemical reactions (Non-patent Reference 1).
Since the pH is an important regulatory factor for cell function, changing the pH of an organelle greatly changes the function of the organelle. For example, in the endocytosis pathway that decomposes proteins taken up into the cell, the pH in the endosome acidifies as the endosome matures from 6.3 (early endosome)→5.5 (late endosome)→4.7 (lysosome), and the biochemical reactions that occur within the endosome also change accordingly from protein selection (early endosome) to protein decomposition (lysosome). Thus, since the pH within a cell is closely related to the chemical reactions that occur within the cell, measuring the intracellular pH is important for explaining the life phenomena that occur within a cell.
Fluorescence imaging has been the most widely used method for detecting intracellular pH in recent years. Fluorescence imaging uses a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe (abbreviated hereinafter as pH probe) based on an organic small-molecule fluorescent dye and a fluorescent protein. The pH probe has the characteristic of greatly changing fluorescence characteristics as the nearby pH changes. Detecting this change in fluorescence characteristics by an instrument such as a fluorescence microscope or plate reader makes it possible to measure the pH within a living cell conveniently.
pH probes include off/on type probes in which the fluorescence intensity rises greatly as the pH changes and ratio type probes in which the absorption wavelength or fluorescence wavelength changes greatly as the pH changes.
An off/on type pH probe has the advantage that it can be utilized even in relatively simple optical systems since excitation and fluorescence detection are carried out at only one wavelength each. However, it is difficult to measure the pH inside a cell quantitatively using an off/on type pH probe because increases and decreases in the probe concentration with cell contraction, leakage of the probe outside the cell, and the like are observed as increases and decreases in fluorescence intensity, that is, changes in pH.
A ratio type pH probe carries out excitation or fluorescence detection at two wavelengths, calculates the ratio of fluorescence intensity thereof, and observes the changes in the ratio value as changes in pH. Therefore, an optical system suitable for ratio measurement, such as an excitation light-switching device or multiple fluorescence detectors, is necessary to use a ratio type pH probe. On the other hand, an excellent characteristic of ratio type pH probes is that measurement errors due to factors other than changes in pH can be lessened since the ratio value does not change even if the probe concentration fluctuates. Therefore, the use of a ratio type pH probe makes it possible to measure the pH within a cell quantitatively. Ratio type pH probes consequently contribute greatly to explaining life phenomena associated with changes in pH.
There are two types of ratio type pH probe widely used today in biochemical research: the seminaphthorhodafluors (SNARF) and 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5- (and -6-)carboxyfluoresceins (BCECF) shown in FIG. 1.
The most widely used pH probe “SNARF-1” (FIG. 1 (a)) is a one wavelength excitation/two wavelength photometric type; it enables ratio imaging when excited by light of 488 nm and fluorescence detection is carried out at 580 nm and 640 nm. SNARF-1 is used mainly for pH measurement of the cytoplasm because it is mainly localized in the cytoplasm and has a pKa (=7.5) suited to the pH fluctuation zone of the cytoplasm. Giant molecules such as proteins and microorganisms can also be labeled using an active ester form of SNARF, and the course of endocytosis of the target cell can be visualized. The disadvantages of SNARF-1 are said to be that the fluorescence quantum yield is relatively low (acidic side 0.03, basic side 0.09), the probe is sensitive to temperature and environment (the fluorescence decreases 25% with a change of 25° C.→37° C., and the fluorescence also decreases upon interaction with proteins), and is susceptible to photobleaching (Non-patent Reference 2). SNARF-4F, a SNARF derivative with the pKa lowered to 6.3, is also used to visualize acidification of the cytoplasm.
The next widely used “BCECF” (FIG. 1 (b)) is a two wavelength excitation/one wavelength fluorescence type; ratio imaging becomes possible when it is excited at 440 nm which is an isosbestic point and 488 nm near the peak top, and fluorescence detection is carried out at 535 nm. BCECF is used mainly in pH measurement of the cytoplasm because it is localized in the cytoplasm and has a pKa (=7.0) suited to the pH fluctuation zone of the cytoplasm. The disadvantages of BCECF are said to be that, while the absorbance and fluorescence quantum yield are high on the basic side, the absorbance and fluorescence quantum yield are low on the acidic side, ratio imaging is difficult due to large differences in luminance, and the probe is susceptible to photobleaching in the same way as fluorescein, which is the main skeleton. BCECF derivatives having different pKa are also not marketed.
Thus, conventional ratio type pH probes were developed based on a seminaphthorhodafluor or fluorescein skeleton which have a low fluorescence quantum yield, are temperature- and environment-dependent, and susceptible to photobleaching. The problem was therefore that long-term imaging was difficult and accurate pH measurement was difficult due to environmental factors such as the surrounding temperature and the environment of the organelle. pH probe derivatives having various pKa have also scarcely been developed by organochemical modification because structural modification of the probe molecule is difficult.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problems to be Solved by the Invention
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a pH probe having a high quantum fluorescence yield and high resistance to photobleaching that is suitable for visualization of various pH environments within a cell such as weakly basic, neutral, and weakly acidic environments.
Means Used to Solve the Above-Mentioned Problems
When the present inventors conducted in-depth studies to solve the above problems, they discovered that, when they conducted various studies in the belief that the problems posed by existing pH probes cannot be solved by developing a ratio type pH probe using an Si-based rhodamine skeleton having high fluorescence quantum yield and high photobleaching resistance as had been developed by the present inventors in recent years, the pKa of the pH probe can be adjusted easily by introducing a piperazine ring into an asymmetric Si-based rhodamine skeleton and also introducing an electron-withdrawing group onto a piperazine ring amino group, and completed the present invention.

More specific examples include a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, cyclopropyl group, n-butyl group, sec-butyl group, isobutyl group, tert-butyl group, cyclopropylmethyl group, n-pentyl group, n-hexyl group, and the like as alkyl groups.

In general formula (I), R1 represents a hydrogen atom or from one to three of the same or different monovalent substituents present on the benzene ring. Here, R1 are introduced at three positions on the benzene ring other than positions substituted by R2a and R2b. When R1 represents monovalent substituents present on the benzene ring, one or two of the same or different substituents are preferably present on the benzene ring. When R1 represents one or more monovalent substituents, the substituents can be substituted at any positions on the benzene ring. Preferably, R1 represents hydrogen atoms (i.e., all R1 are hydrogen atoms) or when one substituent is present (i.e., one R1 is a monovalent substituent and the others are hydrogen atoms).
The type of monovalent substituent represented by R1 is not particularly restricted, but monovalent substituents are preferably selected from the group consisting of a C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkenyl group, C1-6 alkynyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group, sulfonyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group, halogen atom, or amino group. These monovalent substituents may also have one or more arbitrary substituents. For example, one or more halogen atoms, carboxy groups, sulfonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, alkoxy groups, and the like may be present in alkyl groups represented by R1, and alkyl groups represented by R1 may be alkyl halide groups, hydroxyalkyl groups, carboxyalkyl groups, aminoalkyl groups, or the like. One or more alkyl groups may also be present in amino groups represented by R1, and amino groups represented by R1 may be monoalkylamino groups or dialkylamino groups. In addition, carboxy-substituted alkoxy groups, alkoxycarbonyl-substituted alkoxy groups, and the like can be given as examples of when alkoxy groups represented by R1 have substituents; more specific examples include a 4-carboxybutoxy group, 4-acetoxymethyloxycarbonylbutoxy group, and the like.
In one preferred aspect, R1 is monovalent substituents such as C1-6 alkyl groups, and the substituents are present at from position 3 to position 5 on the benzene ring.
In one embodiment of the present invention, at least one R1 is a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site (also referred to as a “biopolymer label site”). A functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site means a functional group capable of reacting with a label site or target accumulation site. Examples include a carboxyl group, alkyl group having a carboxyl group, ester group, alkyl ester group, amino group, amide group, alkylamino group, isothiocyanate group, sulfonyl chloride group, haloalkyl group, haloacetamide group, azide group, alkynyl group, and the like. Especially preferred are a carboxyl group, alkyl group having a carboxyl group, amino group, and amide group.
When at least one R1 is a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site, the other R1 may be hydrogens or the abovementioned monovalent substituents (C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkenyl group, C1-6 alkynyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, hydroxyl group, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group, halogen atom, or amino group).
In one preferred aspect, at least one R1 is a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site, and the functional group is present at from position 3 to position 5 on the benzene ring.
In a preferred aspect of the present invention, at least one R1 is a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site (most preferably a carboxyl group, alkyl group having a carboxyl group, amino group, or amide group), and the other R1 are hydrogens.
In general formula (I), R2a and R2b each independently represent hydrogen or a monovalent substituent. However, R2a and R2b are not both hydrogen. The type of monovalent substituent represented by R2a and R2b is not particularly restricted. Like R1, it is selected, for example, from the group consisting of a C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkenyl group, C1-6 alkynyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, hydroxyl group, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, alkoxycarbonyl group, halogen atom, or amino group.
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the monovalent substituent in R2a and R2b is a C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, or halogen atom.
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, one of R2a and R2b is hydrogen and the other is a C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, or halogen atom.
In yet another preferred embodiment of the present invention, both R2a and R2b are C1-6 alkyl groups. Though not intending to be bound by theory, this is because the stability of the probe in solution can be improved when both R2a and R2b are C1-6 alkyl groups.
The monovalent substituent represented by R2a and R2b may also be a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site. Examples of functional groups capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site include a carboxyl group, alkyl group having a carboxyl group, ester group, alkyl ester group, amino group, amide group, alkylamino group, isothiocyanate group, sulfonyl chloride group, haloalkyl group, haloacetamide group, azide group, alkynyl group, and the like. Especially preferred are a carboxyl group, alkyl group having a carboxyl group, amino group, and amide group.
In one embodiment of the present invention, one of R2a and R2b is a monovalent substituent described above (preferably a C1-6 alkyl group, C1-6 alkoxy group, or halogen atom) , and the other is a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site. In this case, at least one R1 may be a functional group capable of introducing a label site or target accumulation site, all R1 may be hydrogens, or at least one R1 may be a monovalent substituent such as a C1-6 alkyl group and the remaining R1 may be hydrogens.
In general formula (I), R3 and R4 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, C1-6 alkyl group, or halogen atom. When R3 and R4 represent alkyl groups, one or more halogen atoms, carboxy groups, sulfonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, alkoxy groups, or the like may be present in the alkyl group. For example, the alkyl group represented by R3 or R4 may be an alkyl halide group, hydroxyalkyl group, carboxyalkyl group, or the like. R3 and R4 each independently are preferably a hydrogen atom or halogen atom. It is more preferred when both R3 and R4 are hydrogen atoms or when both R3 and R4 are fluorine atoms or chlorine atoms.
In general formula (I), R5 and R6, when present, each independently represent a C1-6 alkyl group or aryl group. It is preferred, however, that R5 and R6 each independently are C1-3 alkyl groups, and more preferred that both R5 and R6 are methyl groups. One or more halogen atoms, carboxy groups, sulfonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, alkoxy groups, or the like may be present in alkyl groups represented by R5 and R6. For example, the alkyl groups represented by R5 and R6 may be an alkyl halide group, hydroxyalkyl group, carboxyalkyl group, or the like. When R5 or R6 represents an aryl group, the aryl group may be a monocyclic aromatic group or a condensed aromatic group; and the aryl ring may include one or more ring member heteroatoms (such as a nitrogen atom, oxygen atom, or sulfur atom). A phenyl group is preferred as the aryl group. One or more substituents may be present on the aryl ring. For example, one or more halogen atoms, carboxy groups, sulfonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, amino groups, alkoxy groups, or the like may be present as substituents.
When X, which will be described later, is an oxygen atom, R5 and R6 are not present.
When X is a phosphorus atom, one of -R5 and -R6 may be ═O. In a preferred aspect of when X is a phosphorus atom, one of -R5 and -R6 is ═O and the other represents a C1-6 alkyl group or aryl group.
In general formula (I), R7 and R8 each independently represent a hydrogen atom, C1-6 alkyl group, or halogen atom, the same as explained for R3 and R4. It is preferred that R7 and R8 are both hydrogen atoms, that both are chlorine atoms, or that both are fluorine atoms.
In general formula (I), R9 and R10 each independently represent a hydrogen atom or C1-6 alkyl group.
In addition, R9 or R10, together with R3 or R7, may form a five- to seven-membered heterocyclyl or heteroaryl including the nitrogen atoms to which R9 or R10 is bonded, may also contain from one to three heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of an oxygen atom, nitrogen atom, or sulfur atom as ring members, and the heterocyclyl or heteroaryl may also be substituted by C1-6 alkyl, C2-6 alkenyl, or C2-6 alkynyl, C6-10 aralkyl group (benzyl group, phenethyl group, or the like), or C6-10 alkyl-substituted alkenyl group. Examples of the heterocyclyl or heteroaryl formed in this way include, but are not limited to, pyrrolidine, piperidine, hexamethyleneimine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiazole, and the like.
In general formula (I), Y represents a substituted or unsubstituted aryl group or heteroaryl group. In the present invention, the pKa of the piperazine ring amino group can be changed by introducing an aryl group or heteroaryl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, onto the piperazine ring amino group, thereby making it possible to adjust the pKa of the pH probe easily.
Examples of aryl groups include a phenyl group and naphthyl group; a phenyl group is preferred. Examples of heteroaryl groups include a pyridyl group, pyrazyl group, pyrimidyl group, pyridazyl group, indolyl group, benzofuranyl group, benzothienyl group, benzothiazolyl group, pyrrolyl group, furanyl group, thienyl group, imidazolyl group, thiazolyl group; a pyridyl group is preferred.
In addition, in the present invention, further adjustment as in raising or lowering the pKa is possible by introducing additional electron withdrawing groups or electron donating groups into the aryl group or heteroaryl group introduced onto the piperazine ring amino group.
As for substituents introduced into the aryl group or heteroaryl group, examples of electron withdrawing groups include a nitro group, sulfonyl group, carbonyl group, halogen atom (fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, or iodine atom), C1-6 alkoxy group, and the like. A fluorine atom and sulfonyl group are preferred. The aryl group or heteroaryl group can have two or more of the above electron withdrawing groups; these electron withdrawing groups may be the same or different.
Examples of electron donating groups include an amino group, methoxy group, and C1-6 alkyl groups. A t-butyl group, sec-butyl group, n-butyl group, iso-propyl group, n-propyl group, ethyl group, methyl group, amino group, and methoxy group are preferred. The aryl group or heteroaryl group can have two or more of the above electron donating groups; these electron donating groups may be the same or different.
In general formula (I), m is an integer of 0-6. In general formula (I), m is preferably 0 or 1 to obtain an effective electron withdrawing effect of the aryl group or heteroaryl group introduced as Y.

Compounds of embodiment 3, compounds of general formulas (Ib) and (IIb), make it possible to visualize various phenomena involving intracellular acidic vesicles in real time because they can label specific proteins and the like, and can be localized within acidic organelle cells. As a non-limiting example, when an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester as a label site or polyethylene glycol modified at the end by a carboxyl group or the like is introduced into the molecule, the fluorescent probe of the present invention can be localized in intracellular acidic vesicles by labeling by dextran, which is a sugar polymer. When a weakly basic amine is introduced into the molecule as a target accumulation site, the fluorescent probe of the present invention can be accumulated in acidic vesicles. In addition, when a Halo tag ligand is introduced as a label site, a label specific to the Halo tag becomes possible. Specifically, by expressing a protein (VAMP2-Halo tag) in which a Halo tag was fused to VAMP2, which is a synaptic vesicle marker, in nerve cells and adding a fluorescent probe of the present invention having a Halo tag ligand introduced thereto, it becomes possible for the fluorescent probe to specifically label the synaptic vesicles.

Example 5
The spectral characteristics of compound 1 of the present invention (2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR) were evaluated. The absorption spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, and excitation spectrum were measured using a Shimadzu UV-1650PC absorption spectrophotometer and a Hitachi F-4500 fluorometer. The results are shown in FIGS. 2a-e.
FIG. 2a represents the assumed chemical equilibrium equation of 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR. FIGS. 2b, 2c, and 2d respectively represent the absorption, fluorescence, and excitation spectra of 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (containing 1% DMSO) of different pH. FIG. 2e calculated the pKa=6.4 of the protonation reaction by plotting the changes in absorbance at 663 nm when the pH was varied.
Looking at the excitation spectra, 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR is understood to function as a ratio type pH probe since the 580 nm absorbance decreases and the 663 nm absorbance rises as the pH of the solvent moves from acidic to basic. Its pKa also decreased 0.9 in comparison to 2-Me MePiperaIndoSiR (compound with an N-methylpiperazine ring introduced) by benzylation of the piperazine aliphatic amino group. This is thought to be due to the electron withdrawing effect of the benzyl group.
Table 1 shows the optical characteristics of 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR measured in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer. The pKa value of 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR showed a relatively high quantum fluorescence yield on both the acidic side and basic side.

The absorption wavelength of compound 2 of the present invention lengthened greatly, approximately 80 nm, from approximately 580 nm to approximately 660 nm, as the pH of the solution moved from acidic to basic. On the other hand, the fluorescence wavelength did not change greatly even when the pH of the solution changed. Based on this characteristic, it was possible to calculate the pH of a solution in a cuvette by measuring the ratio in the cuvette.
Table 2 shows the optical characteristics of SiRpH3 measured in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer.
SiRpH3 in which the fluorine atom has been substituted has absorption maxima at approximately 580 nm and approximately 660 nm in accordance with the pH, in the same way as 2,6-diMe BnPiperaIndoSiR, and shows adequate fluorescence quantum yield as a fluorescent probe.

Since the organelles in a cell each have a unique pH, the pH of each organelle can be measured more accurately by developing and using pH probes having a pKa suited to pH measurement of each organelle by utilizing this pH probe mother nucleus.

It is known that dextran, a polysaccharide, is accumulated selectively in lysosomes by adding dextran to the extracellular fluid and incubating for several hours after it has been taken up into the cells. SiRpH5-Dex, which is SiRpH5 labeled by 10 kDa aminodextran, was prepared for conducting pH measurement of lysosomes using this probe.

10 kDa aminodextran (1.3 mg, 0.13 μmol) and 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (460 μL) were added to a reactor. A solution of SiRpH5-PEG6-SE (0.64 μg, 0.49 μmol) dissolved in 160 μL of DMSO was then added, and stirred for four hours at room temperature. The reaction solution was purified using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and freeze dried to obtain SiRpH5-Dex. A 10 mg/mL SiRpH5-Dex aqueous solution was prepared, and the average labeling rate of the probe was determined to be 2.6 nmol probe/1 nmol dextran by measurement of absorbance.
(2) pH Measurement of Lysosomes
(a) Study image (see FIG. 7a): SiRpH5-Dex was accumulated in the lysosomes, and the pH of the lysosomes was then made basic by adding ammonium chloride aqueous solution, which is a lysosomal basic reagent.
(b) FIG. 7b shows the intracellular pH calibration curve prepared when the SiRpH5-Dex-loaded cells were fixed by 10% formalin, the extracellular fluid was replaced by pH 4.5-7.4 sodium phosphate buffer, and imaging was conducted.
(c) MEF cells were incubated for two hours in medium including 200 μg/mL of SiRpH5-Dex. The medium was then replaced by probe-free medium, and the cells were incubated for three hours. When examined by confocal microscope, fluorescence derived from SiRpH5-Dex was observed from the vicinity of a fusion protein of Vamp7, which is a lysosomal marker protein, and the yellow fluorescent protein Venus (FIG. 7c). The pH calculated using the calibration curve from the ratio value of the site surrounded by the dotted line was 4.7. When the final concentration 33 mM ammonium chloride aqueous solution was added thereafter, the pH of the lysosomes was understood to become basic up to 6.2. It was understood that the pH can be measured within live cells using the present invention because these values are comparable to the reported pH of lysosomes and the pH of lysosomes after basifying reagent addition.
(B) Measurement of pH of Recycling Endosomes
Transferrin (Tfn), an iron transport protein, is known to be endocytosed via transferrin receptors (TfnR), transported into early endosomes, and then transported into recycling endosomes. SiRpH5-Tfn, which is SiRpH5 labeled by holotransferrin, an iron ion-transferring complex, was prepared to measure the pH of recycling endosomes using the probe.
(1) Preparation Method
Holotransferrin (9.04 mg, 0.113 μmol) and 1000 μL of 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.0) were added to a reactor. A solution obtained by dissolving SiRpH5-PEG6-SE (1.18 mg, 0.91 μmol) in 200 μL of DMSO and 800 μL of 0.1 M borate buffer (pH 8.0) was then added to the reactor, and stirred for one hour at room temperature. The reaction solution was purified using a PD-10 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) and freeze dried to obtain SiRpH5-Tfn. A 5 mg/mL SiRpH5-Tfn aqueous solution was prepared, and the average labeling rate of the probe was determined to be 7.3 nmol probe/1 nmol Tfn by measurement of absorbance.
(2) pH measurement of Recycling Endosomes
(a) Study image (see FIG. 8a): SiRpH5-Tfn was accumulated in recycling endosomes (RE), and the pH was measured.
(b) FIG. 8b shows the intracellular pH calibration curve when the SiRpH5-Tfn-loaded cells were fixed by 4% formaldehyde, the extracellular fluid was replaced by pH 4.0-7.4 HEPS buffer, and imaging was conducted.
(c) COS-1 cells were incubated for 50 minutes in buffer including 25 μg/mL of SiRpH5-Tfn. The buffer was then replaced by probe-free buffer, and the cells were incubated for 15 minutes. Images were taken by confocal microscope (FIG. 8c). Fluorescence derived from SiRpH5-Tfn was observed from a site that overlapped with a fusion protein of Rabll, which is a recycling endosome marker protein, and the green fluorescent protein GFP. The pH calculated using the calibration curve from the ratio value of the recycling endosomes surrounded by the dotted line was 5.8. This value was comparable to the reported value of recycling endosomes.
It appears on this basis that the pH of various intracellular organelles can be measured by varying the protein used to label the probe.
As shown in the examples, it was understood that the pKa of the pH probe can be adjusted easily by introducing an electron withdrawing substituent on the piperazine ring amino group. Further adjustment of the pKa, such as raising or lowering it, is believed to be possible, for example, by introducing electron withdrawing groups and electron donating groups on the benzene ring of the benzyl group.
The fluorophore Si rhodamine used as the mother nucleus of the pH probes in the examples is a fluorescent dye having a high fluorescence quantum yield and resistance to photobleaching. The present invention therefore can achieve highly accurate imaging of target molecules labeled by a small amount of molecule, which was difficult with conventional pH probes of low fluorescence quantum yield, and time lapse imaging requiring prolonged excitation light irradiation. In addition, since the environmental sensitivity is low, highly reliable pH measurement is expected to be possible in various organelles within cells. Furthermore, since the pKa of the pH probe can be adjusted arbitrarily, pH probes suitable for visualizing various pH regions from acidic to basic can be developed by matching the pH of the intracellular life phenomenon the biological researcher wishes to observe.
As above, the pH probe of the present invention is expected to serve as a useful tool for detailed analysis of various life phenomena.
