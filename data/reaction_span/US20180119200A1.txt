TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to coelenterazine analogues, methods for making coelenterazine analogues, and methods of using coelenterazine analogues in luciferase-based assays.
BACKGROUND
Bioluminescent assays are used extensively in the investigation of cellular physiology, especially processes associated with gene expression. In particular, luciferase reporter enzymes are quite valuable tools in this field, and, to date, there has been intense protein engineering to obtain small and environmentally insensitive luciferases that may be useful in bioluminescent assays. There exist a number of efficient luciferase reporters enabling whole-cell biosensor measurements, drug discovery through high-throughput screening, and in vivo imaging, which also permits the study of protein-protein interactions in living cells, apoptosis, and cell viability. Luciferases that use coelenterazine and coelenterazine analogues as substrates are among the most widely used systems due to their brightness and acceptance in whole cell applications.
However, these reactions are inherently limited by the inherent emission wavelength of the system.
SUMMARY
Many known coelenterazine analogues have deficiencies, which limit their effectiveness as luciferase substrates and usefulness in luciferase-based luminescence assays. For bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, the performance of the luciferase reaction may be limited by the emission wavelength of the substrate in the assay system. The activity of a substrate may also be affected by the tolerance of the enzyme's active site for the substrate's structure and properties. Accordingly, there exists a need for coelenterazine analogues with improved properties.
The disclosed compounds may include a coelenterazine analog core, a covalent chain linker, and an energy acceptor. The coelenterazine analog core may bind to a luciferase at the enzyme's binding site. The covalent chain may extend out of the enzyme's binding pocket such that the energy acceptor is located in proximity of the enzyme-bound coelenterazine analog core. The disclosed compounds thus are structurally distinctive from the conventional luciferase substrates in that the luciferase substrate core is covalently tethered to an energy acceptor. Yet, the disclosed compounds unexpectedly maintain the luciferase substrate activities that emit bioluminescence, while simultaneously allowing for BRET to occur due to the proximity between the covalently linked coelenterazine analog core and the energy acceptor.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Disclosed herein are compounds comprising coelenterazines analogues. The disclosed compounds may include a coelenterazine analog core, a covalent chain linker, and an energy acceptor. The coelenterazine analog core may bind to a luciferase at the enzyme's binding site. The covalent chain may extend out of the enzyme's binding pocket such that the energy acceptor is located in proximity of the enzyme-bound coelenterazine analog core. The energy acceptor may be capable of undergoing efficient BRET. The disclosed compounds thus are structurally distinctive from the conventional luciferase substrates in that the luciferase substrate core is covalently tethered to an energy acceptor. The disclosed compounds unexpectedly maintain the luciferase substrate activities that emit bioluminescence while simultaneously allowing for BRET to occur due to the proximity between the covalently linked coelenterazine analog core and the energy acceptor.
The disclosed compounds may be useful substrates of proteins that utilize coelenterazine to produce luminescence including, but not limited to, luciferases and photoproteins found in various marine organisms such as cnidarians (e.g., Renilla luciferase), jellyfish (e.g., aequorin from the Aequorea jellyfish) and decapods luciferases (e.g., luciferase complex of Oplophorus gracilirostris). The disclosed coelenterazine analogues may be tethered to a variety of energy acceptors by a stable linker. The acceptor can efficiently accept energy from the excited coelenterazine and emit at a longer wavelength, thus shifting the wavelength of emission produced by the coelenterazine/luciferase reaction. In comparison to coelenterazine, tethered coelenterazine analogues generate emission wavelengths that are shifted to the emission wavelength of the attached energy acceptor group. The tethered coelenterazines may be tethered to a variety of energy acceptors in order to modulate the wavelength of light emitted from the system.
Also disclosed herein are methods of making the disclosed compounds. The described methodology enables access to coelenterazines tethered to a variety of energy acceptors and can be performed under mild conditions utilizing a wide variety of readily available starting materials. The disclosed synthetic methodology unexpectedly provides a variety of new applications and advancements in bioluminescence technology based on coelenterazine analogues.

The luciferase may be a naturally occurring, recombinant, or mutant luciferase that uses a luciferase substrate. The luciferase substrate may be luciferin, a luciferin derivative or analog, a preluciferin derivative or analog, a coelenterazine, or a coelenterazine derivative or analog. The luminescent enzyme, if naturally occurring, may be obtained easily by the skilled person from an organism. If the luminescent enzyme is one that occurs naturally or is a recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme, e.g. one which retains activity in a luciferase-coelenterazine or luciferase-luciferin reaction of a naturally occurring luminescent enzyme, it can be obtained readily from a culture of bacteria, yeast, mammalian cells, insect cells, plant cells, or the like, transformed to express a nucleic acid encoding the luminescent enzyme. Further, the recombinant or mutant luminescent enzyme can be derived from an in vitro cell-free system using a nucleic acid encoding the luciferase. Suitable luminescent enzymes include luciferases derived from bioluminescent decapods, such as from the Oplophoroidea (e.g. Oplophorus-derived luciferases), beetle luciferases (e.g., Photinus pyralis, Photuris pennsylvanica, etc.), marine organisms such as cnidarians (e.g., Renilla luciferase), Aristeidae, Solenoceridae, Luciferidae, Sergestidae, Pasipheidae and Thalassocarididae decapoda families, copepod luciferases, such as Gaussia luciferase, such as Gaussia princeps luciferase, Metridia luciferases, such as Metridia longa and Metridia pacifica luciferases, Vargula luciferases, such as Vargula hilgendorfii luciferase, Pleuromamma xiphias luciferase, and photoproteins, such as Aequorin, and variants, recombinants, and mutants thereof.
A “luminescent reaction mixture” contains materials that will allow the luminescent enzyme to generate a light signal, i.e., luminescence. The mixture may also contain the enzyme, e.g., the luciferase enzyme or luciferase. The materials, and the particular concentrations and/or amounts, needed to generate a luminescent signal will vary depending on the luminescent enzyme used as well as the type of assay being performed. Often other materials will be added to the solution including: a buffer to maintain the reaction at the proper pH, an additive such as PRIONEX or Bovine serum albumin (BSA) to help maintain enzyme activity, reducing agents, detergents, etc.
As used herein, the terms “Oplophorus luciferase” and “Oplophorus-derived luciferase” are used interchangeably and refer to a luciferase secreted from the deep-sea shrimp Oplophorus gracilirostris (e.g., SEQ ID NO: 1), including wild-type, variants, and mutants thereof. For example, suitable Oplophorus luciferase variants are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 8,557,970 and 8,669,103, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Exemplary Oplophorus-derived luciferases include, for example, that of SEQ ID NO: 2 (also interchangeably referred to herein as “NanoLuc”, “Nluc,” “Nluc luciferase,” and “Nluc enzyme”).
As used herein, the term “reporter moiety” may refer to a moiety that, under appropriate conditions, directly or indirectly generates a detectable signal. Exemplary reporter moieties include, but are not limited to, fluorophores, luminescent molecules, dyes, radiolabels and substrates for enzymes such as luciferase. In some embodiments, a reporter moiety may indirectly generate a detectable signal, for example, when the reporter moiety is a substrate for an enzyme. The reaction of the enzyme with the substrate then produces a detectable signal such as fluorescence or luminescence. As used herein, the term “bioluminescent reporter moiety” may refer to a moiety that is a substrate for a luciferase. For example, the bioluminescent reporter moiety can be a luciferin, a luciferin derivative, e.g., pre-luciferin, aminoluciferin, quionolyl-luciferin, naphthyl luciferin, fluoroluciferin, chloroluciferin, precursors of luciferin derivatives, a coelenterazine or a coelenterazine derivative or analog, e.g., furimazine. The luminescent signal generated may be detected using a luminometer. As used herein, the term “fluorescent reporter moiety” may refer to a moiety that fluoresces. For example, the fluorescent reporter moiety may be a fluorophore, such as coumarin, rhodamine 110 (R110), fluorescein, DDAO (7-hydroxy-9H-(1,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one)), resorufin, cresyl violet, sily xanthene, or carbopyronine. Fluorescence may be detected using a fluorometer.
For the recitation of numeric ranges herein, each intervening number there between with the same degree of precision is explicitly contemplated. For example, for the range of 6-9, the numbers 7 and 8 are contemplated in addition to 6 and 9, and for the range 6.0-7.0, the number 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 7.0 are explicitly contemplated.

Compound names are assigned by using Struct=Name naming algorithm as part of CHEMDRAW® ULTRA v. 12.0.
The compounds may exist as stereoisomers wherein asymmetric or chiral centers are present. The stereoisomers are “R” or “S” depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The terms “R” and “S” used herein are configurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, in Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45: 13-30. The disclosure contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof, and these are specifically included within the scope of this invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and diastereomers and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of the compounds may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials, which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by methods of resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography, and optional liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary as described in Fumiss, Hannaford, Smith, and Tatchell, “Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry”, 5th edition (1989), Longman Scientific & Technical, Essex CM20 2JE, England, or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns, or (3) fractional recrystallization methods.
It should be understood that the compounds may possess tautomeric forms, as well as geometric isomers, and that these also constitute an aspect of the invention.
The present disclosure also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those recited in formula (I), but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention are hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, fluorine, and chlorine, such as, but not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively. Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. The compound may incorporate positron-emitting isotopes for medical imaging and positron-emitting tomography (PET) studies for determining the distribution of receptors. Suitable positron-emitting isotopes that can be incorporated in compounds of formula (I) are 11C, 13N, 15O, and 18F. Isotopically-labeled compounds of formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples using appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of non-isotopically-labeled reagent.
A. Properties of the Compounds of Formula (I)
The compounds of formula (I) may be substrates of luciferases to produce luminescence. “Luminescence” refers to the light output of a luciferase under appropriate conditions, e.g., in the presence of a suitable substrate such as a coelenterazine analogue. The light output may be measured as an instantaneous or near-instantaneous measure of light output (which is sometimes referred to as “T=0” luminescence or “flash”) at the start of the luminescence reaction, which may be initiated upon addition of the coelenterazine substrate. The luminescence reaction in various embodiments is carried out in a solution. In other embodiments, the luminescence reaction is carried out on a solid support. The solution may contain a lysate, for example from the cells in a prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression system. In other embodiments, expression occurs in a cell-free system, or the luciferase protein is secreted into an extracellular medium, such that, in the latter case, it is not necessary to produce a lysate. In some embodiments, the reaction is started by injecting appropriate materials, e.g., coelenterazine analogue, buffer, etc., into a reaction chamber (e.g., a well of a multiwell plate such as a 96-well plate) containing the luminescent protein. In still other embodiments, the luciferase and/or coelenterazine analogues (e.g., compounds of formula (I)) are introduced into a host and measurements of luminescence are made on the host or a portion thereof, which can include a whole organism or cells, tissues, explants, or extracts thereof. The reaction chamber may be situated in a reading device which can measure the light output, e.g., using a luminometer or photomultiplier. The light output or luminescence may also be measured over time, for example in the same reaction chamber for a period of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. The light output or luminescence may be reported as the average over time, the half-life of decay of signal, the sum of the signal over a period of time, or the peak output. Luminescence may be measured in Relative Light Units (RLUs).
Compounds of formula (I) can have an RLU of greater than or equal to 1, greater than or equal to 2, greater than or equal to 3, greater than or equal to 4, greater than or equal to 5, greater than or equal to 10, greater than or equal to 20, greater than or equal to 30, greater than or equal to 40, greater than or equal to 50, or greater than or equal to 100, relative to coelenterazine or a known coelenterazine analogue.
In a bioluminescent assay, compounds of formula (I) can have greater than or equal to 80%, greater than or equal to 85%, greater than or equal to 90%, or greater than or equal to 95% of their emitted photons shifted to the emission wavelength of the energy acceptor. For example, the energy acceptor may have an emission wavelength of 500-800 nm.
“Biocompatibility” refers to the tolerance of a cell (e.g., prokaryotic or eukaryotic) to a coelenterazine analogue (e.g., compounds of formula (I)). Biocompatibility of a coelenterazine analogue is related to the stress it causes on the host cell.
Enhanced biocompatibility of the coelenterazine analogues (e.g., compounds of formula (I)), may be determined by measuring cell viability and/or growth rate of cells. For example, enhanced biocompatibility of the coelenterazine analogues may be determined by measuring cell viability in the absence of luciferase expression of cells exposed to the coelenterazine analogues compared to native or known coelenterazines to determine how compatible and/or toxic the coelenterazine analogues are to the cells.
In particular, enhanced biocompatibility may be determined using cell viability analysis (e.g., using the CELLTITER-GLO® Luminescent Cell Viability assay), an apoptosis assay (e.g., using the CASPASE-GLO® assay technology), or another method known in the art. The effect of the compounds of formula (I) on cell viability or apoptosis may be compared to the effect of native or known coelenterazine analogues on cell viability or apoptosis.
Enhanced biocompatibility may also be determined by measuring the effect of the coelenterazine analogues (e.g., compounds of formula (I)) on cell growth or gene expression. For example, enhanced biocompatibility of the compounds of formula (I) may be determined by measuring the cell number after a period of time or by determining the expression of stress response genes in a sample of cells that are exposed to compounds of formula (I) compared to cells exposed to a native or known coelenterazine or no coelenterazine. The effect of the compounds of formula (I) on cell growth or gene expression may be compared to a native or known coelenterazine.
B. Synthesis of Compounds of Formula (I)
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by synthetic processes or by metabolic processes. Preparation of the compounds by metabolic processes includes those occurring in the human or animal body (in vivo) or processes occurring in vitro. Suitable synthesis methods may include, for example, those disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 62/295,363 to Shakhmin et al., “COELENTERAZINE ANALOGUES,” filed Feb. 15, 2016 (Attorney Docket No. 016026-9574), which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.

Scheme 1 illustrates the conversion of intermediates A and B to the compound of formula (I), wherein q is 1. Intermediates A and B can be treated with 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine and undergo Homer-Wadsworth-Emmons olefination with aldehyde v, wherein R1 is as defined in the Summary, to yield intermediate vi. Intermediate vi can be reduced to give the compound of formula (I).
Optimum reaction conditions and reaction times for each individual step can vary depending on the particular reactants employed and substituents present in the reactants used. Specific procedures are provided in the Examples section. Reactions can be worked up in the conventional manner, e.g. by eliminating the solvent from the residue and further purified according to methodologies generally known in the art such as, but not limited to, crystallization, distillation, extraction, trituration, and chromatography. Unless otherwise described, the starting materials and reagents are either commercially available or can be prepared by one skilled in the art from commercially available materials using methods described in the chemical literature. Starting materials, if not commercially available, can be prepared by procedures selected from standard organic chemical techniques, techniques that are analogous to the synthesis of known, structurally similar compounds, or techniques that are analogous to the above described schemes or the procedures described in the synthetic examples section.
Routine experimentations, including appropriate manipulation of the reaction conditions, reagents and sequence of the synthetic route, protection of any chemical functionality that cannot be compatible with the reaction conditions, and deprotection at a suitable point in the reaction sequence of the method are included in the scope of the invention. Suitable protecting groups and the methods for protecting and deprotecting different substituents using such suitable protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art; examples of which can be found in PGM Wuts and TW Greene, in Greene's book titled Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (4th ed.), John Wiley & Sons, NY (2006), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Synthesis of the compounds of the invention can be accomplished by methods analogous to those described in the synthetic schemes described hereinabove and in specific examples.
When an optically active form of a disclosed compound is required, it can be obtained by carrying out one of the procedures described herein using an optically active starting material (prepared, for example, by asymmetric induction of a suitable reaction step) or by resolution of a mixture of the stereoisomers of the compound or intermediates using a standard procedure (such as chromatographic separation, recrystallization or enzymatic resolution).
Similarly, when a pure geometric isomer of a compound is required, it can be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure geometric isomer as a starting material or by resolution of a mixture of the geometric isomers of the compound or intermediates using a standard procedure such as chromatographic separation.
Basic addition salts may be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the disclosed compounds by reaction of a carboxyl group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, or aluminum, or an organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. Quaternary amine salts can be prepared, such as those derived from methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylphenethylamine, 1-ephenamine and N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, piperazine, and the like.
It can be appreciated that the synthetic schemes and specific examples as described are illustrative and are not to be read as limiting the scope of the invention as it is defined in the appended claims. All alternatives, modifications, and equivalents of the synthetic methods and specific examples are included within the scope of the claims.
3. Methods of Use and Kits
The compounds of the disclosure may be used in any way that luciferase substrates, e.g., coelenterazine analogues, have been used. For example, they may be used in a bioluminogenic method that employs an analogue of coelenterazine to detect one or more molecules in a sample, e.g., an enzyme, a cofactor for an enzymatic reaction, an enzyme substrate, an enzyme inhibitor, an enzyme activator, or OH radicals, or one or more conditions, e.g., redox conditions. The sample may include an animal (e.g., a vertebrate), a plant, a fungus, physiological fluid (e.g., blood, plasma, urine, mucous secretions), a cell, a cell lysate, a cell supernatant, or a purified fraction of a cell (e.g., a subcellular fraction). The presence, amount, spectral distribution, emission kinetics, or specific activity of such a molecule may be detected or quantified. The molecule may be detected or quantified in solution, including multiphasic solutions (e.g., emulsions or suspensions), or on solid supports (e.g., particles, capillaries, or assay vessels).
In certain embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) may be used to modify the emission spectra of luminescence generated as a result of reaction with the luciferase enzyme. In some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) may be tethered by a stable covalent linker to an acceptor molecule which undergoes BRET, shifting the emission spectra of the reaction towards the inherent emission wavelength of the acceptor molecule. Energy acceptors include but are not limited to small molecule fluorescent dyes such as NCT, quenchers, fluorescent particles such as Quantum dots, luminescent metal complexes, and any other known energy acceptors.
In certain embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) may be used to quantify small molecules. In some embodiments, a coelenterazine (e.g., a native or known coelenterazine or a compound of formula (I)) can be used as a probe of a specific biochemical activity, e.g., apoptosis or drug metabolism. In some embodiments, the coelenterazine concentration is coupled to a specific enzyme activity by a “pro-coelenterazine” or “pro-substrate” that can be acted on by the specific enzyme of interest. In some embodiments, the pro-coelenterazine is a molecule that cannot support luminescence directly when combined with a luciferase, but can be converted into coelenterazine through catalytic processing by a specific enzyme of interest. In some embodiments, the approach can be used for enzymes such as those used in drug metabolism, e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes, monoamine oxidase, and glutathione S-transferase; and apoptosis, e.g., caspases. For example, coelenterazine (e.g., a native or known coelenterazine, or a compound of formula (I)) can be modified to contain a cleavable group, such as 6'-O-methyl. In some embodiments, when incubated with a specific cytochrome P450 enzyme, the 6'O-methyl is cleaved, and the pro-coelenterazine converted to coelenterazine, which can be detected with a luciferase. In some embodiments, the pro-coelenterazine can be combined with other components necessary to support luminescence, e.g., luminescent protein such as a luciferase, to provide a single reagent and a homogeneous assay. For example, when the reagent is added to a sample, luminescence is generated as pro-coelenterazine is converted to coelenterazine. In various embodiments, similar assays can be developed for other enzymes, small molecules, or other cellular processes that can be linked to the generation of coelenterazines from pro-coelenterazines.
In certain embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) can be used for detecting luminescence in live cells. In some embodiments, a luciferase can be expressed in cells (as a reporter or otherwise), and the cells treated with a coelenterazine (e.g., a compound of formula (I)), which will permeate cells in culture, react with the luciferase and generate luminescence. In addition to being cell permeant, the compounds of formula (I) show comparable biocompatibility to native coelenterazine in terms of cell viability. In some embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) containing chemical modifications known to increase the stability of native coelenterazine in media can be synthesized and used for more robust, live cell luciferase-based reporter assays. In still other embodiments, a sample (including cells, tissues, animals, etc.) containing a luciferase and a compound of formula (I) may be assayed using various microscopy and imaging techniques. In still other embodiments, a secretable luciferase is expressed in cells as part of a live-cell reporter system.
In certain embodiments, the compounds of formula (I) disclosed herein may be provided as part of a kit. In some embodiments, the kit may include one or more luciferases (in the form of a polypeptide, a polynucleotide, or both) and a coelenterazine, along with suitable reagents and instructions to enable a user to perform assays such as those disclosed herein. The coelenterazine may be any of the native, known, or compounds of formula (I) disclosed herein. The kit may also include one or more buffers, such as those disclosed herein.
4. Examples
Example 1. General Synthesis
General Procedure for Method I:
In a 20 mL vial, is placed methyl 2-((3-benzyl-5-phenylpyrazin-2-yl)amino)-2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate (A) (1 eq.), aldehyde (v) (1.1 eq.), and 12 mL of methanol. To that solution, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (3 eq.) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until it reaches maximum conversion (2-6 hours). The progress of the reaction is monitored by LCMS. The mixture is poured into water, extracted with ethyl acetate, and dried over MgSO4. The drying agent is filtered off, and the solvent is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane as eluent. The corresponding dehydrocoelenterazine with the general structure vi is isolated and used in the next step without further purification.
Dehydrocoelenterazine vi is dissolved in 25 mL of dichloromethane and 10 mL of methanol and cooled to 0° C. To this solution, NaBH4 (3 eq.) is added, and the reaction mixture stirred at 0° C. for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is quenched with the 50 mL of 0.1 M HCl, extracted with dichloromethane, and dried over MgSO4. The drying agent is filtered off, the solvent is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is purified on silica gel using dichloromethane/methanol as eluent. The target coelenterazine analogue is isolated and dried on high vacuum.
