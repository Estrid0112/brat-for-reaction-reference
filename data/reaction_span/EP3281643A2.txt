TECHNICAL FIELD
The present disclosure relates to a probe for detecting in vivo hydrogen sulfide, and specifically, to a probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide including a complex compound into which a radioactive isotope Cu is introduced.
BACKGROUND ART
According to results of recent studies, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is known to be involved in various physiological phenomena as a 3rd gasotransmitter and gasomediator, together with nitric oxide and carbon monoxide.
A level of hydrogen sulfide in blood plasma is known to be about 50 µM-100 µM, and results of recent studies reported that hydrogen sulfide acts as an important signaling molecule in many different physiological actions such as various inflammatory responses, cardiovascular diseases, vasodilation, glucose metabolism, neovascularization, etc., indicating that it is possible to diagnose a disease such as Down syndrome, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, liver cirrhosis, etc. simply by detecting the level of hydrogen sulfide.
Particularly, hydrogen sulfide has attracted attention because it functions as a K-ATP channel opener, and contributes to homeostasis of the cardiovascular system, and plays a role in treating cardiac muscle damage. In this regard, WO 2014027820 A1 discloses a real-time biosignal measurement apparatus for cardiac ischemia and reperfusion, including a hydrogen sulfide sensor which detects hydrogen sulfide concentrations in real time.
Further, in vivo hydrogen sulfide is produced by three enzymes of cystathionine-synthase (CBS), cystathionine-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), and hydrogen sulfide inhibits intracellular oxidative stress by inducing glutathione (GSH) which functions to protect cells by a cell immune system and an antioxidant action. Cytosolic hydrogen sulfide produced by CSE enters mitochondria via Katp channels under conditions of increased intracellular oxidative stress, and induces GSH, together with mitochondrial hydrogen sulfide produced by 3-MST and CAT enzymes, thereby protecting cells.
As such, since hydrogen sulfide induces changes of the GSH concentration to actually protect cells, it serves as a mediator preventing cell dysfunction and inhibiting apoptosis. Therefore, if detection of mitochondrial hydrogen sulfide and measurement of its concentration are possible, it will contribute to studying various life phenomena.
Accordingly, many technologies capable of detecting and quantifying hydrogen sulfide are being developed competitively, and in particular, development of a method of detecting in vivo hydrogen sulfide by non-invasive imaging has emerged as an important issue.
Although involvement of hydrogen sulfide in disease diagnosis and physiological phenomena has received attention and various types of probes are now being introduced, detection and accurate quantification of hydrogen sulfide are known to require very difficult and complex conditions such as measurement of H2S in a liquid state, selectivity for hydrogen sulfide over other anionic species, selectivity for hydrogen sulfide over reduced glutathione (GSH), etc.
In this regard, a method of detecting hydrogen sulfide by using a chromophore that utilizes chemical properties of intracellular cytosolic hydrogen sulfide and blood plasma hydrogen sulfide, a method of detecting hydrogen sulfide by passing a specific electrode through sulfide ions, and a method of detecting hydrogen sulfide by gas chromatography have been used until now. In recent years, various fluorescent probes have been developed. However, due to limitations of the fluorescent probe method, detection of hydrogen sulfide through imaging is very limited to a small animal level, and its application in practical bioimaging and studies on life phenomena is extremely restricted.
As a general fluorescent probe for detecting H2S, a 2,4,6-triaryl pyridium cation compound was disclosed (Journal of the American Chemical Society, 125, 9000, 2003), but there is a problem that this compound cannot avoid competitive reaction with GSH. Further, a method of using 2,4 dinitrobenzene sulfonyl fluorescein as a fluorescence enhancement probe was suggested (Analytica Chimica Acta, 631, 91, 2009), but there is a problem that fluorescence intensity is changed over time due to hydrolysis of sulfonic acid ester.
In addition, an aminofluorescein compound (DPA-4-AF) having 2,2-dipicolylamine containing divalent copper ions (Cu2+) was disclosed (Myung Gil Choi, et. al., Chem. Commun., (47), 7390-7392, 2009). A compound, in which a fluorescent material is attached to cyclen, cyclam, TACN, etc., is disclosed in WO2012-144654A1. This compound itself emits fluorescence, but it does not emit fluorescence by quenching of copper ions once binding with copper to form a complex compound. When hydrogen sulfide reacts with the complex compound, the copper complex is detached in a CuS form. Depending on the degree, fluorescence intensity to be restored differs. On the basis of this principle, a method of quantifying the amount of hydrogen sulfide was disclosed. However, this compound still has many problems in that images can be acquired only in vitro, and it is difficult to selectively detect hydrogen sulfide in vivo. Development of a new technology capable of replacing the known detection methods is still demanded.

As shown in Table 5, results of measuring reactivity with various anions containing sulfur showed that 64Cu-labeled complex compounds of Examples 1, 2, 16 and 20 according to the present disclosure selectively reacted with hydrogen sulfide whereas 64Cu-labeled complex compounds of Examples 3 and 21 did not selectively react with hydrogen sulfide, and they also reacted with other biothiol compounds or anions.
Further, selective reactivity of radioactive isotope copper ions, which were not labeled with chelates, with hydrogen sulfide was examined. As a result, it was found that the copper ions reacted with various biothiol compounds or anions, unlike 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure.
Experimental Example 4: Cellular uptake test
Cellular drug uptake is an important prognostic factor in the diagnosis of diseases. Therefore, to examine cellular uptake of the 64Cu-labeled complex compounds according to the present disclosure, experiments for measuring changes in the cellular uptake under various concentrations of hydrogen sulfide were performed.
A colon carcinoma cell CT-26 was seeded in each plate at a density of 5 × 106, and then 10 µCi - 300 µCi of 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Examples 1, 7 or 9 according to the present disclosure was treated thereto, followed by incubation for 10 minutes. The cells were washed with PBS, and then 0 µM, 1 µM, or 50 µM of NaHS solution was added thereto, followed by incubation for 5 minutes. Thereafter, the cells were washed with PBS, and then cells were removed from the plate by adding trypsin and EDTA, followed by centrifugation. Supernatants were discarded and radiation of remaining cells was measured by using a gamma counter.
Results are shown in the following Table 6.

As shown in Table 6, 64Cu-labeled complex compounds according to the present disclosure showed that as the NaHS concentration was increased, radiation of 64Cu-labeled complex compounds by cellular uptake slightly increased.
Experimental Example 4-2: Test of hydrogen sulfide-specific imaging
In order to examine whether the 64Cu-labeled complex compounds according to the present disclosure are able to selectively detect in vivo hydrogen sulfide, different materials were injected into the backs of rats, and then each 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to the present disclosure was injected via the tail, and then selective imaging was examined by optical imaging.
FIG. 4 shows photographs of examining selective imaging through optical imaging after injecting the backs of rats with 64Cu-labeled complex compounds according to the present disclosure. Referring to FIG. 4, at the beginning of the first experiment, matrigel alone, matrigel + 1 mg NaCl, matrigel + 0.5 mg NaHS, and matrigel + 0.05 mg NaHS were injected into four sites on the backs of rats, respectively. 1.8 mCi of the 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to Example 1 was injected via the tails of rats, immediately followed by optical imaging. As a result, of the four sites, signals were detected only in the lower two sites injected with NaHS generating hydrogen sulfide. Even after 4 hours, signals were still detected only in the lower two sites.
Next, at the beginning of the second experiment, about 0.48 mCi of 64Cu(II) ion, 64CuS, 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to Example 1, and 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to Example 16 were injected into four sites on the backs of the same rats, respectively. Immediately, optical images were taken and shown in a lower left image of FIG. 4. A photograph taken after 4 hours was shown in a lower right image of FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 4, 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to Example 1 and 64Cu-labeled complex compound according to Example 16 were very rapidly excreted from the body, unlike 64CuS. A retention time of 64Cu(II) ion was about half of 64CuS. These experiments showed that the 64Cu-labeled complex compounds according to the present disclosure bind with hydrogen sulfide to form 64CuS, which remains for a long time in the body, thereby being easily detected by imaging.
Preparation Example 1: Preparation of animal models
(1) Paw pain inflammation model
A small amount of CFA (complete Freund's adjuvant) or formalin was injected into only one paw (right) of the hind paws of Balb/c or ICR mice to establish inflammation models. 1 day after injection of the inflammation inducer, the mice were used in imaging or other in vivo experiments.
It is a known fact that inflamed sites show high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide.
(2) Myocardial infarction model
A myocardial infarction model was established by using Sprague-Dawley rats (12-week-old or older, about 250 g). 2 days later after induction of myocardial infarction by occlusion of the coronary arteries in the heart, the rats were used in imaging tests. It is a known fact that myocardial infarction sites show high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide.
(3) Arthritis model
An arthritis inducer, bovine type II collagen was intradermally injected into the tails of DBA/1J mice twice, and 5 weeks later (about 13-week-old), the mice were used in imaging tests. Arthritis degree of the paw was quantified by scoring.
(4) Brain inflammation model
An inflammation inducer, lipopolysaccharide was directly injected into one part of the brain of Sprague-Dawley rat to induce inflammation in one part of the brain. 24 hours after induction of inflammation, the rats were used in imaging tests.
(5) Tumor model
To prepare a CT26 tumor model, the number of cells was counted using a haemacytometer, and 5 × 106 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank of BALB/c mouse. About 10 days later, when formation of about 1 cm of tumor was observed, the mice were used in subsequent experiments.
To prepare an EMT6 tumor model, the number of cells was counted using a haemacytometer, and 2 × 105 cells were subcutaneously injected into the right flank and left shoulder region of BALB/c female mouse. About 2∼ 3 weeks later, when formation of about 1 cm of tumor was observed, the mice were used in subsequent experiments.
(6) Sepsis model
After the lower abdominal region of ICR mice was opened, a small puncture in the appendix was made by using a syringe needle to prepare an acute sepsis model.
(7) Brain tumor model
The surface of the rat's head was incised and the capillaries and meninges on the outer surface of the skull were removed. Subsequently, a hole was made at the defined coordinates by stereotactic surgery, and 20,000 C6 cells which are known as glioma cells of the rat brain were injected by using a syringe pump. After cell injection, the syringe was left for about 5 minutes to allow absorption of the cells, and then slowly removed. The hole was filled with bone cement, and then sutured to prepare a brain tumor model.
(8) Pancreatitis model
Caerulein (50 µg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected into Balb/c mouse seven times at hourly intervals to prepare a pancreatitis model.
Experimental Example 5: Optical imaging and nuclear medicine imaging studies
Nuclear medicine imaging was measured by using an Inveon PET/CT system of Siemens Healthcare, and optical imaging was measured by using IVIS spectrum CT equipment. Cherenkov radiation emitted from 64Cu was measured by using a highly sensitive CCD (charge-coupled device) camera.
Imaging was measured for 1 minute to 5 minutes, and a radiation dose was about 50 µCi to 2000 µCi, and photographs were variously taken as needed, such as immediately after first injection, at 1 hour, 4 hours, and 24 hours later.
(1) Paw inflammation model
As shown in FIG. 5A, result of treating 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure showed that higher uptake in the inflamed right paw than in the opposite paw was observed in PET imaging. As shown in FIG. 5B, optical imaging showed increased uptake of 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure in the CFA-induced inflamed site. As shown in FIG. 5C, it was confirmed that 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure showed a high reaction rate with hydrogen sulfide such that the inflamed site can be detected immediately after injection (1.5-10 minutes).
As shown in FIG. 5D, the same results were also observed in the paw inflammation ICR and Balb/c mouse models, and 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure showed a retention time of 24 hours or longer in the animal models, suggesting that therapeutic effects may be predicted in a non-invasive manner without continuous injection of the drug.
As shown in FIGS. 6A to 6C, higher uptake of 64Cu-labeled TACN of Example 20 was observed in the inflamed paw than in the opposite paw when imaging was performed after 1 hour, and the same result was also observed in PET imaging. The inflamed site was also detected in imaging immediately after injection of 64Cu-labeled TACN of Example 20.
In addition, selective uptake of 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Examples 2, 3, 14 or 21 according to the present disclosure in inflamed sites was also observed in optical imaging and nuclear medicine imaging, as shown in FIGS. 7A to 7D and FIGS. 8A to 8E.
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 9A to 9B and FIGS. 10A to 10B, higher uptakes of 64Cu-labeled compounds 1g and 1i of Examples 7 and 9 in the inflamed paw than in the opposite paw were observed in the optical and nuclear medicine imaging which were performed 2 hours later.
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 11A to 11D, 64Cu-labeled cyclam of Example 16 showed no obvious difference in the inflamed and normal paws, and its injection showed low uptake, compared to injection of the same quantity of 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1.
(2) Arthritis model
When 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure was injected into the arthritis model, selective uptake in the joint region was observed, as shown in FIGS. 13A and 13B.
(3) Brain inflammation model
Inflammation was induced by injecting LPS into the half of the rat's brain, and 1 day later, 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Example 17 according to the present disclosure was injected, followed PET imaging. As shown in FIG. 14, higher uptake was observed in the inflamed site than in the opposite site.
Experimental Example 6: Imaging study in myocardial infarction model
It is known that myocardial infarction sites show high concentrations of hydrogen sulfide. Thus, after induction of myocardial infarction by coronary artery occlusion in rats, 50 µCi-900 µCi of the 64Cu-labeled complex compound was injected via the tails of the rats, and uptake in the myocardial infarction site was examined over time by PET imaging.
2 days after injection of the 64Cu-labeled complex compound, [18F]FDG was injected, and PET imaging was performed to examine whether myocardial infarction was properly induced.
36 hours after establishment of the myocardial infarction model, 730 µCi of the radioisotope-labeled complex compound of the present disclosure was injected and nuclear medicine imaging was performed. 2 days later, 1.06 µCi of FDG was injected into the same rat, and then FDG-PET images were obtained. Results are shown in FIGS. 15 to 17 (in the nuclear medicine imaging, the upper image represents a transverse image, and the lower image represents a coronal image).
As shown in FIG. 15, in the image taken at 24 hours after injection of 64Cu-labeled cyclen of Example 1 according to the present disclosure, high uptake was detected in the myocardial infarction site such that the myocardial infarction site was clearly observed. In contrast, when FDG was injected, FDG uptake did not occur in the myocardial infarction site, and therefore, the cardiac muscles was observed not as donut-shaped rings but as partially broken rings.
As shown in FIG. 16, when 64Cu-labeled TACN compound of Example 20 was injected, the myocardial infarction site was clearly observed.
As shown in FIG. 17, when 64Cu-labeled cyclam of Example 16 was injected, no specific uptake was observed in the heart, as in the above paw inflammation and arthritis models.
Experimental Example 7: Imaging study in brain tumor model
PET images were obtained at 72 hours after injecting the 64Cu-labeled 1q compound of Example 17 into the prepared brain tumor rat model. High uptake was observed in the brain tumor, and this imaging study suggests that brain tumor may be diagnosed by using the probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide.
Experimental Example 8: Imaging study in various tumor models
PET images were obtained after injecting the 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Example 1 into the prepared rat model having EMT6 tumor and rat model having CT26 tumor. Results are shown in FIGS. 19A and 19B. Referring to FIGS. 19A and 19B, higher uptake was observed in the tumor region (red circle) than in the background, suggesting that the probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide may be used in the diagnosis of various tumors. In particular, since EMT6 tumor is commonly used as a hypoxic tumor model, the probe may be suggested as a probe applicable to detection of hypoxia in tumors.
Experimental Example 9: Imaging study in pancreatitis model
Optical images were obtained after injecting each of the 64Cu-labeled complex compounds of Example 1 and Example 20 into the prepared rat models having pancreatitis, and PET images were obtained after excision of tissues thereof. Results are shown in FIG. 20. Referring to FIG. 20, high uptakes of the 64Cu-labeled complex compounds of Example 1 and Example 20 were observed in the pancreas (red oval) of the pancreatitis models, suggesting that the probe of the present disclosure may be used to diagnose pancreatitis.
Experimental Example 10: Imaging study in sepsis model
PET images were obtained after injecting the 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Example 20 into the prepared rat model having sepsis. Result is shown in FIG. 21. Referring to FIG. 21, uptake was increased throughout the body of the sepsis model. In particular, increased uptake was observed in the lung, suggesting that the probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide may be used in the diagnosis of sepsis.
Experimental Example 11: Imaging study of hydrogen sulfide in normal rat
PET images were obtained after injecting the 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Example 1 into a normal rat, and PET images were obtained again after excision of the tongue thereof. Results are shown in FIG. 22. In PET image before excision of the tongue (A), high uptake was observed in the tongue. However, after excision (B), the uptake was decreased in the same site. Further, high uptake was observed in the tongue removed by excision. (C) is a photograph taken before imaging the tongue after excision. These results suggest that the probe for detecting hydrogen sulfide may be used in the detection of hydrogen sulfide under a normal condition as well as under a disease condition.
Experimental Example 12: Calibration study of hydrogen sulfide
64Cu-labeled TACN of Example 20 according to the present disclosures was reacted with various concentrations of NaHS which is a source of hydrogen sulfide, and decomplexation was measured to obtain a calibration curve, as shown in FIG. 23. There was a very excellent correlation therebetween, suggesting that concentrations of hydrogen sulfide may be accurately determined by measuring decomplexation.
Experimental Example 13: Comparison with common method of measuring hydrogen sulfide concentrations
In order to demonstrate that the complex compound for detecting hydrogen sulfide according to the present disclosure specifically detects a model having a specific disease showing a higher concentration of hydrogen sulfide than a normal rat, data obtained by using the 64Cu-labeled complex compound of Example 20 and a common methylene blue method were compared.
The obtained data were shown in the following Table 7 andFIG. 24.
