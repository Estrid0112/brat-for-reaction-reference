Each of plastic pots was filled with soil and rice (cultivar: NIHONBARE) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 20 days. Then, the present compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 formulated in accordance with the method mentioned in Formulation Example 6 was adjusted with water so as to have the concentration of 200 ppm, and then the dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the rice so that it sufficiently adhered to the surface of the leaves of the rice. After spraying, the plant was air-dried and subjected to a spraying treatment and the rice seedling (cultivar: NIHONBARE) infected by the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea) was left to stand for 6 days at 24° C. in the daytime and 20° C. at night under high humidity condition, while being in contact with each other, and then the area of lesion spots was investigated. As a result, the area of lesion spots on the plant treated with the present compound was 30% or less of that on an untreated plant.
Test Example 17
Each of plastic pots was filled with soil and kidney bean (cultivar: NAGAUZURA SAITO) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 8 days. Then, the present compound 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 formulated in accordance with the method mentioned in Formulation Example 6 was adjusted with water so as to have the concentration of 200 ppm, and then the dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the kidney bean so that it sufficiently adhered to the surface of the leaves of the kidney bean. After spraying, the plant was air-dried and a PDA medium containing hyphae of the kidney bean stem rot fungus (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) was placed on the leaves of the kidney bean. After the inoculation, all kidney beans were left to stand under high humidity condition only at night. Four days after the inoculation, the area of lesion spots was investigated. As a result, the area of lesion spots on the plant treated with the present compound was 30% or less of that on an untreated plant.
Test Example 18
Each of plastic pots was filled with soil and wheat (cultivar: APOGEE) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 10 days. Then, the present compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 formulated in accordance with the method mentioned in Formulation Example 6 was adjusted with water so as to have the concentration of 200 ppm, and then the dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the wheat so that it sufficiently adhered to the surface of the leaves of the wheat. After spraying, the plant was air-dried. After 4 days, an aqueous suspension containing spores of wheat leaf blotch fungus (Septoria tritici) was sprayed to inoculate the spores. After completion of the inoculation, the plant was left to stand at 18° C. under high humidity condition for 3 days and left to stand under illumination for 14 to 18 days, and then the area of lesion spots was investigated. As a result, the area of lesion spots on the plant treated with the present compound was 30% or less of that on an untreated plant.
Test Example 19
Each of plastic pots was filled with soil and cucumber (cultivar: SAGAMI HANJIRO) was sowed and grown in a greenhouse for 12 days. Then, the present compound 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 formulated in accordance with the method mentioned in Formulation Example 6 was adjusted with water so as to have the concentration of 200 ppm, and then the dilution was sprayed over stems and leaves of the cucumber so that it sufficiently adhered to the surface of the leaves of the cucumber. After spraying, the plant was air-dried and then inoculated by sprinkling with spores of cucumber powdery mildew fungus (Sphaerotheca fuliginea, a QoI-resistant strain in which, among the genes encoding cytochrome b, the amino acid residue at position 143 of cytochrome b is mutated from glycine to alanine). After the inoculation, the plant was cultivated in a greenhouse at 24° C. in the daytime and 20° C. at night for 8 days, and then the area of lesion spots was investigated. As a result, the area of lesion spots on the plant treated with the present compound was 30% or less of that on an untreated plant.
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY
