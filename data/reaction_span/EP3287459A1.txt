Background Art
Tumor is a kind of disease marked by cell malignant proliferation, having a complicated pathogenesis which often involves in heredity or epigenetic changes. The occurrence and development of tumor depend on a variety of receptors or signal transduction pathways, making the antineoplastic drugs which act on certain target point have to face following problems as: 1) The tumor cells cannot be fully killed; 2) it is easy to have drug resistance. Currently, although multi-drug combination has solved the above problems, it is likely to cause interactions between drugs, generating unpredictable adverse reactions; moreover, the usage of each drug in the combination is different from that for separate use. Compared with the drug combination, the multi-target drug can avoid interactions between drugs and have obviously better treatment effect than that of single-target drug.
In recent years, as the studies on malignant tumor are deepened constantly, more and more tumor signal pathways are found. Among which, the antineoplastic protocols with the signal transduction pathway mediated by PI3K as the target point gradually become a study hotspot. The important role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway played in the occurrence and development of tumors has been proven in many studies and its function in lung cancer and liver cancer also has been reported.
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are closely related to tumor; through deacetylation of histone N-lysine residues, gene transcription regulating and chromatin remodeling can be realized. In addition, HDACs can also catalyze non-histone deacetylation, such as p21, microtubulin, HSP90 (heat shock protein 90), etc. Inhibiting HDACs may induce cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis of tumor cells.
PI3K protein kinase and HDAC are the most important target points for tumor cell survival; HDAC inhibitor may have inhibition effect on tumor cell messenger multiple target points through epigenetic regulatory mechanism. The significant anti-cancer effect of PI3K inhibitor and HDAC inhibitor has been verified clinically. Multiple HDAC inhibitors as vorinostat (SAHA), panobinostat (LBH589) and chidamide have come into the market upon approval.
Based on the structure characteristics of PI3K kinase inhibitor GDC-0941, Qian CG et al. used the method of pharmacophore splicing, i.e., splicing the pharmacophores of PI3K kinase inhibitor and HDACIs inhibitor into a molecule. Through a great deal of in vivo/in vitro screening, the most preferred compound CUDC-907 is found. It can potently inhibit PI3Ks enzyme of Type I and HDAC enzyme of Type I & II, and its inhibition values to activities of HDACl, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC8, HDAC6, HDAC10, HDAC11, PI3Kα, PI3Kβ, PI3Kγ and PI3Kδ are respectively 1.7, 5.0, 1.8, 191, 27, 2.8, 5.4, 19, 54, 39 and 311nM[1]. The subsequent pharmacology experiment shows that, multiple signal pathways are decreased by inhibiting HDAC through CUDC-907 and the tumor cell growth is thus inhibited. For its favorable subsequent performance, Curis declared on April 6, 2015 that FDA has granted CUDC-907 the qualification of orphan drug for treating diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Such progress also promotes and encourages the research and development of DAC-kinase multi-target inhibitors.
However, currently there are no related reports to difunctional kinase inhibitors having the biochemical structure of purinyl-N-hydroxyl pyrimidine formamide derivative.

The tumor cells of human multiple myeloma model as U266 and RPMI-8226 and the tumor cells of human B-cell lymphoma model as ramos and SUDHL-4 are purchased from ATCC and cultivated to the status of logarithmic growth as per the cultural method recommended by ATCC; the tumor cell of human multiple myeloma model as MM1S is provided by Hematology Department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University and cultivated to the status of logarithmic growth as per the cultural method recommended by the Department; the tumor cell of human B-cell lymphoma model as OCI-LY1 is purchased from DSMZ and cultivated to the status of logarithmic growth as per the cultural method recommended by DSMZ; the tumor cell of human B-cell lymphoma model as HBL-1 is purchased from RIKEN and cultivated to the status of logarithmic growth as per the cultural method recommended by RIKEN. The cells in logarithmic phase are spread on a 96 well plate as per 7,500-10,000/well; then adding the compound into the test wells at certain concentration for incubation for 96h and determining cell proliferation activities with method cck-8, and analyzing the result data with the software GraphPad Prism.
Calculating the value of IC50 as per the formula: Y=background data + (top data - background data) /(1+10^ ((LogIC50-X)* rate of curve)). Where, Y refers to the inhibition ratio (%) and X refers to the compound concentration.
Several preferred compounds of the Invention and the inhibitory effect thereof to the proliferation activity of multiple hematological tumor cells cultured in vitro are listed in the following Table 6. The values of IC50 of the results are expressed through the grading as: 1µM >A>100nM, 100nM>B>10nM, 10nM>C>1nM and 1nM>D>0.1nM. The positive compound LBH589 is purchased from Selleck Company.

It is shown from Table 6 that the 5 preferred compounds have inhibitory effect to proliferation activities of a few tumor cell lines of human multiple myeloma and human B-cell lymphoma; the value of IC50 is of level nM. Wherein, the four compounds as CLJ-1, CLJ-8, CLJ-29 and CLJ-44 have equal or superior activity to positive drug LBH589.
Embodiment 79 Investigation on inhibition capability of compound CLJ-44 to activities of multiple animal subcutaneous solid tumor models
The solid tumor model comprises human colon cancer hct116, human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231; the hematological tumor model comprises human multiple myeloma MM1S and human B-cell lymphoma Raji.1) Laboratory animal: positive drug LBH589 purchased from Selleck Company; SPF female nude mice BALB/c (Balb/C nu/nu), 4-6 weeks old, 18-22g and NOD/SCID female mice, 6-8weeks old, purchased from Beijing Huafukang Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Production Permit No.: SCXK (J) 2014-0012. Test condition: SPF animal room; Laboratory Animal Usage License No.: SYXK (J) 2015-00232) Cell source and culture
Human colon cancer hct116, human breast cancer MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 and human B-cell lymphoma Raji are purchased from ATCC, the breed of which is conserved in the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University; human multiple myeloma cell strain MM1S is provided by Hematology Department of West China Hospital of Sichuan University and subcultured in the State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, Sichuan University. Cell MM1S is cultured in RPMI1640 medium (HyClone) which contains 10% fetal calf serum (Hohhot Caoyuan Lvye Bioengineering Material Co., Ltd.) and 100 U/mL penicillin and streptomycin (Beyotime).3) Inoculation, grouping and treatment: collecting cells in logarithmic phase under aseptic conditions and counting; diluting the single cell suspension with the medium containing neither fetal calf serum nor antibiotics to 1×107-8 cell/mL for standby. Mixing the cell suspension; injecting 100 µL of cell suspension (5×106-2×107 cells) subcutaneously with a 1mL injector on the right side of the back of animals. Weeding out the animals with oversized and undersized tumor when the tumor grows to an average volume of about 120mm3 and grouping the qualified animals for treatment and drug administration. Refer to Table 7 for each grouping model and drug administration frequency. Measuring the weight of each model per 2 days and measuring the length and width of the tumor with a vernier caliper; killing the tested animals through cervical dislocation and peeling off their tumors for weight measuring and photographing. Then calculating the tumor inhibition ratio (%) and evaluating the inhibition intensity to tumor with such tumor inhibition ratio. The treatment effect of the compound CLJ-44 to each model is listed in the following Table 7.

It is shown from Table 7 that, the compound CLJ-44 has favorable inhibitory effect to the tumor activities of various human subcutaneous transplantation tumor models (including colon cancer, breast cancer, multiple myeloma and B-cell lymphoma). It has good interdependence between dosage and tumor inhibitory rate in each model and the inhibition capability to tumor activity is obviously better than the reference drugs SAHA and LBH589.
