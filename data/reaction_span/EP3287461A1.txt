FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention belongs to the field of medicine, and relates to an imidazo isoindole derivative, a preparation method therefor and a medical use thereof. The present invention discloses that the derivative is used as an IDO inhibitor for treating a disease with the pathological feature of IDO-mediated tryptophan metabolic pathway. The disease comprises cancer, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune disease, depression, anxiety, cataract, psychological disorder and AIDS.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Tumor is one of the major diseases that seriously endanger human life, while more than half of tumors are occurring in developing countries. The overall incidence of malignant tumor in China is on the rise, increasing by the average annual rate of 3% to 5%. By 2020, it is predicted that 4 million people will suffer from cancer, and 3 million people will be died of cancer. The main reasons are due to aging, urbanization, industrialization and lifestyle changes. In the hospital drug market of China, the scale of anti-tumor drug sales has been steadily growth in recent years. It was reached 66.42 billion yuan in 2012, with an increment of 13.07% year on year; By 2017, the scale of anti-tumor drug market is predicted to reach 105.57 billion yuan, with an increment of 7.57% year on year.
Due to the unlimited growth, infiltration and metastasis of malignant tumors, tumor cells can't be completely cut off or killed by three conventional treatment methods (surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) used in clinical, and tumor metastasis or recurrence occur frequently. Tumor biotherapy is a new therapy for tumor prevention and treatment using modem biotechnology and related products thereof. Because of its safety, efficacy and rare adverse reactions, tumor biotherapy becomes the fourth mode of tumor therapy after surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which achieves an antitumor effect by mobilizing the host's natural defense mechanism (such as inhibition of IDO-mediated tumor immune escape mechanism) or administering naturally occurring highly targeted substances.
Indoleamine-pyrrole-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a heme-containing monomeric protein, consisting of 403 amino acid residues, including of two folded Î±-helix domains, wherein the large domain contains a catalytic pocket, hydrophobic interaction and the like can be carried out between the substrate and IDO in the catalytic pocket. IDO is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to formyl kynurenine, widely distributed in tissues of humans and other mammals (rabbits, mice) with the exception of liver. It is the only rate-limiting enzyme which can catalyze the metabolism of tryptophan enzyme, in addition to the liver. It is known that tryptophan is not only an essential amino-acid for maintaining the activation and proliferation of cells, but also an important indispensable component to form protein. IDO is closely related to many kinds of cytokines such as interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) etc., which can activate IDO under certain conditions. There is an adjustment point that is very sensitive to the level of tryptophan in the cell cycle of T-cell. On the one hand, IDO can lead to the depletion of local tryptophan, resulting in the stagnation of T-cell in the middle of G1 phase, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of T-cell; On the other hand, canine urea, which is the main product of tryptophan metabolism catalyzed by IDO, induces the apoptosis of T-cell by the changes of intracellular oxidants and antioxidants induced by the mediation of oxygen free radicals, which is an inherent immunosuppressive mechanism in the body. A large number of studies have shown that IDO is highly expressed in leukemic cells, the proliferation of local T-cell and T-cell-mediated immune response are inhibited, the transduction of T-cell activation signal is blocked, thereby mediating the tumor cell to escape from the attack of immune system. It has been found that IDO is expressed constitutively in most human tumors. Thus, IDO is a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.
Patent applications disclosing selective inhibitors of IDO include WO2012142237, WO2004094409, WO2006122150, WO2007075598, WO2010005958 and WO2014066834, etc.
IDO inhibitors have a good application prospects as a drug in the pharmaceutical industry, but at present, a good IDO inhibitor which can be used as a marketed drug has not been found. In order to achieve better tumor treatment, and to better meet the market needs, the inventors hope to develop a new generation of selective IDO inhibitors with highly efficiency and low toxicity. The present invention provides a novel compound as a selective IDO inhibitor, and it is found that the compound having such a structure shows excellent effect and function, particularly excellents pharmacokinetic activity.

A 96 well reaction plate (AXYGEN, PCR-96-FLT-C) (hereinafter referred to as the reaction plate) was added with the enzyme solution at 24 ÂµL/well. The blank well was added with 24 ÂµL of KPB [Preparation of KPB buffer (50mM): 6.805 g of KH2PO4 was weighed by a analytical balance, and placed into a 1000 ml of beaker, deionized water was added with a measuring cylinder to 900 ml, the pH was adjusted to 6.5 by 1M KOH, then the mixture was introduced into a 1 L measuring cylinder, and water was added to 1 L.

The reaction mixture was mixed uniformly for 30 seconds on a shaker, and incubated for 1 hour at 37Â°C in a constant temperature incubator. In the reaction plate, 30% (W/V) trichloroacetic acid was added at 10 ÂµL/well, then the mixture was incubated for 15 minutes at 65Â°C in a incubator. The reaction plate was centrifuged in a centrifuge for 5 mins at 4700RPM at room temperature. 40 ÂµL of the supernatant was transferred from the reaction plate to the corresponding 96 wells test plate (Coming, #3599) by a multi-channel pipette. 2% (W/V) 4-(dimethylamino)benzaldehyde/glacial acetic acid solution was added at 40 ÂµL/well, then the mixture was mixed uniformly for 1 minute on a shaker at the maximum speed.
