Technical Field
The present invention relates to the field of organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry. Particularly, the present invention relates to deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives; the present invention also relates to the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives, a manufacturing method thereof, and an application thereof in the manufacturing of a drug for treating and preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
Background
Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine drug, can inhibit the platelet activity with high efficiency and is currently an anti-platelet drug that is widely used for acute coronary syndrome and treating patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Its structural formula is present as follow:
Clopidogrel is a pro-drug without activity, and needs to be converted to the active metabolite by the liver cytochrome P450 (CYP450), the metabolic process is present as follow:
This metabolite binds the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor P2Y12 on the surface of the platelet membrane to play the role of blocking the binding between ADP and the platelet receptor and secondarily activating the ADPmediated glycoprotein GPIIbPIIIa complex, and thereby to inhibit the platelet aggregation (Arterio-sclerThromb Vase Biol, 1999, 19 (8): 2002-2011). Clopidogrel can substantially reduce the incidence of the formation of the subacute stent thrombosis, reducing the occurrence of death and cardiovascular events such as recurrent heart infarction. However, recent studies found that about 11%âˆ¼44% (AmHeart J, 2009, 157 (2): 375-382.) patients showed low response or even no response to clopidogrel, and this phenomenon has been also called the "clopidogrel resistance".
China patent application 201310428052.4 discloses the thienopiperidine derivative with the following structure, which is a pro-drug of the 2-oxy-clopidogrel (metabolite of the clopidogrel), to improve the "clopidogrel resistance".
However, this series of compounds still have the disadvantages such as low inhibition rate of the platelet aggregation and high hydrolysis rate. In order to solve the disadvantages described above, develop new anti-platelet aggregation drugs with quick clinical onset, good therapeutic effect, and ability to avoid clopidogrel resistance, and find compounds which are advantageous to be formulated into a formulation so as to improve the bioavailability, reduce the side effects, and facilitate the dissolution, absorption, and administration, the present invention has developed a series of new deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives, a manufacturing method and an application thereof based on the China patent application 201310428052.4. China patent application 201310428052.4 is entirely incorporated into the present invention as the prior art of the present invention.

Deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives of the present invention are preferably the following compounds:
The present invention also comprises the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives, wherein the salt can be a salt formed by deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives with sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, formic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, oxalic acid or succinic acid.
The present invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof described by the present invention. The pharmaceutical composition can also comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier as desired. The pharmaceutically acceptable inert carrier can be in the solid state or liquid state. Powders, tablets, dispersible powders, capsules, suppositories and ointment-like solid or semi-solid pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared, and in that case a solid carrier is usually used. The solid carrier which may be used is preferably one or more substances selected from diluents, flavouring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, and swelling agents etc., or may be an encapsulating material. In the powdered formulation, the carrier contains 5%-70% of the micronized active ingredient. Specific examples of appropriate solid carriers include magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sucrose, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatine, tragacanth gum, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, low boiling wax, and cocoa butter, etc. Due to easy administration, tablets, powders, and capsules represent the oral solid formulations which are most advantageous for absorption.
The liquid formulation includes solution, suspension and emulsion. For example, the injectable formulation for parenteral administration can use water or mixed solution of water and propylene glycol, and its physiological conditions such as isotonic degrees and pH suitable for the living body are adjusted. The liquid formulation can also be formulated into the an aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. An oral aqueous solution can be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in the water, followed by addition of appropriate colorants, flavouring agents, stabilizers and thickening agents. The micronized active ingredient can be dispersed in a viscous material, such as natural or synthetic rubber, methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and other known suspending agents, to prepare an oral aqueous suspension.
For the easy administration and dose evenness, it is particularly advantageous for the above pharmaceutical formulation to be formulated into unit dosage form. The unit dosage form of a formulation refers to the physically detachable unit suitable as a single dose, with each unit containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient calculated to give the desired therapeutic effect. This unit dosage form can be a packaged form, for example, tablets, capsules, powders packaged in a tubule or vial, or ointments, gels or creams packaged in a tube or bottle.
Although the quantity of the active ingredient in the unit dosage form may vary, it is usually adjusted to be in the range of 1-1000 mg depending on the efficacy of the selected active ingredient.
Those skilled in the art can determine a preferred dose suitable for a certain instance according to conventional method. In general, the initial treatment dose is lower than the optimal dose of the active ingredient, and then the dose of administration is increased gradually, until the optimal therapeutic effect is accomplished. For convenience, the total daily dose can be divided into several portions and administered for several times.
The application of deuterated thienopiperidine derivatives of the present invention or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is present in manufacturing drugs for treating and preventing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases such as heart failure, stroke, and unstable angina, especially the application in manufacturing the anti-platelet aggregation drugs.

Embodiment 12: Drug efficacy study of the compounds of the present invention
Experimental method:
Addition of small dose of ADP (concentration less than 0.9 Âµmol/L) into the platelet suspension could lead to rapid platelet aggregation, followed by quick disaggregation; if moderate dose of ADP (about 1.0 Âµmol/L) was added, then the second irreversible aggregation phase appeared not long after the end of the first aggregation phase and the disaggregation. The maximum aggregation rate of the irreversible aggregation phase was used to evaluate the effect of the test samples on the function of blood coagulation. The present experiment used the semi-automatic Platelet Aggregation Analyzer Model NJ4 from Precil to observe the inhibitive effect of the test samples provided by the Tasly Group on the platelet aggregation.
Experimental materials:

It could be seen from the comparison study of the pharmacokinetics of the key metabolite 2-oxo-clopidogrel that the exposure amount of the key metabolic intermediate of the deuterated compound TSD-6 developed was evidently higher than that of the non-deuterated compound TSC-6 and similar compound I-1 of the same kind for both oral and intravenous injection administrations. The pharmacokinetic data exhibited a better unique metabolic characteristic of TSD-6, which will be advantageous to improve the drug effect and overcome the disadvantages of the prior compounds.
