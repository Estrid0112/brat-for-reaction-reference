Technical Field
The present invention relates to a heterocyclic compound having a monoacylglycerol lipase (sometimes to be abbreviated as "MAGL" in the present specification) inhibitory action, a pharmaceutical composition containing same, and the like.
(Background of the Invention)
Arachidonic acid (sometimes to be abbreviated as "AA" in the present specification), and eicosanoids, which are products in vivo, have been reported to cause inflammation in the central nervous system and peripheral [non-patent document 1: Science, vol. 294, pages 1871-1875, 2001]. An inhibitor that suppresses arachidonic acid production pathway, and eicosanoid production pathway is promising as a therapeutic drug for inflammatory diseases, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as cyclooxygenase inhibitor and the like have been used as therapeutic drugs for inflammatory pain. However, when a cyclooxygenase inhibitor is used for a long time, digestive tract disorders are sometimes developed as side effects, thus posing a problem. In addition, cardiovascular side effects such as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and the like also pose problems in recent years.
Neuroinflammation accompanied by activation of glial cells has been suggested to be a pathological change characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease etc.) [non-patent document 2: Molecular Neurobiology (Mol. Neurobiol), vol. 41, pages 115-128, 2010]. It has been reported that anti-inflammatory drugs suppress activation of glial cells and suppress neurodegenerative progression in an animal model of tau overexpression (human variant tau transgenic mouse etc.) which is a pathological characteristic of Alzheimer's disease [non-patent document 3: Neuron, vol. 53, pages 337-351, 2007]. In addition, the effectiveness of suppression of neuroinflammation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and the like has been suggested [non-patent document 4: Nature Reviews Immunology (Nat. Rev. Immunol.), vol. 6, pages 193-201, 2010], and a therapeutic drug that suppresses neuroinflammation is promising as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug for neurodegenerative diseases.
Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes monoacylglycerol into fatty acid and glycerol. In the central nervous system, the substrate of MAGL is 2-arachidonoylglycerol (also referred to as 2-AG in the present specification) which is degraded to arachidonic acid and glycerol [non-patent document 5: Chemistry and Physics of Lipids (Chem phys Lipids) vol. 121, pages 149-158, 2002]. In recent years, suppression of production of arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, suppression of activation of glial cell, suppression of production of inflammatory cytokine, and a decreasing action on the accumulation of Aβ plaque which is a pathological finding of Alzheimer's disease have been reported in a crossbred animal of MAGL deficient mouse and amyloid β (to be also referred to as Aβ in the present specification) overexpressing animal model (APP/PS1 double transgenic mouse etc.) [non-patent document 6: Cell Report (Cell Rep.), vol. 1, pages 617-623, 2012], and inhibitors etc. that suppress the action of MAGL are promising as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug for Alzheimer's disease.
In addition, as receptors of 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, cannabinoid receptor 1 (to be referred to as CB1 in the present specification), and cannabinoid receptor 2 (to be referred to as CB2 in the present specification) have been identified [non-patent document 7: Biochemical Pharmacology (Biochem. Pharmcol.) vol. 50, 83-90, 2005]. CB1 is mainly expressed in the brain region [non-patent document 8: Molecular Pharmacology (Mol. Pharmacol.), vol. 34, pages 605-613, 1988], and CB2 is expressed in immune cells, and microglial cell in the brain region [non-patent document 9: Neuroscience Letters (Neurosci. Lett.), vol. 396, pages 113-116, 2006]. In recent years, it has been reported that CB1 receptor agonist improves cognitive function [non-patent document 10: Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (J. Alzheimers. Dis.), vol. 30, pages 439-459, 2012], and 2-AG, which is the substrate of MAGL, shows a protective action against neuronal cell death due to Aβ [non-patent document 11: Neuroscience, vol. 178, pages 159-168, 2011]. Therefore, MAGL inhibitor that suppresses degradation of 2-AG is promising as a therapeutic or prophylactic drug that suppresses neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death, Aβ accumulation and the like observed in Alzheimer's disease and having effects on not only symptomatic relief but also disease-modification.
Parkinson's disease, which is one of the neurodegenerative diseases, is a disease associated with movement disorders caused by the degeneration of midbrain substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, in which activation of glial cell has been reported [non-patent document 12: Annals of Neurology (Ann. Neurol.) vol. 56, pages 168-175, 2005]. While 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) is known to induce midbrain dopaminergic neuronal cell death in substantia nigra, it has been reported to show a protective action against neuronal cell death in MAGL deficient mice [non-patent document 13: Science, vol. 334, pages 809-813, 2011]. Therefore, inhibitors etc. that suppress the action of MAGL are promising as new therapeutic drugs for Parkinson's disease.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (to be referred to as ALS in the present specification) is a disease associated with degeneration of motor neuron, and an effective treatment method does not exist at present. Activation of glial cell in ALS has been reported [non-patent document 14: Neurobiology of Disease (Neurobiol. Dis.) vol. 15, pages 601-609, 2004]. It has also been reported that activation of CB2 suppresses progression of the disease in mutant superoxide dismutase overexpressing mice as an animal model of ALS [non-patent document 15: European Journal of Pharmacology (Eur. J. Pharmacol.), vol. 542, pages 100-105, 2006]. In addition, it has been reported that MAGL deficient mice are less susceptible to neuoroinflammation due to decreased arachidonic acids, which is an in vivo product of MAGL [non-patent document 13: Science, vol. 334, pages 809-813, 2011]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for ALS.
Huntington's disease which is one of the neurodegenerative diseases is a disease wherein a neurological function is lost by neuronal cell death and neuroinflammation due to polyglutamine aggregation. It has been reported that activation of CB2 suppresses neuroinflammation and shows a neuroprotective action in R6/2 mice as an animal model of Huntington's disease [non-patent document 16: Brain, vol. 132, pages 3152-3164, 2009]. In addition, it has been reported that MAGL deficient mice are less susceptible to neuoroinflammation due to decreased arachidonic acids, which is a product of MAGL [non-patent document 13: Science, vol. 334, pages 809-813, 2011]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for Huntington's disease.
2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to suppress progression of the disease state in an autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, i.e., an animal model of multiple sclerosis which is one of the central demyelination diseases [non-patent document 17: Brain Research (Brain Res.), vol. 1390, pages 126-141, 2011]. In addition, it has been reported that MAGL deficient mice are less susceptible to neuoroinflammation due to decreased arachidonic acids, which is a product of MAGL [non-patent document 13: Science, vol. 334, pages 809-813, 2011]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for multiple sclerosis.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a condition exerting an extremely harmful influence on the health of individuals, and an effective treatment method does not exist at present. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to have a protective action against neuronal cell death in a closed head injury animal model [non-patent document 18: Nature, vol. 413, pages 527-531, 2001]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic or prophylactic drug for traumatic brain injury.
Glaucoma most often causes loss of eyesight, and is considered a serious social problem. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to activate aqueous outflow in an intraocular perfusion model [non-patent document 19: Experimental Eye Research (Exp. Eye Res.), vol. 87, pages 106-114, 2008]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic or prophylactic drug for glaucoma.
Anxiety disorder is a mental disease that occurs highly frequently, and greatly influences the quality of life. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to show an anti-anxiety action in an elevated plus maze test, which is an effective test system of anxiety disorder [non-patent document 20: Behavioural Brain Research (Behav. Brain Res.), vol. 252, pages 10-17, 2013]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for anxiety disorders.
2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to show an antinociceptive effect in a formalin test [non-patent document 21: British Journal of Pharmacology, vol. 150, pages 693-701, 2007]. In addition, 2-AG has been reported to show effects in a mechanical hyperalgesia test which is a carcinomatous pain model [non-patent document 22: Pharmacological Research (Pharmacol. Res.), vol. 64, pages 60-67, 2011]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain.
Epilepsy greatly influences daily life. It is known that neuroinflammation has been induced in the hippocampus of temporal lobe epilepsy patients, and neuroinflammation accompanied by activation of glial cells is involved in convulsive seizure [non-patent document 23: Nature Medicine (Nature Med.), vol. 16, pages 413-419, 2010]. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has a suppressive action on pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsive attack, which is an acute convulsion model [non-patent document 24: Neurochemical Research (Neurochem. Res.), vol. 36, pages 1520-1525, 2011]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for epilepsy.
Depression is a disease that occurs highly frequently in the modern society, and greatly influences the quality of life. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to show an anti-depression action on chronical stress model which is an effective test system of depression [non-patent document 25: Neuropsychopharmacology, vol. 39, pages 1763-1776, 2014]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for depression.
Migraine is a disease that occurs highly frequently in the modern society, and greatly influences the quality of life. One of the factors that develop migraine is neuroinflammation. Activation of CB2 has been reported to have an analgesic action in nitroglycerin-administered rat, which is an effective test system of migraine [non-patent document 26: Journal of Headache and Pain, vol. 15, No. 14, 2014]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for migraine.
Cerebral edema is a disease developed in association with various encephalopathies. One of the causes of cerebral edema is collapse of blood-brain barrier. Arachidonic acid and eicosanoids are known to collapse blood-brain barrier [non-patent document 27: Brain Research, vol. 1298, pages 13-23, 2009]. An inhibitor that suppresses the action of MAGL decreases production of arachidonic acid by MAGL. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for cerebral edema.
Cerebral ischemia is one factor causing the onset of cerebral infarction. 2-AG, which is a substrate of MAGL, has been reported to have a brain protective action in a test system for cerebral ischemia [non-patent document 28: Brain Research, vol. 1474, pages 91-99, 2012]. Therefore, an MAGL inhibitor is promising as a new therapeutic drug for cerebral ischemia.

Experimental Example 1: Cloning of human MGLL encoding MAGL protein and construction of expression plasmid
Human MGLL cDNA was obtained by PCR using human ORF Clone (DNAForm; Clone ID: 100004585) as a template. For PCR, two kinds of primers:5'-CCACCATCATCACGGATCCATGCCAGAGGAAAGTTCCCCCA-3' [SEQ ID NO: 1]and 5'-TGGTGCTCGAGTGCGGCCGCTCAGGGTGGGGACGCAGTTC-3' [SEQ ID NO: 2]and PrimeSTAR MAX DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.) were used, and (1) reaction at 98°C for 1 min, (2) 25 cycles of reaction at 98°C for 10 sec and 68°C for 10 sec as one cycle, and (3) reaction at 72°C for 1 min were performed. The obtained PCR product was digested with Bam HI and Not I (Takara Bio Inc.), inserted into the Bam HI/Not I site of pET21HH(V) (pET21a (Novagen) inserted with His x6 and TEV Protease recognition sequence) by using Ligation High (Toyobo Co., Ltd.), and introduced into ECOS™ JM109 (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.), whereby expression plasmid pET21HH(V)/His-hMGLLv2 for Escherichia coli was constructed.
Experimental Example 2: Preparation of recombinant polyhistidine tagged human MAGL protein
Recombinant His-hMAGL protein was prepared by transforming ECOS™ Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) (Nippon Gene Co., Ltd.) with the pET21HH(V)/His-hMGLLv2 plasmid prepared above. Escherichia coli obtained by transformation was inoculated to 10 mL of LB medium (1% peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium chloride, 0.01% ampicillin), and cultured at 30°C for 16 hr. The obtained culture medium (5 mL) was transplanted into a 2L Sakaguchi flask containing 1L of main fermentation medium (1.05% M9 MEDIUM BROTH (AMRESCO LLC), 0.5% yeast extract, 1.5% sorbitol, 1.5% casamino acid, 0.024% magnesium sulfate, 0.01% antifoaming agent PE-L (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), 0.01% ampicillin), and shaking culture at 37°C and 150 rpm was started. When the turbidity of the culture medium reached about 500 Klett unit, the culture temperature was lowered to 16°C, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the mixture was further cultured for 19 hr. After the completion of culture, the culture medium was centrifuged (4°C, 6,000 rpm, 10 min) to give His-hMAGL-expressed Escherichia coli. Then, the His-hMAGL-expressed Escherichia coli was suspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 100 ml) containing 1% Triton X-100, 20 mM imidazole, 3 mM DTT, 5 U/mL Benzonase (Merck) and 150 mM NaCl, and the suspension was sufficiently cooled, and subjected to sonication at AMPLITUDE=60%, 15 sec/ON, 30 sec/OFF for 3 min using 3/4" solid type crushed horn of BRANSON Digital Sonifier 450 (Central Scientific Commerce, Inc.). Furthermore, the homogenate was centrifuged (4°C, 6,000 rpm, 20 min) and the supernatant was obtained. As the purification apparatus, AKTA explorer 10s (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation) was used at 4°C. To the obtained supernatant was added 5M NaCl to the final salt concentration of 0.3 M, and the mixture was flown through and adsorbed to 5 mL of Ni-NTA Superflow Cartridges (QIAGEN) equilibrated in advance with buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.05% TritonX-100, 1 mM DTT, 300 mM NaCl). The column was sufficiently washed with buffer A containing 20 mM imidazole and His-hMAGL was eluted with buffer A containing imidazole at a final concentration of 250 mM. The eluate was further subjected to gel filtration using HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg (GE Healthcare Japan Corporation) equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 containing 10% glycerol, 0.05% TritonX-100, 1 mM DTT and 150 mM NaCl. The eluted fraction was concentrated by Amicon Ultra-15 10K (Merck Millipore) to give purified His-hMAGL protein. The protein concentration was measured by BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using BSA as the standard.
Experimental Example 3: Measurement of MAGL inhibitory activity
The His-hMAGL obtained above was diluted with enzyme reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.025 (w/v)% Triton X-100, 0.01% Bovine serum albumin) to a concentration of 7.5 ng/mL. To each well of a 384 well assay plate (Greiner 781280) was added a solution (5 µL) of a test compound dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which was diluted with the above-mentioned enzyme reaction buffer, then His-hMAGL solution (5 µL) diluted to a concentration of 7.5 ng/mL was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. Thereafter, to each well was added 5 µL of 150 µM 2-arachidonylglycerol (Tocris Bioscience), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then, 10 µL of 2% formic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was added to stop the reaction. Furthermore, acetonitrile (50 µL) containing 3 µM arachidonic acid-d8 (Cayman Chemical Company) was added and the mixture was stirred.
The amount of arachidonic acid in the obtained enzyme reaction mixture was calculated by measuring by RapidFire-mass spectrometry and correcting by the amount of arachidonic acid-d8. High Throughput online solid phase extraction was performed using RapidFire 300™ system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Samples were loaded on SPE C4 cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) and desalted with 0.2 (v/v)% acetic acid (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) in ultrapure water/acetonitrile (70/30, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min, eluted at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min with 0.2 (v/v)% acetic acid dissolved in acetonitrile/ultrapure water (90/10, v/v), and injected into the mass spectrometry part. The injection needle was washed with ultrapure water (500 millisecond) and acetonitrile (500 millisecond) to minimize carry-over. The suction time (injection loop 5 µL), load/cleansing time, elution time and re-equilibration time were adjusted to 300, 3000, 4250 and 1000 milliseconds, respectively, and the total cycle time was adjusted to about 10.0 seconds. The RapidFire300 system was controlled by RapidFire UI software version 3.6 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).
The mass spectrometry of the resultant product was performed using API4000™ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX) equipped with an electrospray ion sauce (TurboIon Spray™) in a negative selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The conditions of SRM are shown below. The parameters of the instrument were optimized as follows: capillary temperature 600°C, ion spray voltage -4.5 kV, collision gas 8, curtain gas 15 psi, ion source gas 1 60 psi, ion source gas 2 60 psi. The mass spectrometer was controlled by Analyst™ software version 1.5.1 (AB SCIEX). The peak area integration was analyzed using RapidFire integrator software version 3.6 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.).
MAGL inhibitory rate (%) was calculated according to the following calculation formula. 1−arachidonic acid production amount of test compound addition group−arachidonic acid production amount of enzyme-free group÷arachidonic acid production amount of test compound-free group−arachidonic acid production amount of enzyme-free group×100
The results are shown in the following Table 5.

Experimental Example 4: Measurement of intracerebral 2-AG and arachidonic acid concentrations
As the mouse, 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (CLEA Japan, Inc.) were used (6 mice/group). Administration solutions were prepared by suspending the test compounds (compound 1 (compound of Example 102), compound 2 (compound of Example 188) and compound 3 (compound of Example 322)) in 0.5% methylcellulose solution (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). The dose of the test compound was adjusted to be 10 mg/kg/10 mL. The test compounds were administered by gavage at 10 mg/kg. The cerebrum was isolated after the administration of the test compound (isolation time after the administration of the test compound is shown in Table 6), and the cerebrum hemisphere was extracted. The obtained cerebrum hemisphere was frozen on dry ice, and the frozen tissue weight was measured.
The cerebral tissue weight was measured, and the cerebral tissue was homogenized with 9-fold (v/w) of isopropanol (IPA) relative to the cerebral tissue weight. The prepared cerebral homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant (5 µL) was mixed with internal standard solution (95 µL) ([5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-D8]-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (AA-d8, 0.5 nmol/mL IPA) and [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-D8]-(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-2-glycerol ester (2-AG-d8, 0.5 nmol/mL IPA)) to give a sample solution. The sample solution (5 µL) was injected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometer to perform quantitative analysis.
For liquid chromatography, Shimadzu LC20A system (Shimadzu Corporation) was used. The separation was performed by gradient elution method with mobile phase A (0.01% acetic acid-1 mM ammonia-2 µM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate/water) and mobile phase B (0.01% acetic acid-0.2 mM ammonia/ethanol-isopropanol (3:2, v/v)) using XBridge C18 (2.5 µm, 2.1×50 mm, Waters) at column temperature of 60°C, at flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The gradient conditions are as follows: 0-1 min, 1% B; 1-1.2 min, 1-55% B; 1.2-2.7 min, 55-75% B; 2.7-3.5 min, 75-99% B; 3.5-6 min, 99% B; 6-8 min, 1% B.
For mass spectrometer, QTRAP5500 (AB SCIEX) was used. The eluate from the liquid chromatography was directly ionized by turbospray ionization method, where (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (AA) and AA-d8 were measured by negative ionization mode, and (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoyl-2-glycerol ester (2-AG) and 2-AG-d8 were measured by positive ionization mode. Detection conditions of the mass spectrometer are shown in Table 7.
A solution for calibration curve was prepared to the final concentration of 0.05, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, 5 nmol/mL of IPA. These solutions were mixed with 95 µL of internal standard solution, and the mixture (5 µL) was injected to liquid chromatography mass spectrometer to perform analysis. The calibration curve was drawn by regression line with a weighting of 1/x, and the quantitativity was confirmed by accuracy of 100±15% and R2>0.995.
The changes in 2-AG and arachidonic acid concentrations were calculated by the following formula. the concentration of test compound administration group/the concentration of control group
The results are shown inFig. 1 andFig. 2.
