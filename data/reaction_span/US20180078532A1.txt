TECHNICAL FIELD
This disclosure features pharmaceutical formulations (e.g., immediate release (IR) pharmaceutical formulations; e.g., solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets) that are useful for the oral administration of oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a human or animal subject as well as methods of making and using the formulations. A tablet composition and process was developed that produces an immediate release tablet that disintegrates quickly, thus allowing for absorption in the duodenum and jejunum regions of the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the adverse effects of nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhea.
BACKGROUND
The proteasome has been validated as a therapeutic target, as demonstrated by the FDA approval of bortezomib, a boronic acid proteasome inhibitor, for the treatment of various cancer indications, including multiple myeloma; and more recently, carfilzomib, a tetra-peptide epoxy ketone-containing proteasome inhibitor, for the treatment of refractory multiple myeloma.
Oprozomib (chemical structure shown below) is an orally bioavailable (epoxy ketone-containing) tri-peptide irreversible proteasome inhibitor, which has demonstrated preclinical anti-tumor activity and a broad therapeutic window in preclinical models and is currently being studied in Phase I clinical trials.

SUMMARY
This disclosure features pharmaceutical formulations (e.g., immediate release pharmaceutical formulations; e.g., solid dosage forms, e.g., tablets) that are useful for the oral administration of oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a human or animal subject as well as methods of making and using the formulations.
[I] Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea (“NVD”) is a gastrointestinal side effect that has been observed with oral administration of oprozomib, e.g., when oprozomib is formulated as a solution, a suspension, and in capsule and immediate release tablet forms. In-vivo animal studies have suggested that the NVD effect of oprozomib was the result of local proteasome inhibition, and that this local proteasome inhibition was not site (stomach or small intestine) specific. Rather, the NVD effect of oprozomib appeared to depend on the local concentration of oprozomib in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g., the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon). Once oprozomib enters the lower GI tract, it is not absorbed well thus allowing oprozomib to cause GI tolerability issues. This implied that the occurrence of high local oprozomib concentrations in the stomach, duodenum and/or jejunum regions of the GI tract would likely trigger some degree of NVD in patients and potentially impact dose escalation. The present novel and inventive formulations, unknown and after much experimentation, aim to reduce or eliminate the NVD effect of oprozomib. As such, the novel and inventive formulations described herein can provide a reduced incidence or severity of one or more GI side effects (e.g., NVD).
Numerous other embodiments of the formulations of Tables I and Ia are set forth herein.

The immediate release pharmaceutical formulations of oprozomib described herein can provide one or more of the following advantages.
The immediate release pharmaceutical formulations of oprozomib described herein can provide therapeutically effective plasma exposure of oprozomib resulting in potent proteasome inhibition of target tissues e.g., effective to treat one or more of the disorders described herein (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disease, graft or transplant-related condition, neurodegenerative disease, fibrotic-associated condition, ischemic-related conditions, infection (viral, parasitic or prokaryotic) and diseases associated with bone loss). In some embodiments, the formulations described herein can deliver oprozomib with time to peak plasma concentrations of from about 15 to 180 minutes (e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 120 minutes; e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 45 minutes; e.g., about 30 minutes; e.g., about 45 minutes, e.g., about 60 minutes) as determined in dogs. As such, the formulations described herein can efficiently release oprozomib, e.g., to the stomach and proximal part of the small intestine, and do so over an immediate period of time and, in some instances, with improved bioavailability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, thereby increasing the likelihood that oprozomib will be absorbed by the duodenum and jejunum prior to excretion and/or degradation of oprozomib. In a preferred embodiment, the formulation increases the absorption of oprozomib in the duodenum and jejunum, leaving less of the drug to be present in the ileum and colon, which can cause tolerability issues. The present formulation can increase the GI tolerability of oprozomib, which can increase the likelihood of patient compliance with the dosage regimen. As such, the formulations described herein can provide a reduced incidence or severity of one or more GI side effects (e.g., NVD).
The immediate release pharmaceutical formulations of oprozomib described herein can be prepared in a form that is suitable for oral administration, which is among the preferred routes for administration of pharmaceuticals since this route is generally convenient and acceptable to patients. In certain embodiments, the formulations described herein can be orally administered as a solid dosage form (e.g., tablet, e.g., a matrix tablet; e.g., matrix pellets; e.g., particulates filled into capsule; e.g., self-emulsified drug delivery systems (SEDDS)).

[B] Oprozomib
[1] Oprozomib can be prepared, e.g., according to the synthetic route and procedures delineated in Example 1. As used herein, “oprozomib” without a modifier such as “in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is intended to refer to the free-base form of oprozomib.[2] In some embodiments, the formulations include oprozomib.
In some embodiments, the formulations include oprozomib in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to the relatively non-toxic, inorganic and organic acid addition salts of the inhibitor(s). These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the inhibitor(s), or by separately reacting a purified inhibitor(s) in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid, and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, sulfate, bisulfate, phosphate, nitrate, acetate, valerate, oleate, palmitate, stearate, laurate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, tosylate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate, laurylsulphonate salts, and amino acid salts, and the like.

[C]
[1] In some embodiments, the formulations further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include any and all fillers, binders, surfactants (wetting agents), disintegrants, desiccants, sugars, antioxidants, solubilizing or suspending agents, chelating agents, preservatives, colorants, buffering agents and/or lubricating agents, or combinations thereof, as suited to the particular dosage form desired and according to the judgment of the formulator. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various pharmaceutically acceptable excipients used in preparing pharmaceutically acceptable formulations and known techniques for the preparation thereof. In general, the weight percent of the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients (e.g., one or more fillers) varies with the weight percent and/or strength or purity of the oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and, in some instances, the amount of oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the amount(s) of one or more other formulation components, e.g., a polymer component, e.g., HPMC.[2] In some embodiments, the formulations include one or more fillers. As used herein, the term “filler” refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable substance that forms the bulk of a tablet when the amount of the oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (and, in some instances, the amount of oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and the amount(s) of one or more other formulation components, e.g., a polymer component, e.g., HPMC) cannot provide this bulk (see The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Third Edition. Leon Lachman, Herbert Lieberman, and Joseph Kanig, editors. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia. 1986, page 325).
Non-limiting examples of fillers include microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, dibasic calcium phosphate (“DCP”), sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and sorbitol. Preferred fillers include microcrystalline cellulose and lactose monohydrate.
In some embodiments, the formulations can include two or more fillers. For example, the fillers can include microcrystalline cellulose (e.g., Avicel PH101 or Avicel PH102) and lactose monohydrate (e.g., Lactose 312 or Lactose 316).
In some embodiments, the formulations can include from about 5.00 weight percent to about 95.00 weight percent (e.g., from about 20.00 weight percent to about 80.00 weight percent, from about 30.00 weight percent to about 65.00 weight percent, from about 40.00 weight percent to about 65.00 weight percent, from about 60.00 weight percent to about 65.00 weight percent) of the one or more fillers. For example, the formulations can include about 30.84 weight percent of the one or more fillers or about 30.83 weight percent of the one or more fillers or about 61.67 weight percent of the one or more fillers.
In some embodiments, the weight percent ratio of the one or more fillers to the oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be from about 0.5 to about 3.0. For example, the weight percent ratio of the one or more fillers to the oprozomib, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be about 0.9 to about 1.85.
[3] In some embodiments, the formulations include one or more disintegrants. As used herein, the term “disintegrant” refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable agent that is added to a pharmaceutical preparation to make it disintegrate (and thus release the active ingredient) on contact with water. Disintegrants are agents added to tablet (and some encapsulated) formulations to promote the breakup of the tablet (and capsule “slugs’) into smaller fragments in an aqueous environment thereby increasing the available surface area and promoting a more rapid release of the drug substance.
Non-limiting examples of disintegrants include starch (e.g., corn starch or potato starch), Pregelatinized Starch (Starch 1500), Microcrystalline Cellulose, Modified (crosslinked) Starches (e.g.; Sodium Carboxymethyl Starch), Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, Modified (crosslinked) Cellulose
(i.e. Ac-Di-Sol (Accelerates Dissolution), croscarmellose sodium, Nymcel), crosslinked alginic acid (such as Alginic acid NF and Satiaigin®), natural super disintegrants (such as soy polysaccharides or Emcosoy®), and calcium silicate. An exemplary disintegrant is croscarmellose sodium.
In some embodiments, the formulations include from about 0.50 weight percent to about 5.00 weight percent (e.g., from about 3.0 weight percent to about 4.50 weight percent, from about 3.50 weight percent to about 4.25 weight percent, e.g., about 4.00 weight percent) of the one or more disintegrants.
[4] In some embodiments, the formulations include one or more lubricants. As used herein, the term “lubricant” refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable substance that reduces the friction associated with tablet ejection between the walls of the tablet and the walls of a cavity used to form the tablet (see The Theory and Practice of Industrial Pharmacy, Third Edition. Leon Lachman, Herbert Lieberman, and Joseph Kanig, editors. Lea & Febiger, Philadelphia. 1986, page 328).
Suitable lubricants include magnesium stearate; metal stearates, glyceryl behenate, sodium stearyl fumarate, hydrogenated vegetable oils, or fatty acids. An exemplary lubricant is magnesium stearate.
In some embodiments, the formulations can include from about 0.10 weight percent to about 2.00 weight percent (e.g., from 0.50 weight percent to about 1.20 weight percent, e.g., about 1.0 weight percent) of a lubricant.
In some embodiments, the formulations include materials, which are both lubricated (can function as a lubricant) and can function as a filler (e.g., siliconized microcrystalline cellulose (MCC)). These materials can be present in amounts as described above and/or in section [V][C][2].
In some embodiments, viscosity control agents (e.g., suspending agents), which may be polymeric or colloidal (e.g., modified cellulose polymers such as methylcellulose, hydoxyethylcellulose, hydrophobically modified hydroxyethylcellulose, and cross-linked acrylate polymers such as Carbomer, hydrophobically modified polyethers) can be included in the composition, in the core or wall.
In some embodiments, desiccants, such as silicas, either hydrophobic or hydrophilic, can be included at a concentration from 0.01 to 20%, more preferable from 0.5 to 5%, and most preferably from 1 to 2% by the weight of the capsule composition. Examples of hydrophobic silicas include silanols, surfaces of which are treated with halogen silanes, alkoxysilanes, silazanes, and siloxanes, such as SIPERNAT D17, AEROSIL, R972 and R974 available from Degussa, Exemplary hydrophilic silicas are AEROSIL 200, SIPERNAT 22S, SIPERNAT 50S (available from Degussa), and SYLOID 244 (available from W.R. Grace).
In some embodiments, the formulations include one or more desiccants (Table 1a; e.g., silicon dioxide). Preferably, the desiccant is silicon dioxide, more preferably porous silicon dioxide, more preferably silicon dioxide having a surface area of about 500 to about 1000 m2/g, most preferably having a surface area of about 700 m2/g. In one aspect of the invention, the silicon dioxide has an average pore volume of about 0.2 to about 1 cc/g, most preferably about 0.4 cc/g. SYLOID® 63FP, a porous silicon dioxide commercially available from W.R. Grace, Columbia, Md., was used in the formulation in Table 1a. Various grades of silicon dioxide, such as Cab-O-Sil M-5P®, commercially available from Cabot Corporation, Boston, Mass., were investigated but did not provide satisfactory dissolution profiles after storage at 40° C./75% RH under open conditions for 1 month.
In some embodiments, such as when the formulation is comprised of a tablet or capsule form, the formulation can further include one or more coatings (e.g., Opadry II® White (85F18422) or another color).

[B] In some embodiments, the formulations provide a reduced incidence or severity of one or more side effects (e.g., NVD).[C] In some embodiments, the formulations provide a therapeutically effective plasma exposure of oprozomib resulting in near complete proteasome inhibition of target tissues e.g., effective to treat one or more of the disorders described herein (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disease, graft or transplant-related condition, neurodegenerative disease, fibrotic-associated condition, ischemic-related conditions, infection (viral, parasitic or prokaryotic) and diseases associated with bone loss). In some embodiments, the formulations described herein can deliver oprozomib with time to peak plasma concentrations of from about 30 to about 180 minutes (e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 60 minutes; e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 45 minutes; e.g., from about 45 minutes to about 60 minutes; e.g., about 30 minutes; e.g., about 45 minutes; e.g., about 60 minutes) (SeeFIG. 9) as determined in dogs; as such, the formulations described herein can efficiently release oprozomib, e.g., to the stomach and proximal part of the small intestine, and do so over an immediate period of time and, in some instances, with improved bioavailability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters, thereby increasing the likelihood that oprozomib will be absorbed by the duodenum and jejunum prior to excretion and/or degradation of oprozomib. In a preferred embodiment, the formulation increases the absorption of oprozomib in the duodenum and jejunum, leaving less of the drug to be present in the ileum and colon, which can cause tolerability issues. The present formulation can increase the GI tolerability of oprozomib, which can increase the likelihood of patient compliance with the dosage regimen, which can increase the likelihood of patient compliance with the dosage regimen.
In certain embodiments, a single dose of the formulation to a dog produces peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of oprozomib of 66.4 ng/mL (having a standard deviation of 73.3) for a formulation comprising about 60 mg of oprozomib.
In certain embodiments, the administration of the formulation (about 60 mg of oprozomib) to a dog produces an area under the concentration time curve to the last time point (AUC) of oprozomib of 28.6 ng*hr/mL, having a standard deviation of 18.6).
[D] The present formulations may be packaged in bottles, bottles with caps, bottles with desiccants, blister packs or other well accepted packaging in the industry.
In some embodiments, the 25 mg and 50 mg formulations are stable upon actual or simulated storage in open conditions at 25° C./60% relative humidity for at least 1 month.
Stability studies were carried out using one of the following procedures:
(A) Tablets were packaged in 75 cc white HDPE bottles with closures and stored at 30° C.±2° C./65% relative humidity (RH)±5% RH and 40° C.±2° C./75% RH±5% RH. Tablets were tested for appearance, hardness, assay and impurities and dissolution at pre-determined time points.(B) Tablets were packaged in 75 cc white HDPE bottles with closures and desiccant and stored at 25° C.±2° C./60% relative humidity (RH)±5% RH and 40° C.±2° C./75% RH±5% RH. Tablets were tested for appearance, hardness, assay and impurities and dissolution at pre-determined time points. In preferred embodiments, when the formulation is stored in a 75 cc white HDPE bottle with desiccant at 25° C./60% relative humidity for at least 1 month, the formulation shows less than about 1.0% degradation of oprozomib. In more preferred embodiments, the amount of degradation of oprozomib is less than 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, and in some instances, less than 0.1%.(C) In particular, impurities PR-059176 (PR-176) and PR-487 were detected and measured.

[VIII] Uses of Formulations
Orderly protein degradation is crucial to the maintenance of normal cell functions, and the proteasome is integral to the protein degradation process. The proteasome controls the levels of proteins that are important for cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in normal and malignant cells; for example, cyclins, caspases, BCL2 and NF-kB (Kumatori et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87:7071-7075; Almond et al., Leukemia (2002) 16: 433-443). Thus, it is not surprising that inhibiting proteasome activity can translate into therapies to treat various disease states, such as malignant, non-malignant and autoimmune diseases, depending on the cells involved.
Both in vitro and in vivo models have shown that malignant cells, in general, are susceptible to proteasome inhibition. In fact, proteasome inhibition has already been validated as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. This could be due, in part, to the highly proliferative malignant cell's dependency on the proteasome system to rapidly remove proteins (Rolfe et al., J. Mol. Med. (1997) 75:5-17; Adams, Nature (2004) 4: 349-360). Therefore, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method of treating a cancer, comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound disclosed herein. As used herein, the term “cancer” includes, but is not limited to, blood borne and solid tumors. Cancer refers to disease of blood, bone, organs, skin tissue and the vascular system, including, but not limited to, cancers of the bladder, blood, bone, brain, breast, cervix, chest, colon, endometrium, esophagus, eye, head, kidney, liver, lung, lymph nodes, mouth, neck, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, rectum, renal, skin, stomach, testis, throat, and uterus. Specific cancers include, but are not limited to, leukemia (acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia), mature B cell neoplasms (small lymphocytic lymphoma, B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (such as Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or indolent lymphoma), splenic marginal zone lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, plasmacytoma, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases, heavy chain diseases, extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma (MALT lymphoma), nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma (NMZL), a gastrointestinal tumor (e.g., a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)), follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma/leukemia, diffuse B cell lymphoma, mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma, intravascular large B cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia), mature T cell and natural killer (NK) cell neoplasms (T cell prolymphocytic leukemia, T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia, aggressive NK cell leukemia, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, enteropathy-type T cell lymphoma, hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma, blastic NK cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides (Sezary syndrome), primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, lymphomatoid papulosis, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, unspecified peripheral T cell lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma), Hodgkin's lymphoma (nodular sclerosis, mixed celluarity, lymphocyte-rich, lymphocyte depleted or not depleted, nodular lymphocyte-predominant), myeloma (multiple myeloma, indolent myeloma, smoldering myeloma), chronic myeloproliferative disease, myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease, myelodysplastic syndromes, immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorders, histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms, mastocytosis, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, fibrosarcoma, malignant giant cell tumor, myeloma bone disease, osteosarcoma, breast cancer (hormone dependent, hormone independent), gynecological cancers (cervical, endometrial, fallopian tube, gestational trophoblastic disease, ovarian, peritoneal, uterine, vaginal and vulvar), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), malignant melanoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, Merkel cell carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, oligodendrogliomas, ependymoma, glioblastoma multiforme, mixed gliomas, oligoastrocytomas, medulloblastoma, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, germinoma, teratoma, malignant mesothelioma (peritoneal mesothelioma, pericardial mesothelioma, pleural mesothelioma), gastro-entero-pancreatic or gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET), carcinoid, pancreatic endocrine tumor (PET), colorectal adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, aggressive neuroendocrine tumor, leiomyosarcoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, Signet Ring cell adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, hemangioma, hepatic adenoma, focal nodular hyperplasia (nodular regenerative hyperplasia, hamartoma), non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (squamous cell lung carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, large cell lung carcinoma), small cell lung carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, prostate cancer (hormone refractory, androgen independent, androgen dependent, hormone-insensitive), renal cell carcinoma, and soft tissue sarcomas (fibrosarcoma, malignant fibrous hystiocytoma, dermatofibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma leiomyosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor/neurofibrosarcoma, extraskeletal osteosarcoma).
Many tumors of the haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues are characterized by an increase in cell proliferation, or a particular type of cell. The chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPDs) are clonal haematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by proliferation in the bone marrow of one or more of the myeloid lineages, resulting in increased numbers of granulocytes, red blood cells and/or platelets in the peripheral blood. As such, the use of proteasome inhibitors for the treatment of such diseases is attractive and being examined (Cilloni et al., Haematologica (2007) 92: 1124-1229). CMPD can include chronic myelogenous leukaemia, chronic neutrophilic leukaemia, chronic eosinophilic leukaemia, polycythaemia vera, chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythaemia and unclassifiable chronic myeloproliferative disease. An aspect of the invention is the method of treating CMPD comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound disclosed herein.
Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, such as chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia and unclassifiable myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease, are characterized by hypercellularity of the bone marrow due to proliferation in one or more of the myeloid lineages. Inhibiting the proteasome with a compound or composition as described herein can serve to treat these myelodysplatic/myeloproliferative diseases by providing a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of the compound or composition.
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) refer to a group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by dysplasia and ineffective haematopoiesis in one or more of the major myeloid cell lines. Targeting NF-□B with a proteasome inhibitor in these hematologic malignancies induces apoptosis, thereby killing the malignant cell (Braun et al. Cell Death and Differentiation (2006) 13:748-758). A further embodiment of the invention is a method to treat MDS comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a compound disclosed herein. MDS includes refractory anemia, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, refractory anemia with excess blasts, unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome and myelodysplastic syndrome associated with isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality.
Mastocytosis is a proliferation of mast cells and their subsequent accumulation in one or more organ systems. Mastocytosis includes, but is not limited to, cutaneous mastocytosis, indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), systemic mastocytosis with associated clonal haematological non-mast-cell-lineage disease (SM-AHNMD), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), mast cell leukemia (MCL), mast cell sarcoma (MCS) and extracutaneous mastocytoma. Another embodiment of the invention is a method to treat mastocytosis, comprising administering an effective amount of a compound or composition disclosed herein to a subject diagnosed with mastocytosis.
The proteasome regulates NF-κB, which in turn regulates genes involved in the immune and inflammatory response. For example, NF-κB is required for the expression of the immunoglobulin light chain κ gene, the IL-2 receptor α-chain gene, the class I major histocompatibility complex gene, and a number of cytokine genes encoding, for example, IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and IFN-β (Palombella et al., Cell (1994) 78:773-785). Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to methods of affecting the level of expression of IL-2, MHC-I, IL-6, TNFα, IFN-β or any of the other previously-mentioned proteins, each method comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the invention includes a method of treating an autoimmune disease in a mammal comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or composition described herein. An “autoimmune disease” herein is a disease or disorder arising from and directed against an individual's own tissues. Examples of autoimmune diseases or disorders include, but are not limited to, inflammatory responses such as inflammatory skin diseases including psoriasis and dermatitis (e.g., atopic dermatitis); systemic scleroderma and sclerosis; responses associated with inflammatory bowel disease (such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis); respiratory distress syndrome (including adult respiratory distress syndrome; ARDS); dermatitis; meningitis; encephalitis; uveitis; colitis; glomerulonephritis; allergic conditions such as eczema and asthma and other conditions involving infiltration of T cells and chronic inflammatory responses; atherosclerosis; leukocyte adhesion deficiency; rheumatoid arthritis; systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); diabetes mellitus (e.g., Type I diabetes mellitus or insulin dependent diabetes mellitus); multiple sclerosis; Reynaud's syndrome; autoimmune thyroiditis; allergic encephalomyelitis; Sjogren's syndrome; juvenile onset diabetes; and immune responses associated with acute and delayed hypersensitivity mediated by cytokines and T-lymphocytes typically found in tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, polymyositis, granulomatosis and vasculitis; pernicious anemia (Addison's disease); diseases involving leukocyte diapedesis; central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory disorder; multiple organ injury syndrome; hemolytic anemia (including, but not limited to cryoglobinemia or Coombs positive anemia); myasthenia gravis; antigen-antibody complex mediated diseases; anti-glomerular basement membrane disease; antiphospholipid syndrome; allergic neuritis; Graves' disease; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome; pemphigoid bullous; pemphigus; autoimmune polyendocrinopathies; Reiter's disease; stiff-man syndrome; Beheet disease; giant cell arteritis; immune complex nephritis; IgA nephropathy; IgM polyneuropathies; immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
The immune system screens for autologous cells that are virally infected, have undergone oncogenic transformation, or present unfamiliar peptides on their surface. Intracellular proteolysis generates small peptides for presentation to T-lymphocytes to induce MHC class I-mediated immune responses. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method of using the compound as an immunomodulatory agent for inhibiting or altering antigen presentation in a cell, comprising exposing the cell (or administering to a subject) to a compound described herein. Specific embodiments include a method of treating graft or transplant-related diseases, such as graft-versus-host disease or host versus-graft disease in a mammal, comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein. The term “graft” as used herein refers to biological material derived from a donor for transplantation into a recipient. Grafts include such diverse material as, for example, isolated cells such as islet cells; tissue such as the amniotic membrane of a newborn, bone marrow, hematopoietic precursor cells, and ocular tissue, such as corneal tissue; and organs such as skin, heart, liver, spleen, pancreas, thyroid lobe, lung, kidney, tubular organs (e.g., intestine, blood vessels, or esophagus). The tubular organs can be used to replace damaged portions of esophagus, blood vessels, or bile duct. The skin grafts can be used not only for burns, but also as a dressing to damaged intestine or to close certain defects such as diaphragmatic hernia. The graft is derived from any mammalian source, including human, whether from cadavers or living donors. In some cases, the donor and recipient is the same mammal. Preferably the graft is bone marrow or an organ such as heart and the donor of the graft and the host are matched for HLA class II antigens.
Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms are derived from phagocytes and accessory cells, which have major roles in the processing and presentation of antigens to lymphocytes. Depleting the proteasome content in dendritic cells has been shown to alter their antigen-induced responses (Chapatte et al. Cancer Res. (2006) 66:5461-5468). Thus, another embodiment of the invention comprises administering an effective amount of a compound or composition disclosed herein to a subject with histiocytic or dendritic cell neoplasm. Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms include histiocytic sarcoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, Langerhans cell sarcoma, interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma/tumor, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma/tumor and non-specified dendritic cell sarcoma.
Inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to be beneficial to treat diseases whereby a cell type is proliferating and immune disorders; thus, an embodiment of the invention includes the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) associated with primary immune disorders (PID) comprising administering an effective amount of the disclosed compound to a subject in need thereof. The most common clinical settings of immunodeficiency associated with an increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorders, including B-cell and T-cell neoplasms and lymphomas, are primary immunodeficiency syndromes and other primary immune disorders, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), iatrogenic immunosuppression in patients who have received solid organ or bone marrow allografts, and iatrogenic immunosuppression associated with methotrexate treatment. Other PIDs commonly associated with LPDs, but not limited to, are ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (XLP), Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), hyper-IgM syndrome, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS).
Additional embodiments of the invention relate to methods for affecting the proteasome-dependent regulation of oncoproteins and methods of treating or inhibiting cancer growth, each method comprising exposing a cell (in vivo, e.g., in a subject, or in vitro) to the proteasome inhibitor composition disclosed herein. HPV-16 and HPV-18-derived E6 proteins stimulate ATP- and ubiquitin-dependent conjugation and degradation of p53 in crude reticulocyte lysates. The recessive oncogene p53 has been shown to accumulate at the nonpermissive temperature in a cell line with a mutated thermolabile E1. Elevated levels of p53 may lead to apoptosis. Examples of proto-oncoproteins degraded by the ubiquitin system include c-Mos, c-Fos, and c-Jun. In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating p53-related apoptosis, comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor composition disclosed herein.
Another aspect of the invention relates to the use of proteasome inhibitor compositions disclosed herein for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and conditions, including, but not limited to, stroke, ischemic damage to the nervous system, neural trauma (e.g., percussive brain damage, spinal cord injury, and traumatic damage to the nervous system), multiple sclerosis and other immune-mediated neuropathies (e.g., Guillain-Barre syndrome and its variants, acute motor axonal neuropathy, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and Fisher Syndrome), HIV/AIDS dementia complex, axonomy, diabetic neuropathy, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and viral meningitis, encephalitis, vascular dementia, multi-infarct dementia, Lewy body dementia, frontal lobe dementia such as Pick's disease, subcortical dementias (such as Huntington or progressive supranuclear palsy), focal cortical atrophy syndromes (such as primary aphasia), metabolic-toxic dementias (such as chronic hypothyroidism or B12 deficiency), and dementias caused by infections (such as syphilis or chronic meningitis).
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular deposits of β-amyloid protein (β-AP) in senile plaques and cerebral vessels. β-AP is a peptide fragment of 39 to 42 amino acids derived from an amyloid protein precursor (APP). At least three isoforms of APP are known (695, 751, and 770 amino acids). Alternative splicing of mRNA generates the isoforms; normal processing affects a portion of the β-AP sequence, thereby preventing the generation of β-AP. It is believed that abnormal protein processing by the proteasome contributes to the abundance of β-AP in the Alzheimer brain. The APP-processing enzyme in rats contains about ten different subunits (22 kDa-32 kDa). The 25 kDa subunit has an N-terminal sequence of X-Gln-Asn-Pro-Met-X-Thr-Gly-Thr-Ser, which is identical to the β-subunit of human macropain (Kojima, S. et al., Fed. Eur. Biochem. Soc., (1992) 304:57-60). The APP-processing enzyme cleaves at the Gln15--Lys16 bond; in the presence of calcium ion, the enzyme also cleaves at the Met−1--Asp1 bond and the Asp1--Ala2 bond to release the extracellular domain of β-AP.
One aspect of the invention, therefore, relates to a method of treating Alzheimer's disease, comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein. Such treatment includes reducing the rate of β-AP processing, reducing the rate of β-AP plaque formation, reducing the rate of β-AP generation, and reducing the clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease.
In some embodiments, a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein can be useful for treating amyloidosis. Accordingly, provided herein is a method for treating amyloidosis is a subject, comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein.
Fibrosis is the excessive and persistent formation of fibrous connective tissue resulting from the hyperproliferative growth of fibroblasts and is associated with activation of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Fibrosis involves extensive deposition of extracellular matrix and can occur within virtually any tissue or across several different tissues. Normally, the level of intracellular signaling protein (Smad) that activates transcription of target genes upon TGF-β stimulation is regulated by proteasome activity (Xu et al., 2000). However, accelerated degradation of the TGF-β signaling components has been observed in fibrotic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, injection fibrosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, myelofibrosis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, progressive massive fibrosis, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Other conditions that are often associated with fibrosis include cirrhosis, diffuse parenchymal lung disease, post-vasectomy pain syndrome, tuberculosis, sickle-cell anemia and rheumatoid arthritis. An embodiment of the invention is the method of treating a fibrotic or fibrotic-associated condition comprising administering an effective amount of the composition described herein to a subject in need of such treatment.
The treatment of burn victims is often hampered by fibrosis. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to the topical or systemic administration of a subject inhibitor to treat burns. Wound closure following surgery is often associated with disfiguring scars, which may be prevented by inhibition of fibrosis. Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for the prevention or reduction of scarring.
Overproduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines such as TNFα is considered to be central to the processes associated with septic shock. Furthermore, it is generally accepted that the first step in the activation of cells by LPS is the binding of LPS to specific membrane receptors. The α- and β-subunits of the 20S proteasome complex have been identified as LPS-binding proteins, suggesting that the LPS-induced signal transduction may be an important therapeutic target in the treatment or prevention of sepsis (Qureshi, N. et al., J. Immun. (2003) 171: 1515-1525). Therefore, in certain embodiments, the proteasome inhibitor composition may be used for the inhibition of TNFα to prevent and/or treat septic shock.
Ischemia and reperfusion injury results in hypoxia, a condition in which there is a deficiency of oxygen reaching the tissues of the body. This condition causes increased degradation of Iκ-Bα, thereby resulting in the activation of NF-κB (Koong et al., 1994). It has been demonstrated that the severity of injury resulting in hypoxia can be reduced with the administration of a proteasome inhibitor (Gao, et al., 2000; Bao, et al., 2001; Pye, et al., 2003). Therefore, certain embodiments of the invention relate to a method of treating an ischemic condition or reperfusion injury comprising administering to a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of the proteasome inhibitor compound disclosed herein. Examples of such conditions or injuries include, but are not limited to, acute coronary syndrome (vulnerable plaques), arterial occlusive disease (cardiac, cerebral, peripheral arterial and vascular occlusions), atherosclerosis (coronary sclerosis, coronary artery disease), infarctions, heart failure, pancreatitis, myocardial hypertrophy, stenosis, and restenosis.
NF-κB also binds specifically to the HIV-enhancer/promoter. When compared to the Nef of mac239, the HIV regulatory protein Nef of pbj14 differs by two amino acids in the region which controls protein kinase binding. It is believed that the protein kinase signals the phosphorylation of IκB, triggering IκB degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. After degradation, NF-κB is released into the nucleus, thus enhancing the transcription of HIV (Cohen, J., Science, (1995) 267:960). In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for inhibiting or reducing HIV infection in a subject, or a method for decreasing the level of viral gene expression, each method comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein.
Viral infections contribute to the pathology of many diseases. Heart conditions such as ongoing myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy have been linked to the coxsackievirus B3. In a comparative whole-genome microarray analyses of infected mouse hearts, specific proteasome subunits were uniformly up-regulated in hearts of mice which developed chronic myocarditis (Szalay et al, Am J Pathol 168:1542-52, 2006). Some viruses utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the viral entry step where the virus is released from the endosome into the cytosol. The mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which also includes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. Yu and Lai (J Virol 79:644-648, 2005) demonstrated that treatment of cells infected with MHV with a proteasome inhibitor resulted in a decrease in viral replication, correlating with reduced viral titer as compared to that of untreated cells. The human hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the Hepadnaviridae virus family, likewise requires virally encoded envelop proteins to propagate. Inhibiting the proteasome degradation pathway causes a significant reduction in the amount of secreted envelope proteins (Simsek et al, J Virol 79:12914-12920, 2005). In addition to HBV, other hepatitis viruses (A, C, D and E) may also utilize the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway for secretion, morphogenesis and pathogenesis. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating viral infection, such as SARS or hepatitis A, B, C, D and E, comprising contacting a cell with (or administering to a subject) an effective amount of a compound or composition disclosed herein.
In certain embodiments, the disclosed compositions may be useful for the treatment of a parasitic infection, such as infections caused by protozoan parasites. The proteasome of these parasites is considered to be involved primarily in cell differentiation and replication activities (Paugam et al., Trends Parasitol. 2003, 19(2): 55-59). Furthermore, entamoeba species have been shown to lose encystation capacity when exposed to proteasome inhibitors (Gonzales, et al., Arch. Med. Res. 1997, 28, Spec No: 139-140). In certain such embodiments, the administrative protocols for the proteasome inhibitor compositions are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in humans caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium sps. (including P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale, which cause malaria), Trypanosoma sps. (including T. cruzi, which causes Chagas' disease, and T. brucei which causes African sleeping sickness), Leishmania sps. (including L. amazonesis, L. donovani, L. infantum, L. mexicana, etc.), Pneumocystis carinii (a protozoan known to cause pneumonia in AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients), Toxoplasma gondii, Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba invadens, and Giardia lamblia.
In certain embodiments, the disclosed proteasome inhibitor compositions are useful for the treatment of parasitic infections in animals and livestock caused by a protozoan parasite selected from Plasmodium hermani, Cryptosporidium sps., Echinococcus granulosus, Eimeria tenella, Sarcocystis neurona, and Neurospora crassa. Other compounds that act as proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of parasitic diseases are described in WO 98/10779, which is incorporated herein in its entirety.
In certain embodiments, the proteasome inhibitor compositions inhibit proteasome activity in a parasite without recovery in red blood cells and white blood cells. In certain such embodiments, the long half-life of blood cells may provide prolonged protection with regard to therapy against recurring exposures to parasites. In certain embodiments, the proteasome inhibitor compositions may provide prolonged protection with regard to chemoprophylaxis against future infection.
Prokaryotes have an equivalent to the eukaryote 20S proteasome particle. Although the subunit composition of the prokaryote 20S particle is simpler than that of eukaryotes, it has the ability to hydrolyze peptide bonds in a similar manner. For example, the nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond occurs through the threonine residue on the N-terminus of the β-subunits. Thus, an embodiment of this invention relates to a method of treating prokaryotic infections, comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of a proteasome inhibitor compound or composition disclosed herein. Prokaryotic infections may include diseases caused by either mycobacteria (such as tuberculosis, leprosy or Buruli ulcer) or archaebacteria.
It has also been demonstrated that inhibitors that bind to the 20S proteasome stimulate bone formation in bone organ cultures. Furthermore, when such inhibitors have been administered systemically to mice, certain proteasome inhibitors increased bone volume and bone formation rates over 70% (Garrett, I. R. et al., J. Clin. Invest. (2003) 111: 1771-1782), therefore suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome machinery regulates osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. Therefore, a disclosed proteasome inhibitor compound or composition may be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of diseases associated with bone loss, such as osteoporosis.
Thus, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating a disease or condition selected from cancer, autoimmune disease, graft or transplant-related condition, neurodegenerative disease, fibrotic-associated condition, ischemic-related conditions, infection (viral, parasitic or prokaryotic) and diseases associated with bone loss, comprising administering a compound or composition as disclosed herein.

The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (24 L/kg of Compound (G)), and the organic layer was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (12 L/kg of Compound (G)) and with saturated sodium chloride (12 L/kg of Compound (G)).
The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure with a bath temperature of less than 30° C. to 15 L/kg of Compound (G), followed by co-distillation with isopropyl acetate (2×24 L/kg of PR-022). Final volume was adjusted to 82 L/kg of Compound (G) with isopropyl acetate before heating to 60° C. to obtain a clear solution. The clear solution mixture was allowed to cool to 50° C. before adding seed crystals. The solution was allowed to cool to 20° C., when substantial crystallization of Compound 1 had occurred. The suspension was stirred at 0° C. for 12 hours before filtration and rinsing with isopropyl acetate (2 L/kg of Compound 1). Compound 1 was dried under vacuum at 20° C. for 12 hours to constant weight. Yield of Compound 1 was 48%, with HPLC purity of 97.4%.

Tablet Compression and Coating
Tablets weighing about 78 to about 80 mg, about 150 mg to about 156 mg, and about 600 mg with 25 mg, 50 mg and 200 mg drug loading were compressed with round standard concave 9/32″, 13/32″ or 15/32″ tooling respectively using a Carver Press or single station press or a rotary tablet pressTablets were compressed at predetermined pressure and evaluated for thickness and hardnessTablet characteristics and process parameters are documentedTablets prepared are stored at room temperature (“RT”) until further processed or usedTablets were film coated using a perforated pan coater with Opadry II® 85F18422 which is an immediate release coating polymer formulation marketed by Colorcon®
Tablet Characterization
Tablets prepared were characterized for thickness, hardness, friability and dissolution characteristics. The tablet granulation was characterized for compressibility index and particle size distributionThickness was measured using a VWR Electronic Digital Caliper®Hardness was measured using a Caleva THT-15® hardness testerDissolution was performed with USP Type II Paddle apparatus at 75 rpm in pH 5.5 buffer using an Agilent VK 700® dissolution apparatus and VK8000® Dissolution Sampling StationDissolution samples were analyzed using an Agilent 1260 Infinity® HPLC system with Agilent 1200® auto sampler and DAD detector
Example 3. Statistical Analysis
Either student t-tests or ANOVA was performed for the statistical analysis of the data using GraphPad Prism® software when required. Similarity factor (f2) was also calculated to compare the dissolution profiles.
Example 4. Formulation Release Profiles
[1] Since the tablet formulations were manufactured manually by hand using one of the following: Carver press, single station press, or rotary tablet press, the uniformity of the tablets prepared were monitored by measuring the thickness and weights of all the tablets and hardness on a few of them. The desired tablet thickness was defined to be in the range of about 2.5 millimeters to about 4.0 millimeters as measured by the digital calipers. The tablet can have a thickness of from about 3.0 millimeters to about 3.77 millimeters, e.g., about 3.04 mm; e.g., about 3.75 mm.
Tablets outside the desired thickness range were rejected. The tablet hardness is inversely proportional to the thickness (for the current working range) and the thickness and hardness of the tablets were well correlated. The desired average tablet hardness strength was between about 1.00 to about 25.00 kp, e.g., about 5 kp. e.g., about 8 kp.
Example 5. Stability Study
The stability of oprozomib tablets prepared and stored at room temperature for more than 1 month were evaluated for assay and impurities and were found to be acceptable without any anomalous peaks implying stability at RT. In some embodiments, the 25 mg and 50 mg formulations of Table 1 are stable upon actual or simulated storage at open conditions at 25° C./60% relative humidity for at least 1 month.
In some embodiments, the 25 mg formulation of Table 1a, which comprises a desiccant, preferably a hydrophilic silica, is stable upon actual or simulated storage at open conditions at 40° C./75% RH for at least 1 month (FIG. 12). After multiple experiments with different grades of silicon dioxide as the desiccant, the most preferred silicon dioxide to employ in the formulation is porous and has a surface area of about 500 to about 1000 m2/g, most preferably about 700 m2/g. The most preferred silicon dioxide has an average pore volume of about 0.2 to about 1 cc/g, most preferably about 0.4 cc/g. The silicon dioxide used in the formulation of Table 1a is Syloid® 63FP, commercially available from W.R. Grace (Columbia, Md.).
FIG. 13 is a graph showing the different dissolution profiles of experimental formulations of Table 1a using a different grade of silicon dioxide, Cab-o-sil® M-5P (Cabot Corp., Boston, Mass.), than in FIG. 12. When the formulation storage time is T=0 (Initial), the release profile is consistent with previous release profiles of the Table 1a formulation. However, the slow down in release profile of the formulation after T=1 month is inconsistent and not desirable for a commercial formulation due to the NVD adverse events associated with the slow down in the release of oprozomib in the GI tract. Table 7 below compares the properties of the different grades of silicon dioxide employed:

Stability studies were carried out using one of the following procedures:(i) Tablets were packaged in 75 cc white HDPE bottles with closures and stored at 30° C.±2° C./65% relative humidity (RH)±5% RH and 40° C.±2° C./75% RH±5% RH. Tablets were tested for appearance, hardness, assay and impurities and dissolution at pre-determined time points.(ii) Tablets were packaged in 75 cc white HDPE bottles with closures and desiccant and stored at 5° C.±3° C., 25° C.±2° C./60% relative humidity (RH)±5% RH and 40° C.±2° C./75% RH±5% RH. Tablets were tested for appearance, hardness, assay and impurities and dissolution at pre-determined time points.(iii) In preferred embodiments, when the formulation is stored in a 75 cc HDPE bottle with desiccant at 5° C.±3° C., for at least 1 month, the formulation shows less than about 1.0% degradation of oprozomib. In more preferred embodiments, the amount of degradation of oprozomib is less than 0.5%, 0.4%, 0.3%, 0.2%, and in some instances, less than 0.1%.(iv) To investigate and improve the slowdown in the dissolution profile of the formulations of Tables 1 and 1a, with different grades of desiccant (FIGS. 12 and 13), stability studies were conducted under open conditions at 40° C.±2° C./75% RH±5% RH.
Example 6. PK/PD Studies
PK/PD studies were conducted using the present IR formulations as described in Table 1: an oral suspension, wherein the suspension is a 1.2 mg/mL oprozomib suspension in 1% carboxymethylcellulose sodium (medium viscosity 400-800 cP) vehicle; and an extended release formulation as described in FIG. 11.
In vivo dog data show that oprozomib administration using IR formulations reduced GI intolerability (such as emesis (vomiting) events and increased salivation) relative to ER formulation while maintaining the PK/PD activity (FIGS. 7, 8, 9 and 10). Female dogs were administered a single dose of 60 mg/kg oprozomib in oral suspension, immediate release, or ER formulations. Blood samples were collected from pre-dose to 24 hours post-dose for plasma PK parameter determination and blood PD analyses of proteasome inhibition (see FIG. 8). GI tolerability were recorded up to 48 hours post-dose (FIG. 10). The area under the plasma concentration curve to the last time point (AUClast) and maximum concentration (Cmax) exposures were superior for the IR formulation relative to the ER (FIG. 7). The IR formulations had a time to peak plasma concentrations of from about 30 minutes to about 45 minutes. Rapid potent inhibition of proteasome activity (100% of pre-dose) was observed for the IR formulations (FIG. 9). IR formulations caused less GI intolerability than the ER formulations (FIG. 10). Following a 60 mg/kg dose, the immediate formulations caused only one emesis event and no increased salivation event while the ER formulation caused a total of 8 increased salivation events on Days 8 and 9. As such, the formulations described herein can provide a reduced incidence or severity of one or more GI side effects (e.g., NVD, increased salivation).
A single dose of the formulation comprising 60 mg of oprozomib to a dog produces peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of oprozomib of 66.4 ng/mL (having a standard deviation of 73.3).
The administration of the formulation to a dog produces an area under the concentration time curve to the last time point (AUC) of oprozomib of 28.6 ng*hr/mL, having standard deviation of 18.6).
Example 7. Oprozomib Dosing Regimen
Dogs were dosed once a week on a one time basis, e.g., Day 1 and Day 8. Patients are expected to be administered oprozomib formulated in a tablet form according to either a QD×2 treatment schedule or QD×2 weekly treatment schedule. As used herein, “QD×2” means that patients receive oprozomib tablets once daily on days 1-2 of a 7-day treatment schedule. Patients may be administered oprozomib formulated in a tablet where the patient receives oprozomib on days one through 2 of a seven day treatment schedule.
The formulations of oprozomib may be administered with or without food; however, the formulations are preferably administered with a low fat meal.
