T1	REACTION_SPAN 46505 47177	A mixture of the obtained ester, pentaerythrityl tetrabromide (5.82 g, 15 mmol), potassium carbonate (10.35 g, 75 mmol), and DMF (40 mL) was stirred under argon and heated at 110Â° C. for 24 h. After cooling, the mixture was poured into ice/water (200 mL) and extracted with hexane/ethyl acetate (200+200 mL). The extract was washed with water (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. Column chromatography of the residue (silica gel-hexane/ethyl acetate, 9:1) gave Compound B11, diisobutyl 3,3'-((2-(bromomethyl)-2-((3-(isobutoxycarbonyl)phenoxy)methyl)propane-1,3-diyl)bis(oxy))dibenzoate, (4.27 g, 39% yield).
