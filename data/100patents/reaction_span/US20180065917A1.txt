BACKGROUND
Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) also known as cluster of differentiation 274 (CD274) or B7 homolog 1 (B7-H1) is a 40 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein. PD-L1 is expressed on a variety of cell types, including placenta, vascular endothelium, pancreatic islet cells, muscle, hepatocytes, epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, as well as on B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells. Interaction of PD-L1 with programmed death receptor (PD-1; also known as CD279) expressed on T cells (particularly on activated T cells) results in reduced T-cell proliferation and cytokine expression to help control local inflammatory responses and maintain self-tolerance. Tumor cells have co-opted the PD-1/PD-L1 regulatory mechanism to avoid immunologic surveillance, facilitating cancer growth.
Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction would restore the function of chronically exhausted tumor-specific T cells and decrease tumor-induced immune suppression.
General examples of PD-L1 antagonists or inhibitors include an antibody or antigen-binding fragment or small molecule that specifically binds to PD-L1 and reduces one or more of its immune-suppressive activities, for example, its binding to the PD-1 receptor. Specific examples of PD-L1 antagonists include the antibodies atezolizumab (MPDL3280A), avelumab (MSB0010718C), and durvalumab (MEDI4736), and antigen-binding fragments thereof.
However, there remains a significant need for compounds that effectively and specifically inhibit the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 in a clinical setting, as well as for associated compositions and methods. The present invention satisfies this need and provides further related advantages.
SUMMARY
The present invention generally relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of the functional interaction between PD-L1 and its receptors programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and CD80 (B7-1). Such compounds may either completely disrupt binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 and/or CD80 or block or attenuate signal transduction through these receptors. Inhibitors of the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 are useful in the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases.
In one embodiment the invention is directed to compounds according to Formula (I):

The term “compound” refers to a chemical entity, whether in the solid, liquid or gaseous phase, and whether in a crude mixture or purified and isolated. The compound of the invention can exist in various isomeric forms, as well as in one or more tautomeric forms, including both single tautomers and mixtures of tautomers. The term “isomer” is intended to encompass all isomeric forms of a compound of this invention, including tautomeric forms of the compound.
Some compounds described here can have asymmetric centers and therefore exist in different enantiomeric and diastereomeric forms. A compound of the invention can be in the form of an optical isomer or a diastereomer. Accordingly, the invention encompasses compounds of the invention and their uses as described herein in the form of their optical isomers, diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof, including a racemic mixture. Optical isomers of the compounds of the invention can be obtained by known techniques such as asymmetric synthesis, chiral chromatography, or via chemical separation of stereoisomers through the employment of optically active resolving agents.
Unless otherwise indicated, “stereoisomer” means one stereoisomer of a compound that is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. Thus, a stereomerically pure compound having one chiral center will be substantially free of the opposite enantiomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure compound having two chiral centers will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, for example greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound.
If there is a discrepancy between a depicted structure and a name given to that structure, then the depicted structure controls. Additionally, if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. In some cases, however, where more than one chiral center exists, the structures and names may be represented as single enantiomers to help describe the relative stereochemistry. Those skilled in the art of organic synthesis will know if the compounds are prepared as single enantiomers from the methods used to prepare them.
In this description, a “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” is a pharmaceutically acceptable, organic or inorganic acid or base salt of a compound of the invention. Representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, e.g., alkali metal salts, alkali earth salts, ammonium salts, water-soluble and water-insoluble salts, such as the acetate, amsonate (4,4-diaminostilbene-2,2-disulfonate), benzenesulfonate, benzonate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, butyrate, calcium, calcium edetate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, citrate, clavulariate, dihydrochloride, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, fiunarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, glycollylarsanilate, hexafluorophosphate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide, methylnitrate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine ammonium salt, 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate (1,1-methene-bis-2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate, einbonate), pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, picrate, polygalacturonate, propionate, p-toluenesulfonate, salicylate, stearate, subacetate, succinate, sulfate, sulfosaliculate, suramate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide, trifluoroacetate and valerate salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have more than one charged atom in its structure. In this instance the pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have multiple counterions. Thus, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can have one or more charged atoms and/or one or more counterions.
The terms “treat”, “treating” and “treatment” refer to the amelioration or eradication of a disease or symptoms associated with a disease. In certain embodiments, such terms refer to minimizing the spread or worsening of the disease resulting from the administration of one or more prophylactic or therapeutic agents to a patient with such a disease. In the context of the present invention the terms “treat”, “treating” and “treatment” also refer to:(i) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;(ii) inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development;(iii) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease or condition; or(iv) relieving the symptoms resulting from the disease or condition, i.e., relieving pain without addressing the underlying disease or condition. As used herein, the terms “disease” and “condition” may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.
The terms “modulate”, “modulation” and the like refer to the ability of a compound to increase or decrease the function, or activity of, for example, the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L. “Modulation”, in its various forms, is intended to encompass inhibition, antagonism, partial antagonism, activation, agonism and/or partial agonism of the activity associated with PD-1 and PD-L1. PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors are compounds that bind to, partially or totally block stimulation, decrease, prevent, delay activation, inactivate, desensitize, or down regulate signal transduction. The ability of a compound to modulate PD-1 or PD-L1 activity can be demonstrated in a suitable enzymatic assay or a suitable cell-based assay.
A “patient” or “subject” includes an animal, such as a human, cow, horse, sheep, lamb, pig, chicken, turkey, quail, cat, dog, mouse, rat, rabbit or guinea pig. The animal can be a mammal such as a non-primate and a primate (e.g., monkey and human). In one embodiment, a patient is a human, such as a human infant, child, adolescent or adult.
The term “prodrug” refers to a precursor of a drug, a compound which upon administration to a patient must undergo chemical conversion by metabolic processes before becoming an active pharmacological agent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent compound. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent compound is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A prodrug may be converted into the parent drug by various mechanisms, including enzymatic processes and metabolic hydrolysis. Typical examples of prodrugs include compounds that have biologically labile protecting groups on a functional moiety of the active compound. Prodrugs include compounds that can be oxidized, reduced, aminated, deaminated, hydroxylated, dehydroxylated, hydrolyzed, dehydrolyzed, alkylated, dealkylated, acylated, deacylated, phosphorylated, dephosphorylated to produce the active compound. Exemplary prodrugs of compounds in accordance with Formula (I) are esters, acetamides, and amides.
The inventive compounds according to Formula (I) may be isotopically-labeled by having one or more atoms replaced by an atom having a different atomic mass or mass number. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of according to Formula (I) include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine, chlorine, or iodine. Illustrative of such isotopes are 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C, 14C, 13N, 15N, 15O, 17O, 18O, 31p, 32P, 35S, 18F, 36Cl, 123I, and 125I, respectively. These radiolabeled compounds can be used to measure the biodistribution, tissue concentration and the kinetics of transport and excretion from biological tissues including a subject to which such a labeled compound is administered. Labeled compounds are also used to determine therapeutic effectiveness, the site or mode of action, and the binding affinity of a candidate therapeutic to a pharmacologically important target. Certain radioactive-labeled compounds according to Formula (I), therefore, are useful in drug and/or tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, affords certain therapeutic advantages resulting from the greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life of compounds containing deuterium. Substitution of hydrogen with deuterium may reduce dose required for therapeutic effect, and hence may be preferred in a discovery or clinical setting. Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 1C, 18F, 5O and 13N, provides labeled analogs of the inventive compounds that are useful in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, e.g., for examining substrate receptor occupancy. Isotopically-labeled compounds according to Formula (I) can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Preparations and Examples section as set out below using an appropriate isotopic-labeling reagent.
Embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are also meant to encompass the in vivo metabolic products of compounds according to Formula (I). Such products may result from, for example, the oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, and like processes primarily due to enzymatic activity upon administration of a compound of the invention. Accordingly, the invention includes compounds that are produced as by-products of enzymatic or non-enzymatic activity on an inventive compound following the administration of such a compound to a mammal for a period of time sufficient to yield a metabolic product. Metabolic products, particularly pharmaceutically active metabolites are typically identified by administering a radiolabeled compound of the invention in a detectable dose to a subject, such as rat, mouse, guinea pig, monkey, or human, for a sufficient period of time during which metabolism occurs, and isolating the metabolic products from urine, blood or other biological samples that are obtained from the subject receiving the radiolabeled compound.
The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of Formula (I) compounds. Encompassed within the scope of the invention are both acid and base addition salts that are formed by contacting a pharmaceutically suitable acid or a pharmaceutically suitable base with a compound of the invention.
To this end, a “pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable, and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, but are not limited to, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as, but not limited to, acetic acid, 2,2-dichloroacetic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, ascorbic acid, aspartic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, benzoic acid, 4-acetamidobenzoic acid, camphoric acid, camphor-10-sulfonic acid, capric acid, caproic acid, caprylic acid, carbonic acid, cinnamic acid, citric acid, cyclamic acid, dodecylsulfuric acid, ethane-1,2-disulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, galactaric acid, gentisic acid, glucoheptonic acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, glutamic acid, glutaric acid, 2-oxo-glutaric acid, glycerophosphoric acid, glycolic acid, hippuric acid, isobutyric acid, lactic acid, lactobionic acid, lauric acid, laurylsulfate, maleic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, mucic acid, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic acid, naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid, 1-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, nicotinic acid, oleic acid, orotic acid, oxalic acid, palmitic acid, pamoic acid, propionic acid, pyroglutamic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, 4-aminosalicylic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, sterylsulfate, succinic acid, tartaric acid, thiocyanic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, undecylenic acid, and the like.
Similarly, a “pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are prepared by addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the free acid. Salts derived from inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Preferred inorganic salts are the ammonium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as ammonia, isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, diethanolamine, ethanolamine, deanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, 2-diethylaminoethanol, dicyclohexylamine, lysine, arginine, histidine, caffeine, procaine, hydrabamine, choline, betaine, benethamine, benzathine, ethylenediamine, glucosamine, meglumine, theobromine, triethanolamine, tromethamine, purines, piperazine, piperidine, N-ethylpiperidine, polyamine resins and the like. Particularly preferred organic bases are isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, trimethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, choline and caffeine.
Often crystallizations produce a solvate of the compound of the invention. As used herein, the term “solvate” refers to an aggregate that comprises one or more molecules of a compound of the invention with one or more molecules of solvent. The solvent may be water, in which case the solvate may be a hydrate. Alternatively, the solvent may be an organic solvent. Thus, the compounds of the present invention may exist as a hydrate, including a monohydrate, dihydrate, hemihydrate, sesquihydrate, trihydrate, tetrahydrate and the like, as well as the corresponding solvated forms. The compound of the invention may be true solvates, while in other cases, the compound of the invention may merely retain adventitious water or be a mixture of water plus some adventitious solvent.
A “stereoisomer” refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures, which are not interchangeable. The present invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and includes “enantiomers”, which refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperimposeable mirror images of one another.
Compounds of the invention or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L)- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (−), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallization. Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.
The term “tautomer” refers to a proton shift from one atom of a molecule to another atom of the same molecule.
The inventive compounds are synthesized using conventional synthetic methods, and more specifically using the general methods noted below.

General Synthetic Schemes
R1, R2, X1, Y1 and n are previously defined for Formula I and these definitions are utilized in the schemes below.
Compounds of Formula I can be prepared from symmetrical biphenyl intermediates III where R1a is CH3, CH2OH, CH2OPG, CHO, CO2R2 and PG is a Protecting Group.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00003.TIF </img>
Symmetrical biphenyl can be synthesized by starting with commercially or readily available benzene derivatives II employing one of several methods described in the literature.
Comprehensive reviews of biphenyls include Jain, Z. J., et al. ArJChem. 2017 10, S2051, Hassan, Chem. Rev., 2002, 102, pg. 1359, Bringmann, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 1990, 29, pg. 977 and Sainsbury, Tetrahedron, 1980, 36, pg. 3327.
In one approach symmetrical biphenyls of Formula III can be directly formed by the dimerization of II via metal catalysis where Lv is a Leaving Group such as halogen, OSO2CH3, OSO2Ar or OSO2CF3.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00004.TIF </img>
In a second synthetic approach symmetrical biphenyls of Formula III can be synthesized via a Suzuki-Miyaura reaction (see Miyaura, N., Suzuki, A. Chem. Rev. 1995, 95, 2457., Kotha, S. et al. Tetrahedron 2002, 58, 9633, Broutin, P., et al., Org. Lett. 2004, 6 (24), 4419 and Molander, G. A., et al., Aldrichimica Acta 2005, 38, 49). In this versatile method, benzene derivatives II can first be converted to a boron species IIA where B is a boron species such as B(OH)2, B(O-alkyl)2, BF3K, or Bpin.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00005.TIF </img>
Benzene derivative II can them be subjected to palladium catalyzed conditions with boron species IIA to form biphenyls of Formula III.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00006.TIF </img>
To further transform intermediate biphenyls of Formula III to the biphenyl bis-ethers of Formula IV, the R1a group must first be converted to a hydroxymethylene moiety if not already in place. Intermediate IIIA (R1a is CH2OH) can then be subjected to an ether forming reaction with an appropriate phenol under Mitsunobu conditions to form biphenyl bis-ethers of Formula IV where R1b is CH2OH, CH2OPG, CHO, CO2R2, CH2NH2 or CH2NHPG. For a review of the Mitsunobu reaction see Fletcher, S., Org. Chem. Front. 2015, 2, 739.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00007.TIF </img>
Alternatively IIIA may first be converted to IIIB which can then be combined with an appropriate phenol under anionic nucleophilic reaction conditions including sodium hydride in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and potassium carbonate in acetone to form biphenyl bis-ethers of Formula IV.
<img> id-US20180065917A1-20180308-C00008.TIF </img>
Functional group R1b of intermediate IV can either then be used to directly incorporate the substituted alkyl groups designated as (CH2)nY1 of Formula I, or first converted to an alternative functional group required to transform IV to I. For example when R1b is an aldehyde it may be subjected to reductive alkylation or carbon homologation transformations.

PD-L1/PD-1 Interaction Assay
The ability of compounds to block PD-L1/PD-1 complex formation was evaluated using biochemical interaction assay based on the ELISA platform.
EIA/RIA high binding 96-well plates (Costar) were coated with human PD-1-Fc protein diluted in PBS to 0.5 μg/ml overnight at 4° C. The PD-1-Fc coated plates were washed in PBST and blocked in blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBST). Serially diluted compounds were pre-incubated with PD-L1-Fc-biotin (0.1 μg/ml final) for 2 hours on a shaker at room temperature. The PD-1-Fc coated plates were washed with PBST and solutions containing PD-L1 and compounds were added to the plates. The PD-1-Fc coated plates were incubated with PD-L1 and compound solution for 2 hours on a shaker at room temperature. After the incubation unbound PD-L1 was washed away with PBST and plates were incubated with the blocking buffer for 10 minutes. The bound PD-L1-Fc-biotin was detected with streptavidin-HRP and TMB substrate. The plates were read at OD450 nm in a plate reader (i3 from Molecular Devices) and percentages of inhibition of PD-L1/PD-1 complex formation were calculated.
PD-1-Fc protein was made at Polaris and PD-L1-Fc was purchased from BPS Bioscience. The IC50 values measured in the assay and shown in Table 1 were in the following ranges: A=0.0001-0.010 μM; B=0.011-0.10 μM; C=0.11-1.00 μM; D=1.01-30.0 μM; E>30.0 μM or no activity observed at concentrations >30.0 μM.
