The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with water (200 mL). 4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)nitrobenzene was isolated as a white solid by suction filtration (1.12 g).
T2	REACTION_SPAN 69774 70278	4-(Prop-2-ynyloxy)nitrobenzene (0.910 g, 5.13 mmol), iron (1.42 g, 25.3 mmol), and NH4Cl (0.719g, 12.8 mmol) were vigorously stirred in EtOH/water (1:1, 55 mL) at 70 °C for 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was filtered hot through diatomaceous earth and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was suspended in 10% 2N ammoniacal methanol in dichloromethane, sonicated, and filtered through diatomaceous earth. Concentration gave 4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)aniline as an oil which was used without further purification.
T3	REACTION_SPAN 70397 71031	4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)aniline (0.750 g, 5.10 mmol) and 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoropyrimidine (1.27 g, 0.760 mmol, commercially available from Sigma-Aldrich of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) were stirred in MeOH/water (4:1, 35 mL) at room temperature for 18h. The reaction mixture was diluted with EtOAc (200 mL) and washed with IN HCl (50 mL) and brine (50 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexanes ramped to EtOAc:hexanes (1:10)) to provide 2-chloro-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-4-pyrimidineamine as a light brown solid (0.514 g).
T4	REACTION_SPAN 71229 71861	2-Chloro-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-4-pyrimidineamine (0.514 g, 1.85 mmol), 3-(aminosulfonyl)-4-methylaniline (0.689 g, 3.70 mmol, made by reduction of commercially available 2-methyl-5-nitrobenzenesulfonamide or synthesized as described below), and trifluoroacetic acid (0.186 mL, 2.41 mmol) were combined with iPrOH (6.0 mL) in a sealed vial and heated at 100°C for 3h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and diluted with IN HCl (80 mL). N2-(3-Aminosulfonyl-4-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine (I) was isolated as a white solid by suction filtration (0.703 g).
T5	REACTION_SPAN 72159 72268;72269 73028	II: 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine N2-(3-Aminosulfonyl-4-methylphenyl)-5-fluoro-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, I, (0.200 g, 0.467 mmol), DMAP (40 mg, 0.33 mmol)) and triethylamine (0.118 mL, 0.847 mmol) were stirred in THF (6.0 mL). Propionic anhydride (0.180 mL, 1.40 mmol) was added to the solution drop wise. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The solution was diluted with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and washed with water (5 x 25 mL) and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was dried (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated. The residue was suspended in ethyl acetate (25 mL), sonicated and the solid collected by filtration to give 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, II, (0.20 g).
T6	REACTION_SPAN 73414 73541;73542 73949	III: 5-fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine mono-sodium salt 5-Fluoro-N2-(4-methyl-3-propionylaminosulfonylphenyl)-N4-[4-(prop-2-ynyloxy)phenyl]-2,4-pyrimidinediamine, II, (0.125 g, 0.258 mmol) was suspended in acetonitrile (1.5 mL) and water (1.5 mL) and cooled in an ice bath. A solution of IN NaOH aq. (0.260 mL) was added drop wise. The reaction mixture was stirred until it became clear, filtered through glass wool, and lyophilized to give the sodium salt of II.
