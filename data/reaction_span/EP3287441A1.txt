Technical Field
The present invention relates to a novel compound or a salt thereof which can have an inhibitory effect on serine palmitoyltransferase (hereinafter, also referred to as "SPT"). The present invention further relates to a medicament which can be useful for the prevention or treatment of SPT-related diseases including cancer and congenital diseases associated with sphingolipid accumulation including Niemann-Pick disease, etc., comprising the compound or a salt thereof.
[Background of the invention]
SPT is an enzyme that catalyzes the reaction through which L-serine and palmitoyl coenzyme A are condensed to synthesize 3-ketodihydrosphingosine, and is involved in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. SPT is constituted by a plurality of subunits. 3 types of SPT subunits are known: SPT1 (also called SPTLC1), SPT2 (also called SPTLC2) and SPT3 (also called SPTLC3). A complex consisting of subunits SPT1 and SPT2 and a complex consisting of subunits SPT1 and SPT3 are known as SPT as a subunit complex.
The sphingolipids include ceramide, sphingomyelin, ganglioside and the like. The sphingolipids are constituents of cell membranes and are known to play an important role in maintenance of homeostasis of the membranes and signal transduction while having various physiological activities. Myriocin, which has an inhibitory effect on SPT, is known to inhibit the growth of activated lymphocytes, to inhibit the growth of mouse melanoma cell lines, and to exhibit an antitumor effect on mouse melanoma tumor models (Non Patent Literature 1).
Compounds described in Patent Literatures 1 to 6, etc., have been known so far as compounds having an antitumor effect.

Test Example 1 SPT enzyme inhibition test
Full-length human SPT1, human SPT2 and human ssSPTa used had amino acid sequences identical to NCBI Accession Nos. NM_006415, NM_004863 and NM_138288, respectively. pcDNA3.1 vectors having an insert of a sequence of interest were prepared, and FreeStyle 293 cells (Life Technologies, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, US) were cotransfected with the human SPT1, human SPT2, and human ssSPTa expression vectors according to the protocol of FreeStyle 293 Expression system. After culture for 3 days, the cells were recovered and frozen at -80°C to obtain expressing cells. The frozen cells were suspended in a 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 250 mM sucrose, 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and Complete, EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science, Penzberg, Upper Bavaria, Germany). The cells were disrupted (on ice, 20,000 rpm, 20 sec × 2) using POLYTORON (Central Scientific Commerce, Inc.). After centrifugation at 2000 rpm (850 × g) for 10 minutes, the supernatant was recovered. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (186,010 × g) for 60 minutes, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellets were suspended in a 50 mM Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and Complete, EDTA-free, passed through a 40-µm cell strainer and stored at -80°C. The resultant was used as a SPT2-expressing membrane fraction. The protein concentration was determined using CBB Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin used as standards.
5 µL of each test compound was mixed with 10 µL of the 100 µg/mL SPT2-expressing membrane fraction using an assay buffer (100 mM Hepes (pH 8.0) containing 2.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and 0.01% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin), and the mixture was left standing at room temperature for 60 minutes. Subsequently, 5 µL of a substrate solution containing 2 mM L-serine and 20 µM palmitoyl CoA was added thereto, and an enzyme reaction was carried out in a 384-well plate using 20 µL in total of the reaction system. After reaction at room temperature for 15 minutes, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 µL of a 2% aqueous formic acid solution. Subsequently, 40 µL of acetonitrile containing 600 nM C17-sphinganine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL, US) was added thereto as an internal standard. The reaction sample was subjected to on-line solid-layer extraction using RapidFire 300 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA, US). The SRM transition of 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (reaction product) and C17-sphinganine (internal standard) was set to 300.5/270.3 and 288.4/60.2, respectively, on a positive SRM mode using API-4000 (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, US) equipped with ESI probes. Mass chromatograms were obtained using Analyst software (version 1.5.0, AB SCIEX). Their mass chromatogram areas were respectively calculated, and the rate of inhibition (%) by the test compound was calculated using an area ratio (the value of the reaction product was divided by the value of the internal standard).
The test results are shown in Table 3.

Test Example 3 Antitumor test using PL-21 cell
The compound of the present invention was evaluated for its antitumor effect on human leukemia cell line PL-21 cancer-bearing mice by the following method.
The human leukemia cell line PL-21 (JCRB) was transplanted to each 6-week-old Icr-scid female mouse (CLEA Japan Inc.) by the subcutaneous injection of 3.0 × 106 cells. The tumor size of successfully engrafted tumor was measured 13 days after the transplantation. The tumor volume was calculated according to the following expression:<img> id-imgb0702.tif </img>Tumor volume=Major axis×Minor axis×Minor axis×1/2
Individuals in which the volume of the engrafted tumor reached 100 to 150 mm3 were selected and used in the experiment as groups each involving 5 or 6 individuals. A 0.5% methylcellulose suspension of each test compound was orally administered to each mouse using the dose (indicated by single dose), the number of doses and the dosing period shown in Table 5. The tumor sizes at the day before the start of the administration and one day after the completion of the administration were measured and the tumor volume was calculated.
The rate of tumor growth (T/C (%)) in the test compound administration group compared with a control administration group was calculated according to the following expression:<img> id-imgb0703.tif </img>T/C%=Tumor volume after the completion of the administration of the test compound administration group−Tumor volume before the start of the administration of the test compound administration group/Tumor volume after the completion of the administration of the control administration group−Tumor volume before the start of the administration of the control administration group×100
The test results are shown in Table 5.

Test Example 4 Efficacy evaluation test using Niemann-Pick disease model cell
A normal line and an acidic sphingomyelinase-deficient cell line (Niemann-Pick disease model cells), which is responsible for Niemann-Pick disease, are each cultured using Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At the day following the inoculation to the culture plate, the medium is replaced, and the cells are cultured in a medium containing each SPT inhibitor for 4 days. After the culture, the medium is discarded, and sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin in the cells are extracted with hexane and quantified by use of TLC, gas chromatography or the like.
Test Example 5 Efficacy evaluation test using Niemann-Pick disease model mouse
The Niemann-Pick disease-ameliorating effect of each SPT inhibitor is confirmed using Niemann-Pick disease model mice (e.g., acidic sphingomyelinase-deficient mice (FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1988) or NPC mice confirmed to have sphingomyelin accumulation (Nat Med. 2008; 14: 1247)). These model mice manifest symptoms similar to those of human Niemann-Pick disease associated with sphingomyelin accumulation, etc., in the liver, the lung or the like. Furthermore, these mice manifest liver damage and nerve dysfunction and die at the age of approximately 12 weeks without treatment.
Four-week-old Niemann-Pick disease model mice are used. The test is started at the age of 4 weeks, and a 0.5% methyl cellulose suspension of each test compound is orally administered to the mice for 2 or 4 weeks. After the continuous administration, organ samples are collected. The effect of lowering liver damage markers serum AST (aspartate aminotransferase) and ALT (alanine aminotransferase) is tested as an evaluation parameter for the ameliorating effect of the SPT inhibitor. In addition, its ameliorating effect in each tissue image of the liver, central nerve and the like is also tested. In order to confirm SPT inhibitory activity, the effect of lowering sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin in tissues is further tested.
Industrial Applicability
The compound of the present invention can be used as a SPT inhibitor and can be useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for SPT-related diseases including cancer and the like.
The present application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2015-086195 filed in Japan, the contents of which are incorporated herein by their entirety.
