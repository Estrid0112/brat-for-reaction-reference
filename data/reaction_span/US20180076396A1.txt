BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to a condensed cyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that, compared to devices in the art, have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, and short response times, as well as excellent brightness, driving voltage, and response speed characteristics.
An example of such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially stacked from the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transition from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.

As represented by Formula 1A-2' below, since the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 includes a first electron donor moiety, a second electron donor moiety, and an electron acceptor moiety, electrons easily move in the molecule. Accordingly, an organic light-emitting device including the condensed cyclic compound may have high luminescent efficiency. Also, since a dipole is formed from the electron donor moiety to the electron acceptor moiety in the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1, a dipole moment in the molecule increases. Accordingly, the organic light-emitting device including the condensed cyclic compound may have high luminescent efficiency.
<img> id-US20180076396A1-20180315-C00091.TIF </img>
Also, the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 is a compound that may emit a delayed fluorescence, and triplet-state excitons as well as singlet-state excitons may be used for light emission. Accordingly, the organic light-emitting device including the condensed cyclic compound may have high luminescent efficiency.
Therefore, an electronic device (e.g., an organic light-emitting device) including the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may have a low driving voltage, high efficiency, and high external quantum efficiency.
A synthesis method for the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art by referring to the following examples.
At least one condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be used between a pair of electrodes constituting an organic light-emitting device. For example, the condensed cyclic compound may be included in at least one layer selected from a hole transport region and an emission layer. In one or more embodiments, the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 may be used as a material for forming a capping layer positioned outside the pair of electrodes of the organic light-emitting device.
Accordingly, provided is an organic light-emitting device including: a first electrode; a second electrode facing the first electrode; and an organic layer between the first electrode and the second electrode, the organic layer including an emission layer, wherein the organic layer includes at least one condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1.
The expression “(an organic layer) includes at least one condensed cyclic compound” used herein may include a case in which “(an organic layer) includes identical compounds represented by Formula 1” and a case in which “(an organic layer) includes two or more different condensed cyclic compounds represented by Formula 1.”
For example, the organic layer may include, as the condensed cyclic compound, only Compound 1. In this regard, Compound 1 may exist in an emission layer of the organic light-emitting device. In one or more embodiments, the organic layer may include, as the condensed cyclic compound, Compound 1 and Compound 2. In this regard, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may exist in an identical layer (for example, Compound 1 and Compound 2 may exist in an emission layer) or different layers (for example, Compound 1 may exist in an emission layer and Compound 2 may exist in a hole transport layer).
According to one or more embodiments,
the first electrode of the organic light-emitting device may be an anode,
the second electrode of the organic light-emitting device may be a cathode,
the organic layer of the organic light-emitting device may further include a hole transport region between the first electrode and the emission layer and an electron transport region between the emission layer and the second electrode,
the hole transport region may include a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an emission auxiliary layer, an electron blocking layer, or any combination thereof,

In one or more embodiments, the condensed cyclic compound included in the emission layer may be a delayed fluorescence dopant, and the delayed fluorescence dopant may satisfy Equation 1.
<in-line-formulae>|ED,S1−ED,T1|≦0.3 eV.  <Equation 1></in-line-formulae>
In Equation 1,
ED, S1 refers to singlet energy (eV) of the delayed fluorescence dopant.
ED, T1 refers to triplet energy of the delayed fluorescence dopant.
Since the difference between the singlet energy (ED, S1) and the triplet energy (ED, T1) of the delayed fluorescence dopant, that is, the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1, is 0.3 eV or less, a singlet exciton and a triplet exciton, which are generated by an electric field, may easily transition into an intermediate state.
Accordingly, an organic light-emitting device manufactured by using the condensed cyclic compound may have high luminescent efficiency.
In one or more embodiments, the condensed cyclic compound included in the emission layer may be a delayed fluorescence dopant, the emission layer may further include a host, and the delayed fluorescence dopant and the host may satisfy Equation 2 or 3:
<in-line-formulae>EH,HOMO−ED,HOMO|≦0.5 eV  <Equation 2></in-line-formulae>
<in-line-formulae>|EH,LUMO−ED,LUMO|≦0.5 eV  <Equation 3></in-line-formulae>
wherein, in Equations 2 and 3,
EH, HOMO refers to a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the host,
ED, HOMO refers to a HOMO level of the dopant,
EH, LUMO refers to a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the host, and
ED, LUMO refers to a LUMO level of the dopant.
Since the difference between the HOMO level of the delayed fluorescence dopant, that is, the condensed cyclic compound represented by Formula 1 and the HOMO level of the host, or the difference between the LUMO level of the delayed fluorescence dopant and the LUMO level of the host, is 0.5 eV or less, charges may easily move from the host to the delayed fluorescence dopant, and accordingly, an organic light-emitting device including the condensed cyclic compound and the host may have excellent luminescent efficiency.
For example, the host may include a silicon-based compound, a carbazole-based compound, or a phosphine oxide-based compound.
In one or more embodiments, the host may include one selected from Compounds H101 to H106:

The organic light-emitting device may further include at least one selected from a first capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward the outside of the organic light-emitting device through the first electrode and a second capping layer disposed in a pathway along which light generated in an emission layer proceeds toward the outside of the organic light-emitting device through the second electrode, and the at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include at least one of the condensed cyclic compounds.
For example, the organic light-emitting device may have i) a stack structure including a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer, which are sequentially stacked in this stated order; ii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, and a second electrode, which are sequentially stacked in this stated order; or iii) a stack structure including a first capping layer, a first electrode, an organic layer, a second electrode, and a second capping layer, which are sequentially stacked in this stated order, and at least one selected from the first capping layer and the second capping layer may include the condensed cyclic compound.
The term “organic layer” used herein refers to a single layer and/or a plurality of layers disposed between the first electrode and the second electrode of the organic light-emitting device. A material included in the “organic layer” is not limited to an organic material.

EXAMPLE
Example 1
An anode was prepared by cutting an ITO glass substrate (manufactured by Corning), on which an ITO layer was deposited to a thickness of a size of 15 Ω/cm2 (1,200 Å), to a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm; ultrasonically cleaning the ITO glass substrate by using isopropyl alcohol and pure water each for 5 minutes; and then exposing the ITO glass substrate to UV irradiation and ozone for 30 minutes to clean the ITO glass substrate. Then, the ITO glass substrate was loaded into a vacuum deposition apparatus.
NPB was vacuum-deposited on the ITO glass substrate (anode) to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 40 Å, and mCP was vacuum-deposited on the hole injection layer to form a hole transport layer having a thickness of 10 Å.
Compound H101 (host) and Compound 1 (dopant) were co-deposited on the hole transport layer at a weight ratio of 85:15 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 200 Å.
ET1 was vacuum-deposited on the emission layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, and Al was vacuum-deposited on the electron transport layer to form a second electrode (cathode) having a thickness of 3,000 Å, thereby completing the manufacture of an organic light-emitting device.
