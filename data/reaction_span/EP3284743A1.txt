Chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation are two ways commonly used in the treatment of cancers. The two therapies both cause DNA single strand and/or double strand break, and thus exert a cytotoxic effect, resulting in the death of target tumor cells due to chromosome damage. In response to DNA damage, an important consequence is the activation of cell cycle checkpoint signaling for the purpose of protecting the cells against mitosis in case of DNA damage, thereby avoiding cell damage. In most cases, the tumor cells have a high proliferation rate while exhibiting deficiency in cell cycle checkpoint signaling. Therefore, it can be inferred that a specific mechanism of DNA repair exists in the tumor cells, which may rapidly respond to and repair the chromosome damage associated with proliferation regulation, such that the tumor cells survive the cytotoxic effect of some therapeutic agent.
In clinical use, the concentration of the chemotherapeutic agent or the intensity of the radiation is effective for counteracting the mechanism of DNA repair, to ensure the killing effect on target tumor cells. However, resistance to treatment may be developed in the tumor cells through a strengthened mechanism of DNA damage repair, such that the tumor cells survive the fatal DNA damage. To overcome the resistance development, the dose of the therapeutic agent or the intensity of the radiation is generally required to be enhanced. This has a detrimental effect on normal tissues around the lesion, whereby serious adverse effects are implicated during treatment, and the treatment risk is increased. Meanwhile, the therapeutic effect is decreased with increasing resistance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the cytotoxic effect of a DNA damaging agent may be improved in a tumor cell-specific manner by regulating the DNA damage signaling and repair mechanism.
Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerases (PARPs) characterized by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity constitute a super family of 18 intranuclear and cytoplasmic enzymes. Through this poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, the catalytic activity of target proteins and the protein-protein interactions may be modulated, and some fundamental biological processes are regulated, including DNA repair, and cell death. Moreover, the genomic stability also correlates with the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation.
PARP-1 activity accounts for about 80% of the total PARP activity in the cells. PARP-1 and PARP-2 closest thereto are members in the PARP family that have an ability to repair the DNA damage. As a sensor and signaling protein of DNA damage, PARP-1 can quickly detect and directly bind to the site of DNA damage, followed by inducing the aggregation of numerous proteins required for DNA repair, such that the DNA damage is repaired. When PARP-1 is deficient in the cells, PARP-2 is able to repair the DNA damage in place of PARP-1. Studies show that compared with normal cells, PARPs are expressed at a generally increased level in solid tumors. Furthermore, cancers (e.g. breast and ovary cancer) which are deficient in DNA repair-related genes (e.g. BRCA-1 or BRCA-2) are extremely sensitive to the PARP-1 inhibitor, indicating that the PARP inhibitor, as a single therapeutic agent, is potentially useful in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer. Moreover, since the mechanism of DNA damage repair is a principal mechanism through which resistance is developed in the tumor cells counteracting the chemotherapeutic agent and ionizing radiation. Accordingly, PARP-1 is considered to be a target of interest in seeking a new method for treating cancers.
The PARP inhibitors that are developed and designed previously are analogues developed with nicotinamide of NAD that is a substrate for PARP as a template. These inhibitors are competitive inhibitors of NAD, which compete with NAD for the catalytic sites of PARP, thereby hindering the synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) chain. Without the modification with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARP cannot be cleaved from the site of DNA damage, such that other proteins involved in repair cannot access the site of damage and thus the repair process cannot be performed. Therefore, under attack of cytotoxic agents or radiation, the presence of the PARP inhibitor ultimately leads to the death of tumor cells with impaired DNA.
In addition, NAD, consumed as a substrate for PARP, is essential to the synthesis of ATP in cells. At a high level of PARP activity, the intracellular NAD level decreases dramatically, thus affecting the ATP level in cells. Due to the inadequate content of ATP in the cells, the cells are failed in ATP-dependent programmed cell death, and have to turn to necrosis, a special apoptosis process. During necrosis, a large amount of inflammatory factors are released, causing a toxic effect to other organs and tissues. Therefore, the PARP inhibitor may find use in the treatment of many diseases associated with such a mechanism, including neurodegenerative diseases (for example, senile dementia, Huntington's disease, and Parkinson's disease), diabetes, ischemia or complications during ischemic reperfusion, for example, myocardial infarction and acute renal failure, diseases of circulatory system, for example, septic shock, and inflammatory diseases such as chronic rheumatism.
Among a total of 14 PARP inhibitors in clinical research, AZD2281 (with a structural formula below) developed by AstraZeneca was approved by FDA in December 2014 for treating end-stage ovarian cancer patients with indications sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. Relevant patent applications includeWO2002036576 andWO2006021801.<img> id-imgb0001.tif </img>
Although a series of PARP inhibitors have been disclosed at present, there is still a need to develop a new compound with better efficacy, better pharmacokinetic properties, and lower toxicity. After unremitting efforts, the present invention relates to a compound of general Formula (I) and the compound having such a structure is found to exhibit excellent effects and actions.

Biological evaluation
Example 1: PARP enzyme activity assay
Experimental principle:
Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins is a post-translational modification occurred in response to DNA damage. PARP is the abbreviation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which catalyzes the attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) to an adjacent nuclear protein in the presence of NAD, thus eliciting a mechanism of DNA repair through base excision repair pathway. The level of biotin-labeled ADP-ribose binding to histone can be detected by using the HT Universal Chemiluminescent PARP Assay Kit commercially available from Trevigen Corp.
Reagents and materials
1. HT Universal Chemiluminescent PARP Assay Kit with Histone-coated Strip Wells, commercially available from Trevigen (US), Catalog #: 4676-096-K.2. Plate reader: EnVision Multilabel Plate Reader available from Perkin Elmer (US).

The positive and negative control wells contained the IX PARP buffer (containing 5% DMSO). AZD2281 (Olaparib, AstraZeneca PLC) was used as the control compound.
Experimental procedures
1. 50 µl of IX PARP buffer per well was added to infiltrate the histone, and the plate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then the IX PARP buffer in each well was aspirated, and the remaining liquid was tapped dry on paper towels.2. The diluted 5X solutions of Compounds (1) to (21) and the control compound AZD2281 were added to respective wells (10 µl per well). The positive and negative control wells contained the IX PARP buffer (containing 5% DMSO).3. The PARP enzyme was diluted in the IX PARP buffer to give a concentration of 0.5 Unit per 15 µl, and then 15 µl of the enzyme solution was added to each well except that the negative control well was added exclusively with the IX PARP buffer. The plate was incubated for 10 min at room temperature.4. 25 µl of the IX PARP Cocktail was sequentially added to each well.5. The plate was incubated for 60 min at 27°C.6. After incubation, the reaction solution was aspirated from the wells, and the remaining liquid was tapped dry on paper towels. Then, the plate was washed 4 times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (200 µl per well per wash), and the remaining liquid was tapped dry on paper towels.7. Subsequently, the diluted IX Strep-HRP solution was added to each well, and then the plate was incubated for 60 min at 27°C.8. After incubation, the reaction solution was aspirated from the wells, and the remaining liquid was tapped dry on paper towels. Then, the plate was washed 4 times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (200 µl per well per wash), and the remaining liquid was tapped dry on paper towels.9. After washing, equal volume of the PeroxyGlow A and B solutions were uniformly mixed, 100 µl of the solution was added to each well, and the chemiluminescent signals were recorded on a plate reader immediately.

The stock solution of Compounds (1) to (21) and the control compound AZD2281 was serially diluted in DMSO to give solutions at various concentration gradients, including 20 µM, 2 µM, 0.2 µM, 0.02 µM, 0.002 µM, and 0.0002 µM. Before experiment, the formulated solution at various concentration gradients of each test compound was aseptically 100-fold diluted in the complete cell culture medium. The concentration gradients of the positive compound included 200 nM, 20 nM, 2 nM, 0.2 nM, 0.02 nM, and 0.002 nM. These were 2x compound solutions, and could be used to treat the cells.
Experimental procedures
1. One day before treatment with the compounds, the cells were inoculated into a 96-well plate at a density of 8000 cells/50 µl/well.2. On the following day, the formulated 2x compound solutions were added, in accordance with a compound arrangement pattern, to the plate in an amount of 50 µl/well.3. The plate was gently agitaged, and incubated for 120 hrs in an incubator at 37°C.4. After incubation, the formulated reagent was added to the plate following instruction of the CellTiter Glo reagent, fully mixed, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.5. The plate was analyzed on a plate reader, the chemiluminescence was read, and the data was recorded.
Data processing
The reading of each well needs to be converted into cell viability. The cell viability can be calculated using the following formula:<img> id-imgb0040.tif </img>Cell viability %=Reading of sample wellReading of solvent control well×100%
The processed data was subjected to non-linear regression analysis by using the GraphPad Prism5 analysis software, to obtain a dose-response curve; and the median effective dose (ED50) of test compounds for the MDA-MB-436 cells was calculated.
