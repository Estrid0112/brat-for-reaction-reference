In one embodiment, the efficacy of treatment is monitored by measuring the levels of 2HG in the subject. Typically levels of 2HG are measured prior to treatment, wherein an elevated level is indicated for the use of Compound 1 to treat the cancer selected from glioma, melanoma, chondrosarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma (e.g., glioma), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), and lymphoma (e.g., T-cell lymphoma). Once the elevated levels are established, the level of 2HG is determined during the course of and/or following termination of treatment to establish efficacy. In certain embodiments, the level of 2HG is only determined during the course of and/or following termination of treatment. A reduction of 2HG levels during the course of treatment and following treatment is indicative of efficacy. Similarly, a determination that 2HG levels are not elevated during the course of or following treatment is also indicative of efficacy. Typically, the these 2HG measurements will be utilized together with other well-known determinations of efficacy of cancer treatment, such as reduction in number and size of tumors and/or other cancer-associated lesions, improvement in the general health of the subject, and alterations in other biomarkers that are associated with cancer treatment efficacy.
2HG can be detected in a sample by the methods of PCT Publication No. WO 2013/102431 and US Publication No. US 2013/0190287 hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, or by analogous methods.

8. Combination Therapy
In certain embodiments, the tablet compositions provided herein are used with an additional cancer therapeutic agent or an additional cancer treatment. Exemplary additional cancer therapeutic agents and additional cancer treatments are described in US 2013/0190287, US 2017/0157132, WO 2017/066611, WO 2017/066599 and U.S. application Ser. No. 15/368,405, the disclosures of each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.
In certain embodiments, additional cancer therapeutic agents include for example, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, antibody therapies, immunotherapy, and hormonal therapy. In certain embodiments, additional cancer treatments include, for example: surgery, and radiation therapy. Examples of each of these treatments are provided below.
In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a chemotherapy agent. Examples of chemotherapeutic agents used in cancer therapy include, for example, antimetabolites (e.g., folic acid, purine, and pyrimidine derivatives), alkylating agents (e.g., nitrogen mustards, nitrosoureas, platinum, alkyl sulfonates, hydrazines, triazenes, aziridines, spindle poison, cytotoxic agents, topoisomerase inhibitors and others), and hypomethylating agents (e.g., decitabine (5-aza-deoxycytidine), zebularine, isothiocyanates, azacitidine (5-azacytidine), 5-flouro-2'-deoxycytidine, 5,6-dihydro-5-azacytidine and others). Exemplary agents include Aclarubicin, Actinomycin, Alitretinoin, Altretamine, Aminopterin, Aminolevulinic acid, Amrubicin, Amsacrine, Anagrelide, Arsenic trioxide, Asparaginase, Atrasentan, Belotecan, Bexarotene, bendamustine, Bleomycin, Bortezomib, Busulfan, Camptothecin, Capecitabine, Carboplatin, Carboquone, Carmofur, Carmustine, Celecoxib, Chlorambucil, Chlormethine, Cisplatin, Cladribine, Clofarabine, Crisantaspase, Cyclophosphamide, Cytarabine, Dacarbazine, Dactinomycin, Daunorubicin, Decitabine, Demecolcine, Docetaxel, Doxorubicin, Efaproxiral, Elesclomol, Elsamitrucin, Enocitabine, Epirubicin, Estramustine, Etoglucid, Etoposide, Floxuridine, Fludarabine, Fluorouracil (5FU), Fotemustine, Gemcitabine, Gliadel implants, Hydroxycarbamide, Hydroxyurea, Idarubicin, Ifosfamide, Irinotecan, Irofulven, Ixabepilone, Larotaxel, Leucovorin, Liposomal doxorubicin, Liposomal daunorubicin, Lonidamine, Lomustine, Lucanthone, Mannosulfan, Masoprocol, Melphalan, Mercaptopurine, Mesna, Methotrexate, Methyl aminolevulinate, Mitobronitol, Mitoguazone, Mitotane, Mitomycin, Mitoxantrone, Nedaplatin, Nimustine, Oblimersen, Omacetaxine, Ortataxel, Oxaliplatin, Paclitaxel, Pegaspargase, Pemetrexed, Pentostatin, Pirarubicin, Pixantrone, Plicamycin, Porfimer sodium, Prednimustine, Procarbazine, Raltitrexed, Ranimustine, Rubitecan, Sapacitabine, Semustine, Sitimagene ceradenovec, Strataplatin, Streptozocin, Talaporfin, Tegafur uracil, Temoporfin, Temozolomide, Teniposide, Tesetaxel, Testolactone, Tetranitrate, Thiotepa, Tiazofurine, Tioguanine, Tipifamib, Topotecan, Trabectedin, Triaziquone, Triethylenemelamine, Triplatin, Tretinoin, Treosulfan, Trofosfamide, Uramustine, Valrubicin, Verteporfin, Vinblastine, Vincristine, Vindesine, Vinflunine, Vinorelbine, Vorinostat, Zorubicin, and other cytostatic or cytotoxic agents described herein.
Because some drugs work better together than alone, two or more drugs are often given at the same time. Often, two or more chemotherapy agents are used as combination chemotherapy.
In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a differentiation agent. Such differentiation agent includes retinoids (such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), 9-cis retinoic acid, 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cRA) and 4-hydroxy-phenretinamide (4-HPR)); arsenic trioxide; histone deacetylase inhibitors HDACs (such as azacytidine (Vidaza) and butyrates (e.g., sodium phenylbutyrate)); hybrid polar compounds (such as hexamethylene bisacetamide ((HMBA)); vitamin D; and cytokines (such as colony-stimulating factors including G-CSF and GM-CSF, and interferons).
In some embodiments the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a targeted therapy agent. Targeted therapy constitutes the use of agents specific for the deregulated proteins of cancer cells. Small molecule targeted therapy drugs are generally inhibitors of enzymatic domains on mutated, overexpressed, or otherwise critical proteins within the cancer cell. Prominent examples are the tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cediranib, dasatinib, erlotinib, imatinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, Lestaurtinib, Nilotinib, Semaxanib, Sorafenib, Sunitinib, and Vandetanib, and also cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors such as Alvocidib and Seliciclib. Monoclonal antibody therapy is another strategy in which the therapeutic agent is an antibody which specifically binds to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells. Examples include the anti HER2/neu antibody trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN®) typically used in breast cancer, and the anti CD20 antibody rituximab and Tositumomab typically used in a variety of B cell malignancies. Other exemplary antibodies include Cetuximab, Panitumumab, Trastuzumab, Alemtuzumab, Bevacizumab, Edrecolomab, and Gemtuzumab. Exemplary fusion proteins include Aflibercept and Denileukin diftitox. In some embodiments, the targeted therapy can be used in combination with a compound described herein, e.g., a biguanide such as metformin or phenformin, preferably phenformin.
Targeted therapy can also involve small peptides as “homing devices” which can bind to cell surface receptors or affected extracellular matrix surrounding the tumor. Radionuclides which are attached to these peptides (e.g., RGDs) eventually kill the cancer cell if the nuclide decays in the vicinity of the cell. An example of such therapy includes BEXXAR®.
In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is an immunotherapy agent. Cancer immunotherapy refers to a diverse set of therapeutic strategies designed to induce the subject's own immune system to fight the tumor. Contemporary methods for generating an immune response against tumors include intravesicular BCG immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer, and use of interferons and other cytokines to induce an immune response in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma subjects.
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can be considered a form of immunotherapy, since the donor's immune cells will often attack the tumor in a graft versus tumor effect. In some embodiments, the immunotherapy agents can be used in combination with a compound or composition described herein.
In some embodiments, the additional cancer therapeutic agent is a hormonal therapy agent. The growth of some cancers can be inhibited by providing or blocking certain hormones. Common examples of hormone sensitive tumors include certain types of breast and prostate cancers. Removing or blocking estrogen or testosterone is often an important additional treatment. In certain cancers, administration of hormone agonists, such as progestogens may be therapeutically beneficial. In some embodiments, the hormonal therapy agents can be used in combination with a compound or a composition described herein.
Other possible additional therapeutic modalities include imatinib, gene therapy, peptide and dendritic cell vaccines, synthetic chlorotoxins, and radiolabeled drugs and antibodies.
In one embodiment, the compositions provided herein are used for treatment of AML in combination with an AML induction and consolidation therapy. In one embodiment, the AML induction therapy is a combination of cytarabine and daunorubicin. In one embodiment, the AML induction therapy is a combination of cytarabine and idarubicin.

The resulting slurry was heated to reflux (75-80° C.) for 16-20 h. The reaction was cooled to 30-40° C. and THF was evaporated at below 45° C. under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture was cooled to 20-35° C., rinsed with ethyl acetate and water, and the ethyl acetate layer was collected. The organic layer was concentrated under vacuum at below 45° C. then rinsed with dichloromethane and hexanes, filtered and washed with hexanes and dried for 8-10 h at 45-50° C. under vacuum to provide 2-methyl-1-(4-(6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl)-6-(2-(trifluoromethyl)-pyridin-4-ylamino)-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino)propan-2-ol.
Example 2: Synthesis of 2-methyl-1-[(4-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]-6-{[2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl]amino}-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-ol methanesulfonate
Acetone (435.0 mL) and 2-methyl-1-[(4-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]-6-{[2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl]amino}-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-ol (87.0 g, 0.184 mol) were added to the reaction vessel at 20-35° C. In a separate vessel, methanesulfonic acid was added over 10 minutes to cold (0-4° C.) acetone (191.4 mL) while stirring to prepare a methane sulfonic acid solution. While passing through a micron filter, the freshly prepared methanesulfonic acid solution was added dropwise to the reaction mixture. The resulting slurry was filtered using nutsche filter and washed with acetone. The filtered material was dried for 30-40 minutes using vacuum to provide 2-methyl-1-[(4-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]-6-{[2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl]amino}-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-ol methanesulfonate.

The tablet formulations described below were prepared and tested to:evaluate and compare different types of compression tooling with respect to their shape, material of construction and surface coating/treatment;evaluate process parameters during granulation (roller compaction and milling) and compression;evaluate formulation composition with respect to lubricant and glidant concentrations used intra- vs. extra-granularly; andevaluate effect of coating on tablet dissolution profiles.
The tablet formulations are divided into three groups as described below. FIG. 5 illustrates a process development plan for feasibility of 25 mg and 150 mg strength tablets in the three groups.
Group 1
In Group 1 (Formulations 0101 to 0103), the formulations were evaluated for compression of 25 mg tablets with tooling of various coatings or treatments on an instrumented 10 station Piccola single layer tablet press. The following tooling were compared:
Chromium Nitride Ultra Coat from Natoli-coated by an electrolytic process;
Chromium Nitride-IBED coated by Beamalloy Technologies, LLC-coated by ion beam enhanced deposition method;
M340 steel-High Chromium content steel; and
Standard, 6 mm round, plain faces.
The press was equipped with 2 sets of each tooling type for a maximum of six compression stations, depending on tooling used. Runs with standard, 6 mm round punches (FD-304) were set up with only two stations. A set-up run was performed to achieve target tablet weight and hardness following which the run was continued with intermittent evaluation of punch surfaces for any kind of film formation. Process parameters evaluated were:
1. Pre-compression Evaluation: Initial press “set-up” activities were performed utilizing pre-compression with clean tooling. The run was continued with intermittent evaluation of punch surfaces.
2. Elevated Main Compression: Press “set-up” was performed utilizing pre-compression (if applicable); however, for the first five revolutions of compression set the main compression force approaching the maximum force tip rating (NMT 10% of the maximum force specified on the tooling drawings) was used. Tablets were intentionally compressed above specification with respect to tablet hardness to evaluate the impact of compression force on the film formation. After five revolutions, the main compression force was reduced to achieve target tablet hardness. The run was continued with intermittent evaluation of punch surfaces.
3. Elevated Main Compression w/o Pre-compression: Experiment similar to the process above was repeated but without using any pre-compression force.
As listed in Table 2 (Batch Nos. 25 mg 0101 to 25 mg 0301) different formulation batches were produced to determine the effect of minor adjustments to the intra-granular and extra-granular composition of magnesium stearate and/or colloidal silicon dioxide.
Group 2
In Group 2, formulations 0104-0106 were evaluated with the following tooling:Standard 6 mm round, plain tooling (25 mg strength);0.624″×0.3268″ capsule-shaped plain (150 mg strength); and0.624″×0.3268″ IBED-treated (150 mg strength).
Pre-compression force was increased in formulation 4 and 5 up to 75% to determine effect on punch filming and sticking.
In Group 2, formulations were roller compacted with a change in excipient composition. In the extra-granular composition, MCC PH102 was decreased, while magnesium stearate amount was increased to increase lubrication. A comparison of compaction force was also tested in formulation 4 with two screen sizes (0.8 and 1.25 mm) to determine the effect on particle size distribution.
Group 3
In Group 3 (Formulations 0107 to 0110), formulations with higher extra-granular MCC PH102 were compared, with reduced drug load or intra-granular MCC PH102. The 150 mg strength tablets were compressed using the following tooling:0.624″×0.3268″ capsule-shaped, bead blasted punches by Natoli;0.643″×0.337″ capsule-shaped, plain by Elizabeth Carbide (also abbreviated EC);0.643″×0.337″ capsule-shaped, plain by EC; and0.643″×0.337″ capsule-shaped, bead blasted punches by EC
Formulation 0110 was processed by increasing main compression forces, and samples were collected to determine effect on tablet dissolution.
Table 2 summarizes compositions for the coated tablets for formulations 0101-0110 (designated as 0101-0110). Table 3 provides summary of tooling and process parameters studied during various trials and the respective observations.

Complete manufacturing process is summarized below.
2-Methyl-1-[(4-[6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-yl]-6-{[2-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-4-yl]amino}-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)amino]propan-2-ol methanesulfonate was bag mixed with a portion of microcrystalline cellulose and screened through #20 mesh screen and transferred to V-shell. Other intra-granular excipients were manually screened through #20 mesh screen, except magnesium stearate which was screened through #30 mesh screen and transferred to the V-shell. This mixture was blended at 25 RPM for 12 min 30 sec. Magnesium stearate previously screened through 30#mesh screen was added to the above mixture and blending was continued for 3 more minutes at 25 RPM.
This blend was compacted (dry granulated) using Gerteis MiniPactor using smooth rollers and milled using 0.8 mm granulator screen.
The milled granules were transferred to an appropriate size V-shell for final blending. Extra-granular excipients were weight adjusted for the granulation yield and added to the milled granules. The final blending was performed for 12 min 30 seconds at 25 RPM. The extra-granular portion of magnesium stearate was added to the final blend and the lubrication blending was performed for 3 min at 25 RPM.
The final lubricated blends were then compressed using the Piccola tablet press.
The core tablets were evaluated for appearance, weight variation, hardness, thickness, disintegration, and friability.
The coating was performed on core tablets from selected batches in the Lab coat I in a 12″ coating pan using an aqueous suspension of Opadry II containing 18% w/w solid content.
The pre-blend and final blend granule samples were collected for physical testing (appearance, particle size, bulk and tap density, flow properties). The ribbon samples were collected for ribbon density measurement. Samples of the tablets were collected for analytical testing.

As seen from data in Tables 13-15, increasing main run compression force lowered the tablet dissolution rate only in early time points (from 0 to 30 minutes) but remained unchanged past 30 minutes.
Example 6: Effect of Coating on the Dissolution Profile
The coated tablets were subjected to dissolution testing. The effect of coating on the dissolution profile is provided in Table 16 below:

As seen from data in Table 16, coating appears to have affected the dissolution profile mainly at early time points (5 min and 10 min) where the percent drug dissolved was noted to be slightly less as compared to that of uncoated tablets from the same batch. However, overall dissolution profile between 15 min-60 min remained unaffected and more than 90% drug was dissolved within 30 min.
Example 7: Drug Substance Form Change Studies
The drug substance lots were stored in representative commercial bulk packaging at room temperature for up to 18 months. No form change was detected for the drug substance lots.
The tablet formulations in Table 17 were used in a study to determine drug substance form change in the formulations:
