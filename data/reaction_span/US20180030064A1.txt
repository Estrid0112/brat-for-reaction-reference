FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The invention relates to 1-aminomethylisochroman compounds, and pharmaceutical compositions containing them, for the treatment of central nervous system diseases and disorders. Such diseases and disorders include depression, bipolar disorder, pain, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, psychostimulation, addiction, social disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, an anxiety disorder, autism, a cognitive impairment, or a neuropsychiatric symptom such as apathy, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, psychosis, aggression, agitation, impulse control, and sleep disruption in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
All publications, patents, patent applications, and other references cited in this application are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes and to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent, patent application or other reference was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Citation of a reference herein shall not be construed as an admission that such is prior art to the present invention.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Central nervous system diseases and disorders affect a wide range of the population with differing severity. Neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders include major depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among others. These diseases and disorders affect a person's thoughts, mood, behavior and social interactions and can significantly impair daily functioning. See, e.g., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Ed., American Psychiatric Association (2000) (“DSM-IV-TR”); Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Ed., American Psychiatric Association (2013) (“DSM-5”). Furthermore, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as apathy, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, psychosis, aggression, agitation, impulse control and sleep disruption are now recognized as core impairments of neurological diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
While medications exist for some aspects of these diseases, there remains a need for effective treatments for various neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders. For example, while mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate, antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs are used to treat mood disorders, more effective medications are necessary. And current antipsychotics may be successful in treating the positive symptoms of schizophrenia but fare less well for the negative and cognitive symptoms. Additionally, current antidepressants are typically effective only for a proportion of subjects suffering from depression. Furthermore, despite the fact that the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of neurological disease such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are major reasons for the institutionalization of subjects, few drugs exist to treat them.

Compounds and Compositions and Definitions:
Compounds and compositions of this invention include those described generally above, and are further illustrated by the classes, subclasses, and species disclosed herein. As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise indicated. A comprehensive list of abbreviations utilized by organic chemists (i.e. persons of ordinary skill in the art) appears in the first issue of each volume of the Journal of Organic Chemistry. The definitions therein, which are typically presented in a table entitled “Standard List of Abbreviations” are the definitions used herein.
The graphic representations of racemic, ambiscalemic and scalemic or enantiomerically pure compounds used herein are a modified version of the denotations taken from Maehr J. Chem. Ed. 62, 114-120 (1985): simple lines provide no information about stereochemistry and convey only connectivity; solid and broken wedges are used to denote the absolute configuration of a chiral element; solid and broken bold lines are geometric descriptors indicating the relative configuration shown but not necessarily denoting racemic character; and wedge outlines and dotted or broken lines denote enantiomerically pure compounds of the indicated relative stereochemistry of indeterminate absolute configuration. For example, the graphic representation:
<img> id-US20180030064A1-20180201-C00025.TIF </img>
indicates a trans relationship between the two chiral centers, that is, either or both of the two representations below:
<img> id-US20180030064A1-20180201-C00026.TIF </img>
in any ratio, from pure enantiomers to racemates, while the representation:
<img> id-US20180030064A1-20180201-C00027.TIF </img>
indicates a single enantiomer with the absolute configuration depicted, e.g., ((R)-1-((R)-5-fluoroisochroman-1-yl)ethan-1-amine in the illustration above. In the text describing the stereochemistry of the examples, the convention of Chemical Abstracts is used. Thus “(R)-1-((R)-5-rel- . . . ” indicates that the two chiral centers are in that relative relationship, which would be depicted in a structural diagram by solid bold and dashed lines, whereas “(R)-1-((R)-5-. . . ” without the “rel” indicates a single enantiomer of that absolute configuration, which would be depicted in a structural diagram by solid and broken wedges.
The “enantiomeric excess” or “% enantiomeric excess” of a composition can be calculated using the equation shown below. In the example shown below, a composition contains 90% of one enantiomer, e.g., the S enantiomer, and 10% of the other enantiomer, e.g., the R enantiomer. ee=(90−10)/100=80%.
Thus, a composition containing 90% of one enantiomer and 10% of the other enantiomer is said to have an enantiomeric excess of 80%. Some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the S enantiomer. In other words, the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the S enantiomer over the R enantiomer. In other embodiments, some compositions described herein contain an enantiomeric excess of at least about 50%, 75%, 90%, 95%, or 99% of the R enantiomer. In other words, the compositions contain an enantiomeric excess of the R enantiomer over the S enantiomer.
For instance, an isomer/enantiomer can, in some embodiments, be provided substantially free of the corresponding enantiomer, and can also be referred to as “optically enriched,” “enantiomerically enriched,” “enantiomerically pure” and “non-racemic,” as used interchangeably herein. These terms refer to compositions in which the percent by weight of one enantiomer is greater than the amount of that one enantiomer in a control mixture of the racemic composition (e.g., greater than 1:1 by weight). For example, an enantiomerically enriched preparation of the S enantiomer, means a preparation of the compound having greater than about 50% by weight of the S enantiomer relative to the R enantiomer, such as at least about 75% by weight, further such as at least about 80% by weight. In some embodiments, the enrichment can be much greater than about 80% by weight, providing a “substantially enantiomerically enriched,” “substantially enantiomerically pure” or a “substantially non-racemic” preparation, which refers to preparations of compositions which have at least about 85% by weight of one enantiomer relative to other enantiomer, such as at least about 90% by weight, and further such as at least 95% by weight. In certain embodiments, the compound provided herein is made up of at least about 90% by weight of one enantiomer. In other embodiments, the compound is made up of at least about 95%, 98%, or 99% by weight of one enantiomer.
In some embodiments, the compound is a racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-isomers. In other embodiments, provided herein is a mixture of compounds wherein individual compounds of the mixture exist predominately in an (S)- or (R)-isomeric configuration. For example, the compound mixture has an (S)-enantiomeric excess of greater than about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, about 99.5%, or more. In other embodiments, the compound mixture has an (S)-enantiomeric excess of greater than about 55% to about 99.5%, greater than about 60% to about 99.5%, greater than about 65% to about 99.5%, greater than about 70% to about 99.5%, greater than about 75% to about 99.5%, greater than about 80% to about 99.5%, greater than about 85% to about 99.5%, greater than about 90% to about 99.5%, greater than about 95% to about 99.5%, greater than about 96% to about 99.5%, greater than about 97% to about 99.5%, greater than about 98% to greater than about 99.5%, greater than about 99% to about 99.5%, or more.
In other embodiments, the compound mixture has an (R)-enantiomeric purity of greater than about 55%, about 60%, about 65%, about 70%, about 75%, about 80%, about 85%, about 90%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%, about 99.5% or more. In some other embodiments, the compound mixture has an (R)-enantiomeric excess of greater than about 55% to about 99.5%, greater than about 60% to about 99.5%, greater than about 65% to about 99.5%, greater than about 70% to about 99.5%, greater than about 75% to about 99.5%, greater than about 80% to about 99.5%, greater than about 85% to about 99.5%, greater than about 90% to about 99.5%, greater than about 95% to about 99.5%, greater than about 96% to about 99.5%, greater than about 97% to about 99.5%, greater than about 98% to greater than about 99.5%, greater than about 99% to about 99.5% or more.
In other embodiments, the compound mixture contains identical chemical entities except for their stereochemical orientations, namely (S)- or (R)-isomers. For example, if a compound disclosed herein has -CH(R)- unit, and R is not hydrogen, then the -CH(R)- is in an (S)- or (R)-stereochemical orientation for each of the identical chemical entities. In some embodiments, the mixture of identical chemical entities is a racemic mixture of (S)- and (R)-isomers.

As used herein, and as would be understood by the person of skill in the art, the recitation of “a compound”-unless expressly further limited-is intended to include salts of that compound. Thus, for example, the recitation “a compound of formula I” as depicted above, which contains a basic amine residue -NR3R4, would include salts -NHR3R4+X− wherein X− is any counterion. In a particular embodiment, the term “compound of formula I” refers to the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; this term refers to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound, even if not explicitly stated. Unless otherwise stated or depicted, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all stereoisomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and cis-trans isomeric) forms of the structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z) and (E) double bond isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and cis-trans isomeric (or conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. In addition to therapeutic uses, such compounds are useful, for example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays.
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M. Berge et al., describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 1977, 66, 1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Although pharmaceutically acceptable counter ions will be preferred for preparing pharmaceutical formulations, other anions are quite acceptable as synthetic intermediates. Thus X may be pharmaceutically undesirable anions, such as iodide, oxalate, trifluoromethanesulfonate and the like, when such salts are chemical intermediates.
Unless otherwise specified, the word “includes” (or any variation thereon, e.g., “include”, “including”, etc.) is intended to be open-ended. For example, “A includes 1, 2 and 3” means that A includes but is not limited to 1, 2 and 3.
Unless otherwise specified, the phrase “such as” is intended to be open-ended. For example, “A can be a halogen, such as chlorine or bromine” means that A can be, but is not limited to, chlorine or bromine.
According to another embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a compound of this invention (or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt) and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle. In some embodiments, the amount of compound in compositions of this invention is such that is effective to treat, prevent, and/or manage various neurological and/or psychiatric diseases, disorders and/or symptoms in a subject.

Compositions of the present invention may be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, sublingually, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term “parenteral” as used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial, intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques. Preferably, the compositions are administered orally, intraperitoneally or intravenously. Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension. These suspensions may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions.
The amount of compounds of the present invention that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a composition in a single dosage form will vary depending upon a variety of factors, including the host treated and the particular mode of administration. It should also be understood that a specific dosage and treatment regimen for any particular subject will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and the judgment of the treating physician and the severity of the particular disease being treated. The amount of a compound of the present invention in the composition will also depend upon the particular compound in the composition.
As used herein, the terms “treatment,” “treat,” and “treating” refer to reversing, alleviating, delaying the onset of, or inhibiting the progress of a disease or disorder, or one or more symptoms thereof, as described herein. In some embodiments, treatment may be administered after one or more symptoms have developed. In other embodiments, treatment may be administered in the absence of symptoms. For example, treatment may be administered to a susceptible individual prior to the onset of symptoms (e.g., in light of a history of symptoms and/or in light of genetic or other susceptibility factors). Treatment may also be continued after symptoms have resolved, for example to prevent or delay their recurrence.
In some embodiments, the invention provides a method for treating a neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder in a subject, comprising administering to the subject an effective amount of a compound of this invention (or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt), or composition comprising a compound of this invention (or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt). Neurological and/or psychiatric diseases and disorders can exhibit a variety of psychiatric and behavioral symptoms, including apathy, depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, psychosis, aggression, agitation, poor impulse control and sleep disruptions.
In one embodiment, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's Disease with agitation, Alzheimer's Disease with aggression or Alzheimer's Disease with agitation aggression.
In one embodiment, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression, dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, Alzheimer's Disease with agitation, Alzheimer's Disease with aggression or Alzheimer's Disease with agitation aggression, a neurocognitive disorder, a neurocognitive disorder with behavioral and psychological symptoms.
In one embodiment, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder are behavioral and psychological symptoms of a neurocognitive disorder including dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The behavioral and psychological symptoms include disturbances in perception, thought content, mood, or behaviors including delusions (distressing beliefs), hallucinations, agitation (easily upset, repeating questions, arguing or complaining, hoarding, pacing, inappropriate screaming, crying out, disruptive sounds, rejection of care leaving home), aggression (physical or verbal), depression or dysphoria, anxiety (worrying, shadowing), apathy or indifference, disinhibition (socially inappropriate behavior, sexually inappropriate behavior, irritability or lability, motor disturbance (repetitive activities without purpose, wandering, rummaging, night-time behaviors (waking and getting up at night) impulsivity, attentional deficits, executive dysfunction.
Assays were used herein to identify representative candidate treatments. Examples of candidate treatments include, without limitation, treatment of Alzheimer's Disease with agitation, Alzheimer's Disease with aggression and Alzheimer's Disease with agitation aggression. Aggression and agitation are common symptoms in neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders. Aggression and agitation have been associated with hyperactivity in subcortical brain regions, which can be modelled in animals using psychostimulants (eg PCP, Amphetamine). For example, psychostimulants induce hyperlocomotor activity (HLA) in animals. Antipsychotics (eg. haloperidol, clozapine and risperidone) have been shown to reduce psychostimulant-induced HLA and are efficacious against agitation in Alzheimer's disease. Other drugs used off-label, or are currently under study in clinical trials, for agitation in Alzheimer's disease are mood stabilizers, such as lithium (which also decreases Amphetamine-induced HLA), and antidepressants (eg. citalopram). Antidepressants demonstrate activity in assays such as the forced swim and tail suspension tests. Therefore, the aforementioned assays were helpful in identifying candidate treatments for agitation in Alzheimer's disease and agitation/aggression in other neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders.

In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, cognitive impairment, stroke, schizophrenia, Down syndrome, or Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is Alzheimer's disease. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is Parkinson's disease. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is depression. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is cognitive impairment. In some embodiments, the cognitive impairment is cognitive dysfunction associated with depression, for example, major depressive disorder. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is stroke. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is schizophrenia. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is Down syndrome. In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disorder is Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.
In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorders (including both bipolar I and bipolar II) are serious psychiatric disorders that have a prevalence of approximately 2% of the population, and affects both genders alike. It is a relapsing-remitting condition characterized by cycling between elevated (i.e., manic) and depressed moods, which distinguishes it from other disorders such as major depressive disorder and schizophrenia. Bipolar I is defined by the occurrence of a full manic episode, although most individuals experience significant depression. Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, hyperactivity, grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts and in some cases, psychosis. The depressive episodes are characterized by anhedonia, sad mood, hopelessness, poor self-esteem, diminished concentration and lethargy. Bipolar II is defined as the occurrence of a major depressive episode and hypomanic (less severe mania) episode although subjects spend considerable more time in the depressive state. Other related conditions include cyclothymic disorder.
In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a disorder of unknown origin, which usually appears for the first time in early adulthood and is marked by characteristics such as psychotic symptoms, phasic progression and development, and/or deterioration in social behavior and professional capability. Characteristic psychotic symptoms are disorders of thought content (e.g., multiple, fragmentary, incoherent, implausible or simply delusional contents, or ideas of persecution) and of mentality (e.g., loss of association, flight of imagination, incoherence up to incomprehensibility), as well as disorders of perceptibility (e.g., hallucinations), emotions (e.g., superficial or inadequate emotions), self-perceptions, intentions, impulses, and/or inter-human relationships, and psychomotoric disorders (e.g., catatonia). Other symptoms are also associated with this disorder. Schizophrenia is classified into subgroups: the paranoid type, characterized by delusions and hallucinations and absence of thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and affective flattening; the disorganized type, also named “hebephrenic schizophrenia,” in which thought disorder and flat affect are present together; the catatonic type, in which prominent psychomotor disturbances are evident, and symptoms may include catatonic stupor and waxy flexibility; and the undifferentiated type, in which psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met. The symptoms of schizophrenia normally manifest themselves in three broad categories: positive, negative and cognitive symptoms. Positive symptoms are those which represent an “excess” of normal experiences, such as hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms are those where the subject suffers from a lack of normal experiences, such as anhedonia and lack of social interaction. The cognitive symptoms relate to cognitive impairment in schizophrenics, such as lack of sustained attention and deficits in decision making.
In some embodiments, the neurological or psychiatric disease or disorder is anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are characterized by fear, worry, and uneasiness, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a situation. Anxiety disorders differ in the situations or types of objects that induce fear, anxiety, or avoidance behavior, and the associated cognitive ideation. Anxiety differs from fear in that anxiety is an emotional response to a perceived future threat while fear is associated with a perceived or real immediate threat.

Accordingly, the present invention provides a single unit dosage form comprising a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, an additional therapeutic agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
The amount of both, an inventive compound and additional therapeutic agent (in those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent as described above) that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. Preferably, compositions of this invention should be formulated so that a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of an inventive can be administered.
In those compositions which comprise an additional therapeutic agent, that additional therapeutic agent and the compound of this invention may act synergistically. Therefore, the amount of additional therapeutic agent in such compositions will be less than that required in a monotherapy utilizing only that therapeutic agent. In such compositions a dosage of between 0.01-100 mg/kg body weight/day of the additional therapeutic agent can be administered.
The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that agent as the only therapeutically active agent.
In some embodiments, the present invention provides a medicament comprising at least one compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle.
In some embodiments, the present invention provides the use of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a neurological and/or psychiatric disease or disorder.

In another embodiment, a suitable 2-(2-bromophenyl)oxirane (7-1) is reacted with n-BuLi and tert-butyl methyl(2-oxoethyl)carbamate, followed by treatment with HCl to form intermediate 7-2. Treatment of 7-2 with TMS trifluoromethanesulphonate yields 1-(4-chloroisochroman-1-yl)-N-methylmethanamine (7-3, or I where R9=Cl). Treatment of Boc-protected 7-3 with silver nitrate followed by zinc powder in acetic acid converts the chloride to the corresponding hydroxide. Removal of the protecting Boc-group affords compound I. The stereoisomers of I are separated using HPLC/chiral HPLC to provide single enantiomers (I)

In another embodiment, a suitable N-unsubstituted compound I (8-1) can be alkylated to give compounds of formula I by direct alkylation with an alkyl halide via its Boc-protected intermediate or by reductive amination using a ketone or an aldehyde.

In another embodiment, a suitable aryl bromide (9-1) is reacted with n-BuLi and a suitable N-protected aminoacetaldehyde 9-2 to form intermediate 9-3. Coupling of 9-3 with a suitable vinyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane such as 3,3,4,4-tetramethyl-1-vinylborolane provides 9-4. Hydroboration-oxidation of 9-4 yields 9-5. Mesylation, cyclization, then BOC-deprotection affords compound I. Alternatively, bromination of 9-4 yields 9-6, which is cyclized and depretected to yield I. The stereoisomers of I are separated using HPLC/chiral HPLC to provide single enantiomers (I).

In another embodiment, a suitable 1-hydroxyalkyl 2-bromo-substituted benzene (10-1) is reacted with a suitable 2,2-dialkoxy-ethanamine or N-protected 2,2-dialkoxy-ethanamine (10-2) in the presence of an acid or a Lewis acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid or trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate to render the cyclized product (10-3) (Scheme 10). Protection of 10-3 followed by Pd-catalyzed borylation then treatment with sodium perborate affords compound I, which may be separated using chiral HPLC to provide single enantiomers of formula (I). In some cases, 2-3 is first N-protected with a BOC group followed by hydrodehalogenation and deprotection to provide compound I, which may be separated using chiral HPLC to provide single enantiomers of formula (I).

Biological Assays
Neuropharmacological Assay (SmartCube™)
In order to demonstrate the utility of the provided compounds to treat neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders, exemplary compounds were evaluated using the neuropharmacological screen described in S. L. Roberds et al., Front. Neurosci. 2011 Sep. 9; 5:103 (doi: 10.3389/fnins.2011.00103) (“Roberds”). As reported in Roberds, because psychiatric diseases generally result from disorders of cell-cell communication, circuitry, intact systems are useful in detecting improvement in disease-relevant endpoints. These endpoints are typically behavioral in nature, often requiring human observation and interpretation. To facilitate testing of multiple compounds for behavioral effects relevant to psychiatric disease, PsychoGenics, Inc. (Tarrytown, N.Y., “PGI”) developed SmartCube™, an automated system in which behaviors of compound-treated mice are captured by digital video and analyzed with computer algorithms. (D. Brunner et al., Drug Discov. Today 2002, 7:S107-S112). PGI Analytical Systems uses data from SmartCube™ to compare the behavioral signature of a test compound to a database of behavioral signatures obtained using a large set of diverse reference compounds. (The composition of the database as well as validation of the method is further described in Roberds). In this way, the neuropharmacological effects of a test compound can be predicted by similarity to major classes of compounds, such as antipsychotics, anxiolytics and antidepressants.
The SmartCube™ system produces an activity signature indicating the probability that the activity of the test compound at the administered dose matches a given class of neuropharmacological agents. (See, e.g., Roberds, FIGS. 2 and 3). The test compound is simultaneously compared against multiple classes of agents; thus, a separate probability is generated for each behavioral effect measured (e.g., anxiolytic activity, analgesic activity, etc.). In the table below, these probabilities are reported for each behavioral effect measured as follows:
<table>
<header>
 & 
</header>
 & LOQ≦ & + & <5%
 & 5%≦ & ++ & <25%
 & 25%≦ & +++ & <50%
 & 50%≦ & ++++
 & 
</table>
where LOQ is the limit of quantification.
Provided compounds were dissolved in a mixture of Pharmasolve™ (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone), polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol, and were injected i.p. 15 min. before the behavioral test. For each compound, injections were administered at 3 different doses. For each behavioral effect measured, results for the most efficacious dose(s) are presented. In the table below, DP: anti-depressant; AX: anxiolytic; SD: sedative hypnotic; PS: anti-psychotic; MS: mood stabilizer; AD: ADHD; CE: cognitive enhancer; AG: analgesic; UN: uncharacterized CNS activity.
The potency of many of the compounds in the table was also determined in the SmartCube™ system. Test compounds were routinely examined at dose levels of 0.3, 1, 3 10 and 30 mg per kg (mpk), although the dose range was increased or decreased if necessary to obtain a full dose response curve. A compound's minimal effective dose (MED) is a measure of the compounds potency. The MED was defined as the dose (in mpk) having 50% or more total activity in SmartCube. The potencies of the compounds are shown in the table below, with potency values in mpk binned in the following manner:
<table>

Additional Rodent Tests
Forced Swim Test Procedures
The Forced Swim test (FST) is an indicator of the antidepressant-like activity of a test compound. Male Balb/cJ mice (26-31 g) were given a 30 minute pretreatment with vehicle (sterile water), sertraline control or test compound. The FST consists of one 6 minute session of forced swimming in individual opaque cylinders containing water at a temperature of 23±2° C. The mouse will swim before “giving up” and becoming immobile, the time spent immobile was recorded over the 6 minute trial. A compound with antidepressant-like activity will decrease the time the mouse is immobile over the 6 minute trial. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. Data is shown in FIGS. 1a and 1b.
Phencyclidine (PCP)-Induced Hyperlocomotion
The PCP-induced hyperlocomotion assay is an indicator of antipsychotic-like activity. Male C57Bl/6J mice (20-26 g) were administered vehicle or test compound and placed in holding cages for 30 minutes, after which they were placed in the locomotor activity chambers for 30 minutes of baseline capture. The test chambers are Plexiglas rectangular chambers (24×45 cm) that fit inside two steel frames (9.5×18 inches) and are fitted with two-dimensional 4×8 beam grids to monitor horizontal and vertical locomotor activity. Total distance traveled was measured from horizontal beam breaks as the animal traveled. Following the 30 minute baseline period, all rats were injected with saline or PCP (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) and returned to the locomotor activity chambers for a 60 minute test session. A compound with antipsychotic-like activity will decrease the distance traveled following administration of PCP. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. Data is shown in FIGS. 2a and 2b.
Amphetamine-Induced Hyperlocomotion Assay
Amphetamine (AMPH) is frequently used to induce or mimic a manic-like state. The antimanic-like effects of test compounds were evaluated in male C57Bl/6J mice. Mice were acclimatized to the experimental room for at least 1 hour prior to testing. The mice (n=10 per group) were administered vehicle or test compound and placed in the open field (OF) chambers for 30 minutes of baseline activity measurement. The mice were then injected with either water or AMPH (4 mg/kg, ip) and placed back in the OF chambers for a 60-minute testing session during which, the effects of test compounds on stimulant-induced hyperactivity behaviors (total distance traveled, rearing and stereotypy) were measured. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc comparisons with Fisher Tests when appropriate. Data is shown in FIGS. 3a to 3d.
Tail Suspension Test
The tail suspension test (TST) is a rodent screening test for potential (human) antidepressant drugs. It is based on the assumption that an animal will actively try to escape an aversive (stressful) stimulus. If escape is impossible, the animal will eventually stop trying (“give up”). In the TST, a mouse is suspended by the tail so that its body dangles in the air, head downward. Mice initially struggle to face upward and climb to a solid surface. When the animal stops struggling and hangs immobile it is considered to have “given up”. Shorter periods of immobility are characteristic of antidepressant-like activity. Accordingly, longer periods of immobility are considered indicative of a depressive-like state. It has been shown that treatment with an antidepressant drug will decrease the time the animal spends immobile. See generally L. Stem et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl). 1985; 85(3):367-70; B. Thierry et al., Psychopharmacology 1986; 90:284-85.
Procedure. Adult male AJ mice from Jackson Laboratories received vehicle (sterile water) or test compound orally by gavage, or the positive control desipramine (20 mg/kg, i.p.), in 10 mL/kg injection volumes, 30 min before being subjected to the Tail Suspension Test. In this test, mice are placed in the Tail Suspension chambers (white polyvinylchloride cubicles measuring 33×33×31.75 cm Med Associates, Inc. St. Albans, Vt.) by a piece of transparent (Scotch®) tape attached to the tail, from about the mid-tail, with approximately 2 cm of tape past the end of the tail for 10 min during which the time spent immobile is measured. A reduction in total time immobile relative to the vehicle condition indicates an antidepressant drug-like response. Data is shown in FIGS. 4a to 4c.
