Those monomers are sometimes referred to as “Monomer (X)” in which (X) represents the sign of the formula corresponding to the monomer. For example, the monomer represented by formula (a1-1-3) is referred to as “Monomer (a1-1-3)”.
Resin Synthesis Example 1
The monomers (a1-1-3), (a1-2-9), (a2-1-1) and (a3-4-2) were mixed in a molar ratio of 35/15/2.5/47.5 (monomer (a1-1-3)/monomer (a1-2-9)/monomer (a2-1-1)/monomer (a3-4-2)), and propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate was added in 1.5 times parts based on total parts of all monomers to prepare a mixture. To the mixture, azobisisobutyronitrile as an initiator in a ratio of 1 mol % based on all monomer molar amount and azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) as an initiator in a ratio of 3 mol % based on all monomer molar amount were added, and the obtained mixture was heated at 73° C. for about 5 hours. The reaction mixture obtained was poured into a large amount of a mixture of methanol and water to cause precipitation, followed by being filtrated. The collected precipitate was dissolved in propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate, and then a large amount of the mixture of methanol and water was added thereto to cause precipitation, followed by being filtrated: This reprecipitation step was conducted twice. As a result, a polymer having a weight-average molecular weight of about 8,000 was obtained in a yield of 69%. The polymer had the following structural units. That resin is referred to as polymer A1.

<Evaluation>
Silicon wafers were each coated with “ARC-29”, which is an organic anti-reflective coating composition available from Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd., and then baked at 205° C. for 60 seconds, to form a 78 nm-thick organic anti-reflective coating. Each of the photoresist compositions prepared as above was spin-coated over the anti-reflective coating so that the thickness of the resulting film became 85 nm after drying. The silicon wafers thus coated with the respective photoresist compositions were each prebaked on a direct hotplate at the temperature as listed in the column “PB” of Table 6 for 60 seconds. Using an ArF excimer stepper (XT:1900G1 manufactured by ASML INC., 3/4 Annular, X-Y polarization) and a mask for forming contact hole pattern (pitch: 90 nm, diameter: 55 nm), each wafer having the respective resist film was subjected to exposure, with the exposure quantity being varied stepwise.
After the exposure, each wafer was subjected to post-exposure baking on a hotplate at the temperature as listed in the column “PEB” of Table 6 for 60 seconds and then to development for 20 seconds at 23° C. with butyl acetate (Tokyo Chemical Industries, Co., Ltd.) in the manner of dynamic dispense method to produce a negative photoresist pattern.
In the following evaluation, effective sensitivity (ES) means the exposure quantity with which exposure using the above-mentioned mask provides a pattern with 45 nm of the diameter after development.
<Evaluation of Mask Error Factor [MEF]>
Negative photoresist patterns were produced in the same manner as recited in “Producing photoresist patterns”, conducting exposure with an effective sensitivity and using a mask the hole diameter of which was 57 nm, 56 nm, 55 nm, 54 nm or 53 nm and the hole pitches of which was 90 nm.
The results were plotted along the abscissa axis representing diameters of mask holes and along the ordinate axis representing diameters of the holes of the photoresist patterns formed (transferred) on the substrate by exposure.
The slope of a plotted regression line, i.e., the increment of the ordinate per the increment by 1 of the abscissa, was determined as the MEF value.
The results are shown in Table 7. The numerical values in parentheses represent MEF values.
