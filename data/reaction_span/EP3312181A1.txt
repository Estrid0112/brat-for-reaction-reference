Technical Field
The present invention relates to an imidazodiazepine compound which has a positive allosteric modulating action (hereinafter, referred to as PAM action) on a dopamine D1 receptor, and which is expected as an active ingredient of pharmaceutical compositions, particularly, pharmaceutical compositions for preventing and/or treating cognitive impairment, schizophrenia negative symptom, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS), Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), drug dependency, or the like.
Background Art
Dopamine receptors belong among G-protein-coupled receptors that are expressed in the central nervous system. Dopamine receptors are classified into dopamine D1 receptor-like family and dopamine D2 receptor-like family. Among dopamine receptors, dopamine D1 and D5 receptors belong to the dopamine D1 receptor-like family, and dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors belong to the dopamine D2 receptor-like family.
It has been reported that the dopamine D1 receptor is coupled with Gs, which is a promoting G protein, to activate an adenylate cyclase, and enhances the production of cAMP in a cell to promote protein kinase A activity, and exhibit various functions (Medicinal Research Reviews, 2009, vol. 29(2), p. 272-294).
There is a report suggesting that the reduction of the dopamine D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex plays an important role in cognitive impairment and schizophrenia negative symptom. Because in patients with schizophrenia, dopamine D1 receptors were significantly reduced in a part of the frontal lobe, called a prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, because the degree of reduction of the dopamine D1 receptors was correlated with the results of Wisconsin Card Sorting Test which is a test for the intensity of schizophrenia negative symptom and the function of the frontal lobe(Nature, 1997, vol. 385(6617), p. 634-636).
Even in patients with depression, similarly to patients with schizophrenia, functional impairment in the prefrontal cortex has been reported (Psychiatry Research, 1999, vol. 89, p. 171-187).
It has been reported that, in a cognitive impairment model, a dopamine D1 receptor agonist is useful (European Neuropsychopharmacology, 2009, vol. 19(6), p. 440-450; Psychopharmacology, 2010, vol. 210(3), p. 407-418; Molecular Pharmacology, 2007, vol. 71(6), p. 1598-1609; and Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1996, vol. 777, p. 427-430).
It has been reported that a dopamine D1 receptor is related to schizophrenia negative symptom (The American Journal of Psychiatry, 2002, vol. 159(5), p. 761-767; and Pharmacopsychiatry, 2006, vol. 39(3), p. 115-116).
Therefore, the dopamine D1 receptor agonist is expected as a drug that stimulates the dopamine D1 receptor in the prefrontal cortex and can ameliorate cognitive impairment, schizophrenia negative symptom, CIAS, and depression.
There is a report suggesting that the dopamine D1 receptor agonist is expected to be applied to Parkinson's disease (Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs, 2001, vol. 2(11), p. 1582-1591) and Alzheimer's disease (The Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2011, vol. 286(5), p. 3270-3276).
Further, the dopamine D1 receptor agonist has been reported to exhibit the efficacy in each animal model of Huntington's disease (Neurodegenerative Diseases, 2011, vol. 8(4), p. 230-239) and drug dependency (Neuroscience Letters, 2012, vol. 513(2), p. 214-218).
Moreover, it has been suggested that a dopamine agonist is expected to be applied to cognitive impairment in ADHD (Neuropsychologia, 2013, vol. 51(2), p. 235-266; and Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine, 2014, vol. 7, p. 349-356).
Therefore, a compound stimulating the dopamine D1 receptor is expected to be promising as an agent for preventing and/or treating diseases such as cognitive impairment, schizophrenia negative symptom, CIAS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, ADHD, drug dependency, or the like.
The dopamine D1 receptor agonist is also used as an antihypertensive agent of peripherals (The New England Journal of Medicine, 2001, vol. 345(21), p. 1548-1557). Meanwhile, for example, it has been reported that dihydrexidine, which is a dopamine D1 receptor agonist that had been developed for Parkinson's disease, causes blood-pressure reduction as a side effect although exhibiting efficacy in Parkinson's disease (Clinical Neuropharmacology, 1998, vol. 21(6), p. 339-343).
Therefore, a compound that stimulates a dopamine D1 receptor but has no side effect, such as a blood-pressure reduction, is expected to be created.
A G-protein-coupled receptor has been long researched as an important target for drug discovery. In recent years, it has been revealed that many G-protein-coupled receptors also have allosteric sites different from orthosteric ligand sites (ACS Chemical Biology, 2008, vol. 3(9), p. 530-541). Here, research for drug discovery, in which allosteric sites in G-protein-coupled receptors are targets for drug discovery, has actively been made (British Journal of Pharmacology, 2012, vol. 165(6), p. 1659-1669).
A positive allosteric modulator (hereinafter, referred to as PAM) is a compound that binds to a site different from a binding site of an endogenous ligand to enhance a receptor function. PAM does not enhance a receptor function in itself, but enhances the receptor function in the presence of a ligand.
Therefore, it is expected that a dopamine D1 receptor PAM (hereinafter, referred to as D1 PAM) has a PAM action on a dopamine D1 receptor, can be used for preventing and/or treating cognitive impairment, schizophrenia negative symptom, CIAS, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, depression, ADHD, drug dependency, or the like, and is useful as a drug with less side effects compared to a dopamine D1 receptor agonist.

The compound of the formula (I) can be prepared from a compound (1) and a compound (2).
In this reaction, the compound (1) and the compound (2) are used in equivalent amounts or either thereof in an excess amount, and the mixture thereof is generally stirred in a solvent inert to the reaction in the presence of a condensing agent for 0.1 hours to 5 days under cooling to heating, preferably at -20Â°C to 60Â°C.

Test Example 1
Evaluation of Positive allosteric modulating action (PAM action)
The PAM action of the compound of the present invention was evaluated by the ratio of a left shift of a dopamine dose response curve.
The left shift means that the dopamine dose response curve, in which the logarithm of dose is set to abscissa (X axis) and the response (in this test, cAMP concentration) is set to ordinate (Y axis), is parallely shifted in the negative direction of the X axis by the addition of PAM.
(Establishment of human dopamine D1 receptor stably-expressing cell)
The coding sequence of a human dopamine D1 receptor (Accession No.: NM000794.3) was amplified by PCR, and was subcloned into a pEF-BOS vector. The obtained construct was transfected into a CHO (dhfr-) cell (ATCC No.: CRL-9096) using Lipofectamine 2000 (manufactured by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Lipofectamine is a registered trademark). The stably transfected clone was obtained by the selection using 100 nM MTX. The obtained cell clone was maintained in Î±MEM containing 10% FBS, penicillin and streptomycin.
(Test method)
(1) Dose-response curve of dopamine to which the compound of the present invention was added
The dose-response curve of dopamine to which a test drug was added was created by performing the following experiment.
The serially diluted solution of the test drug was prepared using the buffer solution for assay (concentration 0.49 ÂµM to 40 ÂµM, 3-fold dilution). The above serially diluted solution of the test drug was dispensed into a black 384 well plate (Corning Inc.) by 2.5 ÂµL.
Human dopamine D1 receptor stably-expressing CHO cells were seeded in each well at a density of about 5000 cells per well by 5 ÂµE, were spun down by a centrifuge for plate (05PR-22, Hitachi Koki Co., Ltd., 800 rpm), and were then left to stand for 10 minutes.
The serially diluted solution of dopamine was prepared by diluting a DMSO solution of dopamine (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC) with the buffer solution (concentration 0.018 ÂµM to 13.3 ÂµM, 3-fold dilution). The above serially diluted solution of dopamine was dispensed into each well of the plate by 2.5 ÂµL.
The plate was stirred using a plate shaker (mx-5, Sanko Junyaku Co., Ltd.), and was then left to stand for 15 minutes to 20 minutes at room temperature (final concentration: test drug 0 ÂµM to 10 ÂµM, dopamine 0 ÂµM to 3.3 ÂµM, 3-fold dilution).
To measure cAMP, LANCE Ultra cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Inc., LANCE is a registered trademark) was used. Kit reagent Eu-cAMP tracer solution and kit reagent ULight-anti-cAMP solution (ULight is a registered trademark) were respectively added to each well of the aforementioned plate in the amount of 5 ÂµL, and the reaction was stopped. The plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, and then the fluorescence intensity at 665 nm and 620 nm was measured (excitation wavelength: 320 nm, fluorescence wavelength: 665 nm, 620 nm) by TR-FRET method using a plate reader (2103 Multilabel Plate Reader (registered trademark Envision), PerkinElmer, Inc.). The fluorescence intensity ratio [(fluorescence intensity at 665 nm) / (fluorescence intensity at 620 nm) x 104] of each well was calculated, and was used for analysis.
As a control group, a well, to which dopamine is not added, was set to 0%, and a well, in which final concentration of dopamine is 3.3 ÂµM, was set to 100%.
(2) Dose-response curve for dopamine
The dose-response curve of dopamine was created by performing an experiment without a test drug in the same manner as in (1).
(Evaluation of activity)
From the results of the test, it was found that the dose-response curve (1) of dopamine to which the Example compound of the present invention was added was shifted leftward based on the dose-response curve (2) of dopamine. Further, it was found that each shift value was calculated by changing the concentration of the test drug, and thus the dose-response curve of dopamine was shifted leftward in a dose-dependent manner.
Here, in the case where the dose of dopamine was 0, the test drug did not exhibit an agonistic effect.
As described above, it was found that the compound of example of the present invention has a PAM action.
The results of the compounds of some representative Example compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 1.
The value of activity was expressed by a Shift value used as an index of activity.
The shift value is a value indicating to what extent the EC50 value of dopamine in 1.1 ÂµM the test drug increased on the basis of the EC50 value of dopamine without adding the test drug [Shift value = (EC50 value of dopamine without adding the test drug) / (EC50 value of dopamine in 1.1 ÂµM the test drug)]. Therefore, if the value of the test drug is greater than 1, it is indicated that the dose-response curve of dopamine was shifted leftward by the addition of the test drug. The EC50 value of dopamine was calculated using the dose-response curve of each dopamine.
In Table, No. represents compound number, Ex represents Example compound number, and Dat1 represents shift value.

</table>
Here, EC50 2-fold potentiation of Ex1 was 0.061 ÂµM. The EC50 2-fold potentiation means test drug concentration by which the EC50 in the dose-response curve (2) of dopamine is potentiated in 2-fold. For example, this is test drug concentration which enhance the EC50 in the dose-response curve (2) of dopamine from 1.0 ÂµM to 0.5 ÂµM (2 fold, in other words, half as numerical value).
Test Example 2
Y-maze test
The improvement effect on cognitive impairment of the compound of the present invention was evaluated using Y-maze test that is an experimental system of spontaneous alternation behavior.
(Experimental apparatus)
As the Y-maze, a maze in which three runways, each having a length of 40 cm, a height of 13 cm, a floor width of 3 cm, and an upper portion width of 10 cm, are attached to each other in a Y shape at an angle of 120Â°, was used.
(Test method)
The single oral administration of a test drug (0.01, 0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose) into a 5- to 6-week-old ddY male mouse (n = 8 Japan SLC, Inc.) was performed in 1 hour before the start of the Y-maze test, and the intraperitoneal administration of MK-801 (Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC), which is an NMDA receptor antagonist causing cognitive impairment, into the mouse in a dose of 0.15 mg/kg was performed in 20 minutes before the start of the Y-maze test.
Here, in the mouse of a control group, a vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) was used instead of the test drug. Moreover, a physiological saline instead of MK-801 was used.
In the mouse of a MK-801 control group, a vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) was used instead of the test drug.
After the aforementioned mouse was placed at the end of any runway in the Y-maze, the mouse was freely searched for eight minutes. The number of times the mouse has entered the runway was counted, and this counted number of times was set to the total entry number. The number of times the mouse has continuously entered three different runways (for example, when three arms were represented by a, b, and c, respectively, in the case where the order of entry of runways is abccbacab, it was counted by 4) was set to spontaneous alternation behavior number. Spontaneous alternation behavior rate is calculated by Calculation Equation: Spontaneous alternation behavior rate = [spontaneous alternation behavior number / (total entry number - 2)] x 100. The calculated spontaneous alternation behavior rate was set to an index of spontaneous alternation behavior. It is indicated that as this index value becomes higher, short-term memory is maintained.
(Data analysis)
The measured value was represented by average value Â± standard error for each group. The assay of significant difference between the control group and the MK-801 control group was carried out by the Student's t-test. Further, the assay of significant difference between the test drug administration group and the MK-801 control group was carried out by the Dunnett's type multiple comparison test to determine the learning disorder improvement effect of the test drug. With P < 0.05 in each assay, it was determined that the significant difference exists.
The results of significantly improving the spontaneous alternation behavior of the compounds of some representative examples of the present invention are shown in the table below. In the table, No. represents compound number, Ex represents Example compound number, and Dat2 represents minimum effective dose.

Test Example 3
Attentional set-shifting task
The compound of the present invention was evaluated by an attentional set-shifting task test.
The attentional set-shifting task test, as in WCST, is a test for measuring flexibility with respect to the change of a rule (clue). The effect on executive function disorder which is one of higher brain dysfunctions can be evaluated by this test.
After allowing the mouse to learn a task that food reward is obtained if there is a clue, in the case where the clue is shifted within a dimension (for example, the clue is changed from a form to another form), both normal animal and pathological animal having abnormality in the prefrontal cortex of the brain (hereinafter, referred to as "pathological animal") can discriminate clues to obtain food reward. However, after allowing the mouse to learn a task of obtaining food reward by a clue, in the case where the clue is shifted to the outside of a dimension (for example, the clue is changed from a form to aroma), the normal animal can discriminate a clue of food, but the pathological animal cannot discriminate the clue of food. This test puts this behavior to practical use.
The following experiments were carried out with reference to European Journal of Neuroscience, 2005, vol. 21, p. 1070-1076, which was partially modified.
(Test method)
1. Test apparatus and animal
As the test apparatus, a field including a start area and a choice area partitioned by a guillotine door was used. The choice area is partially partitioned such that left and right areas have the same size, as seen from the start area. Containers filled with contents were placed in the left and right areas one by one, and food reward (cereal pieces, General Mill Inc.) was buried therein. The left and right containers were replaced at random for each test (from start to correct answer or incorrect answer in the test). Rats placed in the start area were moved to the choice area when the guillotine door was opened, and were able to act freely between the left and right areas of the choice area.
As the pathological model, rats administered with sub-chronic PCP were used. 5-week-old male Long Evans rats (Japan SLC, Inc.) were prepared by intraperitoneally administering 2 mg/mL/kg of a PCP saline for 7 days twice a day. Tests were carried out after a washout period of 7 or 8 days. Food consumption was limited during the washout period.
2. Habituation
Rats were returned to the start area after starting the test by opening the guillotine door and allowing the rats to act freely for 4 minutes. Then, containers were placed in the left and right areas of the choice area one by one, respectively. Each of the containers was filled with alpha dry (Shepherd Specialty Papers, alpha dry is a registered trademark), one of the total of two food rewards was placed at the top of each of the containers, and the other one thereof was placed at the bottom of each of the containers. The rats were returned to a home cage after starting the test and confirming that the rats completely ate the food rewards (four food rewards).
3. Training
On the same day as the habituation, a simple discrimination (SD1) task was carried out as training. One container was filled with plastic beads, and the edge thereof was coated with nutmeg aroma oil. The other container was filled with wooden beads, and the edge thereof was coated with lemon aroma oil. The food reward was placed only in the former container, and the test was started. Rats returned to the start area (1) after completely eating the food reward as a correct answer or (2) immediately after digging the container as an incorrect answer. The rats were trained until they continuously provide correct answers five times.
4. Test
On the next day of the training, the rats were allowed to search the food reward by using contents or aroma as a clue. Six discrimination tasks, relating to a combination of contents and aroma, were conducted. It was allowed to proceed to the next tasks, when each discrimination task was correctly answered continuously five times. The test was carried out in order from the first item (SD2) to the sixth item (EDR). After the completion of CD, the single oral administration of a test drug (0.001, 0.003 and 0.01 mg/kg, suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose) into the rats was carried out. In the rats of the control group, a vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) was administered instead of the test drug.
Table 3 shows combinations of content and aroma in each task. Table 4 shows specific examples (an example). In Tables, underlines shows correct answers (clue of the container to which the food reward was placed).

5. Results
The number of examples is 6 examples in each group. The statistical analysis about the number of attempts to obtain continuous correct answers five times was carried out. The Student's t-test for the control group and the PCP control group was carried out. The significant difference (P <0.05) was observed only in the ED, and the executive function disorder in the PCP control group was detected. Further, the Dunnett's type multiple comparison test about the test drug administration group and the PCP control group was carried out to determine the effect of improving the executive function disorder of the test drug. The significant difference was not observed from the first item (SD2) to the fourth item (IDR) of the discrimination task, and in the sixth item (EDR) thereof, and the significant difference (P <0.05) was observed only in the fifth item (ED) of the discrimination task.
