FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to a Y-type discrete polyethylene glycol derivative and a preparation method thereof, in particular, the present invention relates to a discrete polyethylene glycol derivative having a branched structure with N as a branch node.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is considered to be the polymer with the lowest level of protein and cell absorption in known polymers, and it has advantages of good water solubility and biocompatibility, no toxicity, no immunity, no teratogenicity and no antigenicity, and is widely used in drug modification, agent preparation and medical materials and other fields. Since 1991, after the first PEG-modified drug PEG-ADA was approved by the FDA, the major pharmaceutical companies have put a great interest in research and development of PEG in the field of drug. In recent years, the products on the market include PEG-somatostatin, PEG-interferon, PEG-granulocyte colony stimulating factor, etc. At present, there are further dozens of PEG-modified drugs which are in the process of research or clinical trial.
Although PEG has a unique advantage in the field of drug modification, it has some shortcomings: 1) PEG is a polymer product, which is a mixture that has a defect of heterogeneity in itself, which may not only limit the use of PEG, e.g., when PEG is used to modify the superoxide dismutase, a series of heterogeneous products may be produced (Characterization of the heterogeneity of polyethylene glycol-modified superoxide dismutase by chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques, JSnider et. al., Journal of Chromatography A 1992, 599, 141-155); but also bring some difficulties for the consistency between different batches of products and the validation of final product in drug synthesis; 2) linear PEG molecules has a high molecular weight, but can only connect the drug at both ends, inevitably resulting in decreased drug loading capacity.
In order to overcome the adverse effects of PEG, Dhawan et al. (Synthesis of polyamide oligomers based on 14-amino-3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecanoic acid, Dhawan et. al., Bioconjugate Chemistry 2000, 11, 14-21) prepared a linear discrete polyethylene glycol having the same structure with PEG (i.e., PEG with a defined molecular weight) and a derivative thereof by the reaction of sodium alkoxide with sulphonate in an organic synthesis process. The discrete polyethylene glycol has the same chemical formula as PEG, but the two are not identical, e.g., PEG12 and EG12 (dodecaethylene glycol), the former being a mixture of EG11, EG12, EG13 and longer or shorter polyethylene glycol, and the latter being a definite compound containing only EG12.
Although linear discrete polyethylene glycol solves the problem that PEG itself is not heterogeneous, it itself brings new problems. It preparation method requires protecting one end of the discrete polyethylene glycol at first and performing Williamson synthesis under strictly anhydrous conditions and then deprotecting to obtain discrete ethylene glycol with a longer chain segment. The synthesis method involves many steps, complicated operation and harsh conditions, requires strictly anhydrous conditions to get sodium alkoxide, and needs to use hydrogen for reduction in deprotection, which may limit its further spread and wide use, and although the loading capacity of polyethylene glycol with a relatively short chain segment has been improved, the water solubility is also significantly reduced, which may make its application range greatly limited.
In order to solve the drawbacks of the prior art, the present invention provides a Y-type discrete polyethylene glycol derivative and a preparation method thereof.
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
It is an object of the present invention to provide a Y-type discrete polyethylene glycol compound, which can solve the problem of heterogeneity of existing polyethylene glycol products and at the same time increase the drug loading capacity.
It is another object of the present invention to solve the problem of insufficient water solubility of the polyethylene glycol-modified insoluble drug caused by an increase of the loading capacity.
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a preparation method of the discrete polyethylene glycol compound, which involves simple steps, mild conditions, without need for strictly anhydrous environment or performing protection and deprotection steps.
Thus one aspect of the present invention is to provide a Y-type discrete polyethylene glycol derivative having the structure of formula (I):

NH2-EG4-OH (4.3 g, 22.3 mmol) prepared in step 1 and THF (150 mL) were added to EG3-OMs (10.8 g, 44.6 mmol). The resulting mixture was refluxed and stirred overnight, and evaporated to remove the solvent to obtain a crude product, which was purified by a column (the mobile phase was MeOH/DCM system, MeOH/DCM=3-7%) to give the product in a yield of 2.1 g (19.4%). NMR(CDCl3) δ: 3.5-3.8 (m, 34H, OCH2), 3.37 (s, 6H, CH3O), 2.7-2.8 (m, 6H, N(CH2)3; ESI-MS: 486.4 (M+H)+, 508.4 (M+Na)+.
Example 7: synthesis of cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH
DCM (20 mL) and TEA (0.905 mL, 6.53 mmol) were added to the (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH (2 g, 5.45 mmol) prepared in Example 1. The cholesterol chloroformate (2.57 g, 5.72 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (30 mL), and the resulting mixture was added dropwise to the reaction flask. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Whether the reaction was complete was detected by TLC. The resulting mixture was washed once with water, and spin-dried to obtain a crude product, which was purified by a column (the mobile phase was MeOH/DCM system, MeOH/DCM=0-7%) to give 1.4 g product (32.4%).
NMR(CDCl3) δ: 5.55-5.45 (m, 1H), 4.65-4.50 (m, 1H), 4.1-4.0 (m, 2H), 3.5-3.8 (m, 20H), 3.37 (s, 6H), 2.7-2.8 (m, 6H), 2.50-0.80 (m, 42H), 0.65-0.60 (m, 3H).
Example 8: synthesis of cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH
A cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH was prepared under the same conditions as in Example 7 by commercially available mEG7-OH.
NMR(CDCl3) δ: 5.55-5.45 (m, 1H), 4.65-4.50 (m, 1H), 4.1-4.0 (m, 2H), 3.5-3.8 (m, 26H), 3.37 (s, 3H), 2.50-0.80 (m, 40H), 0.65-0.60 (m, 3H).
Example 9: Comparison Test of Dispersion of Cholesterol and Cholesterol Derivatives in Water
20 mg cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH prepared in Example 7, 20 mg cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH prepared in Example 8 and 20 mg cholesterol were placed in a 50 mL volumetric flask, which was added with water to the scale, and placed in 20° C. water bath, shaken vigorously every 5 min for 30 min. After 30 min, the dispersion of the two cholesterol derivatives and cholesterol in water were shown in FIG. 7, from the left to the right are successively cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH, cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH and cholesterol. The results with the naked eye observation showed that the dispersion liquid of cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH was translucent light blue, and the handwriting behind the volumetric flask can be clearly seen; and the cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH was a white emulsion, and cholesterol is completely insoluble.
Example 10: Comparison Test of Solubility of Cholesterol Derivatives in Water
The solubility of cholesterol derivatives in water was determined according to the method in “Chinese pharmacopoeia”:
21.3 mg cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH prepared in Example 7 was dispersed in 50 mL water. 5 mL was taken out therefrom, and added with 1.5 mL water, the resulting mixture was placed in a 20° C. water bath, and shaken vigorously every 5 min for 30 min. After 30 min, 1.5 mL water was further added, and the resulting mixture was placed in a 20° C. water bath with the same procedure for dissolution. Until 9 mL water was added, the solution was clear.
24.2 mg cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH prepared in Example 8 was dispersed in 50 mL water. 5 mL was taken out therefrom, and added with 5 mL water, the resulting mixture was placed in a 20° C. water bath, and shaken vigorously every 5 min for 30 min. After 30 min, 5 mL water was further added, and the resulting mixture was placed in a 20° C. water bath with the same procedure for dissolution until 25 mL water was added. 5 mL solution was taken from the dilute solution, the same procedure was carried out until 10 mL water was added, and the solution was clear.
From the results analysis, it was found that the solubility of cholesterol derivative of (mEG3)2N-C3H6-OH was 15.2 mg/100 g, which was 3.3 times the solubility of cholesterol derivative of mEG7-OH, 4.61 mg/100 g, and was 76 times the solubility of cholesterol (<0.2 mg/100 g).
