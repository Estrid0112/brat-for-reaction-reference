BACKGROUND
The human tissue kallikrein (KLK) family of secreted serine proteases comprises fifteen homologously related enzymes (Kallikrein-Related Peptidases, V. Magdolen et al. (ed), De Gruyter, Berlin (2012) Vol. 1 and 2). Human tissue kallikrein (KLK1), the parent member of the family and known since 1930, is now joined by fourteen kallikrein-related peptidases (KLK2-KLK15). The KLKs play important roles in a wide range of physiological processes, such as tooth enamel formation, skin desquamation, seminal liquefaction, neural plasticity and brain function, and immune response. The regulation of KLKs is fine-tuned by specific mechanisms such as zymogen activation cascades (KLKs are originally produced in inactive forms) and endogenous KLK inhibitors. Mis-regulation of KLK levels/activities has been observed in numerous diseases, and the use of KLKs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, most notably KLK3 (PSA), has been extensively studied (Hernandez et al. Cancer, 2004, 101, 894; Schmitt et al. Thromb. Haemost. 2009, 101, 222). The investigation of KLKs as targets for pharmacological therapy is significantly more limited, but has been recently reviewed (Prassas et al. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015, 14, 183.)
KLK6 is most highly expressed in the central nervous system, and has been suggested as a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (Diamandis et al. Clin. Biochem. 2000, 33, 369; Yousef et al. Clin. Chim. Acta 2003, 329, 1; Shaw et al. Clin. Chem. 2007, 53, 1423; Blaber et al. Biochemistry, 2007, 46, 5209). In addition, a number of studies have shown a correlation between KLK6 levels and the proliferation (Kim et al. Cancer, 2011, 117, 2608), cell migration, and invasion of cancer cell lines (Krenzer et al. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2011, 131, 2281). There are only two reports of small molecule inhibitors of KLK6 (Liang et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 22, 2450; Liang et al. ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2012, 3, 159.) Both publications report the X-ray crystal structure of inhibitors bound to KLK6 and demonstrate that the inhibitors are bound via hydrogen bonding of a basic residue to the side chain of Asp189, which sits in the active site of the enzyme. The inhibitors show only moderate potency and no selectivity over related enzymes was reported. Thus, there is still a great need for new inhibitor scaffolds which can potently and selectively inhibit KLK6. The present invention satisfies this need by providing the KLK6-inhibiting compounds of the formula I.

Alkyl group substituents include, but are not limited to, any of the substituents described herein, that result in the formation of a stable moiety. A substituted alkyl group can be substituted in any positions, provided that the resulting compound is sufficiently stable and is suitable as a pharmaceutical active compound. The prerequisite that a specific group and a compound of any one of formulas I, II, III and IV is sufficiently stable and suitable as a pharmaceutical active compound, applies in general with respect to all groups in the compounds of any one of formulas I, II, III and IV. If an alkyl group can be monosubstituted or polysubstituted by fluorine, it can be unsubstituted, i.e. not carry fluorine atoms, or substituted, for example by 1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or 11 fluorine atoms, preferably by 1 , 2, 3, 4 or 5 fluorine atoms, which can be present in any positions. For example, in a fluoro-substituted alkyl group one or more methyl groups can carry three fluorine atoms each and be present as trifluoromethyl groups, and/or one or more methylene groups (CH2) can carry two fluorine atoms each and be present as difluoromethylene groups. The explanations with respect to the substitution of a group by fluorine also apply if the group additionally carries other substituents and/or is part of another group, for example of an alkyl-O-group. Examples of fluoro-substituted alkyl groups are trifluoromethyl, 2-fluoroethyl, 1 ,1-difluoroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, pentafluoroethyl, 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl, 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl, 4,4,4-trifluorobutyl and heptafluoroisopropyl. Examples of fluoro-substituted alkyl-O- groups are trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, pentafluoroethoxy and 3,3,3-trifluoropropoxy.

In some embodiments the alkyl group may be substituted by one or more identical or different substituents chosen from halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, (C1-C6)alkyl-O- and (C1-C6)alkyl-S(O)m-. Examples of (C1-C6)alkyl-O- are methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, isobutoxy, tert-butoxy and n-pentoxy.

In one embodiment of the invention the number m is chosen from 0 and 2, wherein all numbers m are independent of each other and can be identical or different. For example, if the alkyl group is substituted by a CF3-S- group, the CF3-S- group is bonded to this alkyl group via the sulfur as it is symbolized by the terminal line (hyphen) next to the sulfur atom representing a free bond. In some embodiments the alkyl chain is a linear. In some embodiments the alkyl chain is branched. In some embodiments the alkyl chain is substituted.

As used herein and throughout the entire description, the term "solvate" refers to an addition complex of a dissolved material in a solvent (such as an organic solvent (e.g., an aliphatic alcohol (such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol), acetone, acetonitrile, ether, and the like), water or a mixture of two or more of these liquids), wherein the addition complex exists in the form of a crystal or mixed crystal. The amount of solvent contained in the addition complex may be stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric. A "hydrate" is a solvate wherein the solvent is water.
As used herein and throughout the entire description, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a salt that retains the desired biological activity of the parent compound and does not impart any undesired toxicological effects (see e.g., Berge, S. M., et al. (1977) J. Pharm. Sci. 66: 1-19). Physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of the present invention are in particular salts with a nontoxic salt component and preferably are pharmaceutically utilizable salts. They can contain inorganic or organic salt components. Such salts can be formed, for example, from compounds of the present invention which contain an acidic group, for example a carboxylic acid group (HO-CO-) or a sulfonic acid group (HO-S(O)2-) and nontoxic inorganic or organic bases. Suitable bases are, for example, alkali metal compounds or alkaline earth metal compounds, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate, or ammonia, organic amino compounds and quaternary ammonium hydroxides. Reactions of compounds of the present invention with bases for the preparation of the salts are in general carried out according to customary procedures in a solvent or diluent. On account of the physiological and chemical stability, advantageous salts of acidic groups are in many cases sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts or ammonium salts which can also carry one or more organic groups on the nitrogen atom. Compounds of the present invention which contain a basic, i.e. protonatable, group, for example an amino group or another basic heterocycle, can be present in the form of their acid addition salts with physiologically acceptable acids, for example as salt with hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, which in general can be prepared from the compounds of the present invention by reaction with an acid in a solvent or diluent according to customary procedures. As usual, in particular in the case of acid addition salts of a compound containing two or more basic groups, in an obtained salt the ratio of the salt components can deviate upward or downward from the stoichiometric ratio, such as the molar ratio 1:1 or 1:2 in the case of the acid addition salt of a compound of the present invention containing one or two basic groups with a monovalent acid, and vary depending on the applied conditions. The present invention comprises also salts containing the components in a non-stoichiometric ratio, and an indication that an acid addition salt of a compound of the present invention contains an acid in equimolar amount, for example, also allows for a lower or higher amount of acid in the obtained salt, for example about 0.8 or about 1.1 mol of acid per mol of compound of the present invention. If the compounds of the present invention simultaneously contain an acidic and a basic group in the molecule, the invention also includes internal salts (betaines, zwitterions) in addition to the salt forms mentioned. The present invention also comprises all salts of the compounds of the present invention which, because of low physiological tolerability, are not directly suitable for use as a pharmaceutical, but are suitable as intermediates for chemical reactions or for the preparation of physiologically acceptable salts, for example by means of anion exchange or cation exchange. A subject of the present invention also are solvates of the compounds of the present invention and their salts, such as hydrates and adducts with alcohols like (C1-C4)-alkanols, in particular physiologically acceptable solvates, as well as active metabolites of compounds of the present invention.
As used herein and throughout the entire description, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" may in particular mean approved by a regulatory agency or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals, and more particularly in humans.
The present invention comprises all stereoisomeric forms of the compounds of the formula I, for example, all possible enantiomers and diastereomers including cis/trans isomers. The invention likewise comprises mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers including cis/trans isomers, in all ratios. Asymmetric centers contained in the compounds of the formula I for example in unsubstituted or substituted alkyl groups or in the stereogenic carbons CR4R5 and CR2R3, in case that R4 and R5 or R2 and R3 are not equal chemical groups, i.e. not both methyl, for example, depicted in formula I, can all independently of one another have the S configuration or the R configuration. The invention relates to enantiomers, both the levorotatory and the dextrorotatory antipode, in enantiomerically pure form and substantially enantiomerically pure form and in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. The invention likewise relates to diastereomers in the form of pure and substantially pure diastereomers and in the form of mixtures of two or more diastereomers in all ratios. The invention also comprises all cis/trans isomers of the compounds of the formula I, for example, in pure form and substantially pure form and in the form of mixtures of the cis isomer and the trans isomer in all ratios. Cis/trans isomerism can occur in substituted cycloalkane rings for example. The preparation of individual stereoisomers, if desired, can be carried out by resolution of a mixture according to customary methods, for example by chromatography or crystallization, or by use of stereochemically uniform starting compounds in the synthesis or by stereoselective reactions. Optionally, before a separation of stereoisomers a derivatization can be carried out. The separation of a mixture of stereoisomers can be carried out at the stage of the compound of the formula I or at the stage of an intermediate in the course of the synthesis. The invention also comprises all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention.

The compound numbering in Table 1 is equal to the numbering of the Example Compounds in the Examples section herein below.
In a further aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the invention (in particular those specified above with respect to any of formulas (I), (II), (III) and (IV), as well as the compounds of Table 1 for use as medicament.
As it is evident from the examples, the inventors have found that the compounds of the invention inhibit the enzymatic activity of human kallikrein-like peptidase 6 (KLK6). In some embodiments the compounds of the invention are selective inhibitors of human kallikrein-like peptidase 6. In some embodiments, the compounds of the present invention exhibit pharmacological properties (bioavailability, toxicity, side effects, dosing, patient compliance, compatibility, stability, half-life, etc.), which are in at least one aspect superior to the pharmacological properties of known kalikrein inhibitors.
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared as described below or prepared by methods analogous thereto, which are readily known and available to a person of ordinary skill in the art of organic synthesis. The synthetic access to the compounds according to the invention, i.e. the compounds of formulas (I), (II), (III) and (IV) is further illustrated by the example compounds in the description.
For example, the preparation of compounds of the formula I, including their salts, solvates or hydrates can be carried out by the conversion of a primary amine of the formula V to an amide of the formula IX via reaction with compounds of the formulas VI, VII, or VIII as exemplarily shown in the below reaction scheme.
In the first instance, condensation of V and VI can be e.g. accomplished with peptide coupling reagents such as e.g. N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDCI) in the presence of a catalyst like 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) in dichloromethane (DCM) as solvent. The hydroxyl functionality is then revealed by cleavage of the acetyl (Ac) group via saponification of the acetyl ester bond with e.g. sodium methoxide (NaOMe) in methanol (MeOH) to give compounds of the formula IX. In the second instance, reaction of V with acid chloride VII is e.g. conducted in the presence of a base like e.g. triethylamine (Et3N) or diisopropylethylamine (i-Pr2NEt) in DCM. Instead of a chloride any other suitable leaving group known to a person of ordinary skill may be used, such as other halides. Saponification of the acetyl ester can then be conducted with NaOMe as described above to give compounds of the formula IX. In the third instance, the reaction of V and VIII to directly give IX is performed e.g. with EDCI, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT), and i-Pr2NEt in dimethylformamide (DMF). As appreciated by a person of ordinary skill, in these transformations other hydroxyl protecting groups than acetyl (Ac) may be used in formulas VI and VII, i.e. protecting groups stable under the reaction conditions and cleavable under different reaction conditions to allow the preparation of compounds of the formula IX, such as e.g. a benzyl group or a silyl group. Compounds of the formula IX can then be converted into compounds of the formula I via esterification with compounds of the formula X as shown in the reaction scheme above. This can be e.g. conducted with dehydrating agents like e.g. DCC or EDCI in the presence of DMAP and i-Pr2NEt in DCM. It can also be conducted by e.g. first converting the carboxylic acid moiety in X into the corresponding acid chloride by the action of oxalyl chloride with catalytic amounts of DMF in DCM. Subsequent reaction with IX in the presence of a base like Et3N, pyridine, or i-Pr2NEt and catalytic amounts of DMAP in a solvent like DCM or tetrahydrofuran (THF) provides compounds of the formula I. Compounds of the formula IX can also be converted to compounds of the formula IXa via alkylation of the amide nitrogen as shown in the above reaction scheme with e.g. an alkyl halide in DMF with sodium hydride (NaH) as a base. Compounds of the formula IXa can then be reacted with compounds of the formula X to provide compounds of the formula I by way of esterification using e.g. the same methods described above. In these syntheses of compounds of the formula (I) the R groups, in particular R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6, are defined as described throughout this specification. These syntheses are equally applicable to the preparation of compounds of the formulas II, III and IV.
In some instances, compounds of the formulas I, II, IV and V as described herein have an R1 group that is a substituted pyrazole, wherein a nitrogen atom of the pyrazole is bound to an aryl or a heteroaryl group. In these cases, compounds of the formula XIII can be e.g. prepared from a nitro substituted pyrazole XI via Ullmann coupling or nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) reactions as exemplarily shown for an aryl halide XII in the below reaction scheme.
In the first instance, using an Ullman coupling, a pyrazole XI is e.g. heated with an aryl halide or heteroaryl halide (preferably an iodide), an alkali carbonate (e.g. potassium carbonate), catalytic amounts of cuprous iodide (CuI), and the ligand trans-N,N'-di-methylcyclohexane-1,2-diamine to 180 °C in a microwave reactor to give compounds of the formula XIII. In the second instance, using an SNAr reaction, XI may be e.g. heated with an electron poor aryl halide or heteroaryl halide (preferably a fluoride) in the presence of an alkali tert-butoxide (e.g. potassium tert-butoxide) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to give compounds of the formula XIII. As appreciated by a person of ordinary skill, other suitable leaving groups may be used instead of a halide, such as a tosylate. Compounds of the formula XIII can be converted to compounds of the formula V by way of reduction using e.g. hydrogenation with hydrogen (H2) (at atmospheric or elevated pressures) with 10% Pd/C as a catalyst in ethanol (EtOH) as a solvent, or stannous chloride (SnCl2) in EtOH. Compounds of formula V can then be used to prepare compounds of the formula I as described herein above. In these syntheses of compounds of the formula V the R groups, in particular R11, R12, R71, R72, R73, R74 and R75, are defined as described throughout this specification.
Compounds of the formula V can also be prepared via SNAr reaction of an aminopyrazole XIV with an electron-poor aryl halide or heteroaryl halide (preferably a fluoride) as exemplarily shown for an aryl halide in the below reaction scheme.
In this case XIV can be e.g. heated with the electron-poor aryl halide or heteroaryl halide (preferably a fluoride) in the presence of an alkali tert-butoxide (e.g. potassium tert-butoxide) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to give compounds of the formula V. As appreciated by a person of ordinary skill, other suitable leaving groups may be used instead of a halide, such as a tosylate. In these syntheses of compounds of the formula V the R groups, in particular R11, R12, R71, R72, R73, R74 and R75, are defined as described throughout this specification. Compounds of formula V can then be used to prepare compounds of the formula I as described herein above.
In some instances, compounds of the formulas I, II and V as described herein have an R1 group that is a substituted pyrazole, wherein a nitrogen atom of the pyrazole is bound to an alkyl, arylalkyl or heteroarylalkyl group. In these cases, compounds of the formula XVI can be prepared reacting a pyrazole XI with a halide XV, preferably a bromide or an iodide, in a nucleophilic substitution (SN) reaction as exemplarily shown in the below reaction scheme.
In this instance, XI may be heated with the halide XV in the presence of an alkali carbonate, e.g. potassium carbonate, in DMF to give compounds of formula XVI. As appreciated by a person of ordinary skill, other suitable leaving groups may be used instead of a halide, such as a tosylate. Compounds of the formula XVI can be converted into compounds of the formula V by way of reduction using e.g. hydrogenation with H2 (at atmospheric or elevated pressures) with 10% Pd/C as a catalyst in EtOH as a solvent, or SnCl2 in EtOH. In these syntheses of compounds of the formula V the R groups, in particular R11 and R12, are defined as described throughout this specification. Compounds of formula V can then be used to prepare compounds of the formula I as described herein above.
Compounds of the formula I can also be prepared as exemplarily shown in the below reaction scheme by condensation of acids of the formula X with alcohols of the formula XVII using e.g. dehydrating agents like DCC or EDCI in the presence of DMAP and i-Pr2NEt in DCM.
Removal of the benzyl protecting group (Bn) in such substances e.g. with H2 in EtOAc with 10% Pd/C as a catalyst gives acids of the formula XVIII. As appreciated by a person of ordinary skill, in these transformations other carboxylic acid protecting groups than benzyl (Bn) may be used, i.e. protecting groups stable under the reaction conditions and cleavable under different reaction conditions to allow the preparation of compounds of the formula XVIII, such as e.g. a methyl group or a tert-butyl group. The compounds of the formula XVIII can then be converted into compounds of the formula I via amide formation with amines of the formula IXX e.g. with dehydrating agents like DCC or EDCI in DCM, or e.g. via conversion of the carboxylic acid moiety in XVIII to the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride with oxalyl chloride and catalytic amounts of DMF in DCM before reacting with amine IXX in DCM with a base like Et3N or i-Pr2NEt. In these syntheses of compounds of the formula I the R groups, in particular R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6, are defined as described throughout this specification.
In some instances, compounds of the formula I may bear aryl nitro groups or aryl amino groups on R1, R4, R5 or R6. Compounds of the formula I which contain aryl nitro groups on R1, R4, R5, or R6 can be converted into compounds with aryl amino groups of the formula I e.g. via hydrogenation with H2 and 10% Pd/C in EtOAc as exemplarily shown in the below reaction scheme. These substances can be further derivatized to the corresponding N-acyl substances e.g. via the action of acetic anhydride and pyridine in DCM.
In any one of the syntheses described herein additional functional groups can be present in the compounds in protected form or in the form of a precursor group which is later converted into the final group.
The starting compounds and building blocks for the synthesis of the compounds of the formula I are commercially available or can be prepared according to procedures described in the literature or analogously to such procedures.
A person of ordinary skill will appreciate that other routes of synthesis may be employed as well. In particular, other routes of synthesis may in fact be applied to certain embodiments of the compounds disclosed herein. Likewise, other suitable reaction conditions than those described herein regarding e.g. reagents, temperature, solvents, reaction time and the like are known to a person of ordinary skill and/or can be readily selected. The person of ordinary skill is referred to general textbooks, such as March's Advanced Organic Chemistry (Michael B. Smith & Jerry March, Wiley-Interscience, 2000), The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (Camile G. Wermuth, Academia Press, 2003) and Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis (Theodora W. Greene & Peter G.M. Wuts; John Wiley & Sons Inc, 1999).

"Pharmaceutically acceptable salts" comprise, for example, acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of compounds with a solution of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid. Furthermore, where the compound carries an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may include alkali metal salts (e.g., sodium or potassium salts); alkaline earth metal salts (e.g., calcium or magnesium salts); and salts formed with suitable organic ligands (e.g., ammonium, quaternary ammonium and amine cations formed using counteranions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate). Illustrative examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, acetate, adipate, alginate, arginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, butyrate, calcium edetate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, citrate, clavulanate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dihydrochloride, dodecylsulfate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, galactate, galacturonate, gluceptate, glucoheptonate, gluconate, glutamate, glycerophosphate, glycolylarsanilate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hexylresorcinate, hydrabamine, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isobutyrate, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, methanesulfonate, methylsulfate, mucate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, napsylate, nicotinate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine ammonium salt, oleate, oxalate, pamoate (embonate), palmitate, pantothenate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate/diphosphate, phthalate, picrate, pivalate, polygalacturonate, propionate, salicylate, stearate, sulfate, suberate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide, undecanoate, valerate, and the like (see, for example, Berge et al., "Pharmaceutical Salts", J. Pharm. Sci., 66, pp. 1-19 (1977)).
The term "excipient" when used herein is intended to indicate all substances in a pharmaceutical composition which are not active ingredients (e.g., which are therapeutically inactive ingredients that do not exhibit any therapeutic effect in the amount/concentration used), such as, e.g., carriers, binders, lubricants, thickeners, surface active agents, preservatives, emulsifiers, buffers, flavoring agents, colorants, or antioxidants.
The compositions described in the present invention may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible. The "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" may be in the form of a solid, semisolid, liquid, or combinations thereof. Preferably, the carrier is suitable for enteral (such as oral) or parenteral administration (such as intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, spinal or epidermal administration (e.g., by injection or infusion)). Depending on the route of administration, the active compound, i.e., the compound used in the present invention, either alone or in combination with one or more additional active compounds, may be coated in a material to protect the active compound(s) from the action of acids and other natural conditions that may inactivate the active compound.
Examples of suitable aqueous and non-aqueous carriers which may be employed in the pharmaceutical compositions used according to the present invention include water (e.g., water for injection), ethanol, polyols (such as glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and the like), aqueous solutions of a salt, carbohydrate, sugar alcohol, or an amino acid (such as saline or an aqueous amino acid solution), and suitable mixtures and/or buffered forms thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil), and injectable organic esters (such as ethyl oleate). Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of coating materials, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active compounds is known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active compound, use thereof in the pharmaceutical compositions used according to the present invention is contemplated.
The compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the presence of microorganisms may be ensured by sterilization procedures and/or by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Regardless of the route of administration selected, the active compounds, which may be used in a suitable hydrated form, and/or the pharmaceutical compositions used according to the present invention, are formulated into pharmaceutically acceptable dosage forms by conventional methods known to those of skill in the art (cf., e.g., Remington, "The Science and Practice of Pharmacy" edited by Allen, Loyd V., Jr., 22nd edition, Pharmaceutical Sciences, September 2012; Ansel et al., "Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems", 7th edition, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 1999.).
A pharmaceutical composition can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the desired results. The pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more active compounds can be prepared with carriers that will protect the one or more active compounds against rapid release, such as a controlled release formulation, including implants, transdermal patches, and microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid. Methods for the preparation of such compositions are generally known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Sustained and Controlled Release Drug Delivery Systems, J. R. Robinson, ed., Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1978.
To administer a compound used in the present invention by certain routes of administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound may be administered to an individual in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Liposomes include water-in-oil-in-water CGF emulsions as well as conventional liposomes (Strejan et al., J. Neuroimmunol. 7: 27(1984)).
Pharmaceutical compositions typically are sterile and stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage. The composition can be formulated as a solution, microemulsion, liposome, or other ordered structure suitable to high drug concentration. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as mannitol, sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent that delays absorption, for example, monostearate salts and gelatin.
An injectable composition should be sterile and fluid to the extent that the composition is deliverable by syringe. In addition to water, the carrier can be an isotonic buffered saline solution, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), and suitable mixtures thereof. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by sterilization microfiltration.
Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the active compound into a sterile vehicle that contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying
(lyophilization) that yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.
Dosage regimens are adjusted to provide the optimum desired response (e.g., a therapeutic response). For example, a single bolus may be administered, several divided doses may be administered over time or the dose may be proportionally reduced or increased as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the individuals to be treated; each unit contains a predetermined quantity of active compound calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the dosage unit forms used according to the present invention are dictated by and directly dependent on (a) the unique characteristics of the active compound and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and (b) the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active compound for the treatment of sensitivity in individuals.
Examples of pharmaceutically-acceptable antioxidants include: (1) water soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite and the like; (2) oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and (3) metal chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like.
For the therapeutic/pharmaceutical formulations, compositions used according to the present invention include those suitable for enteral administration (such as oral or rectal) or parenteral administration (such as nasal, topical (including vaginal, buccal and sublingual)). The compositions may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods known in the art of pharmacy. The amount of active ingredient (in particular, the amount of a compound used according to the present invention) which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a pharmaceutical composition (such as a single dosage form) will vary depending upon the individual being treated, and the particular mode of administration. The amount of active ingredient which can be combined with a carrier material to produce a single dosage form will generally be that amount of the composition which produces a therapeutic effect.
Generally, out of 100% (for the pharmaceutical formulations/compositions), the amount of active ingredient (in particular, the amount of the compound used according to the present invention, optionally together with other therapeutically active agents, if present in the pharmaceutical formulations/compositions) will range from about 0.01% to about 99%, preferably from about 0.1% to about 70%, most preferably from about 1% to about 30%, wherein the reminder is preferably composed of the one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.
The amount of active ingredient, e.g., a compound used according to the present invention, in a unit dosage form and/or when administered to an individual or used in therapy, may range from about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg (for example, from about 1 mg to about 500 mg, such as from about 10 mg to about 200 mg) per unit, administration or therapy. In certain embodiments, a suitable amount of such active ingredient may be calculated using the mass or body surface area of the individual, including amounts of between about 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg (such as between about 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg), or between about 1 mg/m2 and about 400 mg/m2 (such as between about 3 mg/m2 and about 350 mg/m2 or between about 10 mg/m2 and about 200 mg/m2).
Actual dosage levels of the active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions used according to the present invention may be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active ingredient which is effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, composition, and mode of administration, without being toxic to the patient. The selected dosage level will depend upon a variety of pharmacokinetic factors including the activity of the particular compositions employed, the route of administration, the time of administration, the rate of excretion of the particular compound being employed, the duration of the treatment, other drugs, compounds and/or materials used in combination with the particular compositions employed, the age, sex, weight, condition, general health and prior medical history of the patient being treated, and like factors well known in the medical arts.
A physician or veterinarian having ordinary skill in the art can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the pharmaceutical composition required. For example, the physician or veterinarian could start with doses of the compounds used according to the present invention at levels lower than that required in order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved. In general, a suitable daily dose of a composition used according to the present invention will be that amount of the compound which is the lowest dose effective to produce a therapeutic effect. Such an effective dose will generally depend upon the factors described above. It is preferred that administration be oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous, preferably administered proximal to the site of the target. If desired, the effective daily dose of a pharmaceutical composition may be administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. While it is possible for a compound used according to the present invention to be administered alone, it is preferable to administer the compound as a pharmaceutical formulation/composition.
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition used according to the present invention can take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutical acceptable excipients such as binding agents (e.g., pregelatinised maize starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose), fillers (e.g., lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, calcium hydrogen phosphate), lubricants (e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, silica), disintegrants (e.g., potato starch, sodium starch glycolate), or wetting agents (e.g., sodium lauryl sulphate). Liquid preparations for oral administration can be in the form of, for example, solutions, syrups, or suspensions, or can be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparation can be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g., sorbitol, syrup, cellulose derivatives, hydrogenated edible fats), emulsifying agents (e.g., lecithin, acacia), non-aqueous vehicles (e.g., almond oil, oily esters, ethyl alcohol, fractionated vegetable oils), preservatives (e.g., methyl or propyl-p-hydroxycarbonates, sorbic acids). The preparations can also contain buffer salts, flavouring, coloring and sweetening agents as deemed appropriate. Preparations for oral administration can be suitably formulated to give controlled release of the pharmaceutical composition of the invention.
In one embodiment, the compound is orally administered in a concentration of at most 100 mg/kg body weight (such as at most 50 mg/kg body weight, at most 40 mg/kg body weight, at most 30 mg/kg body weight, at most 20 mg/kg body weight, at most 10 mg/kg body weight, at most 5 mg/kg body weight, at most 4 mg/kg body weight, at most 3 mg/kg body weight, at most 2 mg/kg body weight, at most 1 mg/kg body weight).
In one embodiment, the compound is parenterally administered (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously), in a concentration of at most 10 mg/kg body weight (such as at most 5 mg/kg body weight, at most 4 mg/kg body weight, at most 3 mg/kg body weight, at most 2 mg/kg body weight, at most 1 mg/kg body weight, at most 0.5 mg/kg body weight, at most 0.4 mg/kg body weight, at most 0.3 mg/kg body weight, at most 0.2 mg/kg body weight, at most 0.1 mg/kg body weight).
The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Oral formulation can include standard carriers such as pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharine, cellulose, magnesium carbonate, etc.
The pharmaceutical composition used according to the present invention can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, for example, by bolus injection or continuous infusion. In one embodiment, the compounds or compositions used according to the present invention may be administered by slow continuous infusion over a long period, such as more than 24 hours, in order to reduce toxic side effects. The administration may also be performed by continuous infusion over a period of from 2 to 24 hours, such as of from 2 to 12 hours. Such regimen may be repeated one or more times as necessary, for example, after 6 months or 12 months.
In yet another embodiment, the compounds or compositions used according to the present invention are administered by maintenance therapy, such as, e.g., once a week for a period of 6 months or more.
Formulations for injection can be presented in units dosage form (e.g., in phial, in multi-dose container), and with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical composition used according to the present invention can take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the agent can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle (e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water) before use. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition can also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration.
Compositions used according to the present invention which are suitable for vaginal administration also include pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or spray formulations containing such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal administration of compositions used according to the present invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any preservatives, buffers, or propellants which may be required.
Therapeutic/pharmaceutical compositions can be administered with medical devices known in the art. For example, in a preferred embodiment, a therapeutic/pharmaceutical composition used according to the present invention can be administered with a needleless hypodermic injection device, such as the devices disclosed in US 5,399,163; US 5,383,851; US 5,312,335; US 5,064,413; US 4,941,880; US 4,790,824; or US 4,596,556. Examples of well-known implants and modules useful in the present invention include those described in: US 4,487,603, which discloses an implantable micro-infusion pump for dispensing medication at a controlled rate; US 4,486,194, which discloses a therapeutic device for administering medicants through the skin; US 4,447,233, which discloses a medication infusion pump for delivering medication at a precise infusion rate; US 4,447,224, which discloses a variable flow implantable infusion apparatus for continuous drug delivery; US 4,439,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system having multi-chamber compartments; and US 4,475,196, which discloses an osmotic drug delivery system.
Many other such implants, delivery systems, and modules are known to those skilled in the art. In certain embodiments, the compounds used according to the present invention can be formulated to ensure proper distribution in vivo. For example, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) excludes many highly hydrophilic compounds. To ensure that the compounds used according to the present invention cross the BBB (if desired), they can be formulated, for example, in liposomes. For methods of manufacturing liposomes, see, e.g., US 4,522,811; US 5,374,548; and US 5,399,331. The liposomes may comprise one or more moieties which are selectively transported into specific cells or organs, and thus enhance targeted drug delivery (see, e.g., V.V. Ranade (1989) J. Clin. Pharmacol. 29: 685). Exemplary targeting moieties include folate or biotin (see, e.g., US 5,416,016 to Low et al.); mannosides (Umezawa et al., (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153: 1038); antibodies (P.G. Bloeman et al. (1995) FEBS Lett. 357: 140; M. Owais et al. (1995) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 39: 180); and surfactant protein A receptor (Briscoe et al. (1995) Am. J. Physiol. 1233: 134).
In one embodiment, the compounds used according to the present invention are formulated in liposomes. In a more preferred embodiment, the liposomes include a targeting moiety. In a most preferred embodiment, the compounds in the liposomes are delivered by bolus injection to a site proximal to the desired area. Such liposome-based composition should be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists, should be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and should be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.
A "therapeutically effective dosage" for therapy/treatment can be measured by objective responses which can either be complete or partial. A complete response (CR) is defined as no clinical, radiological or other evidence of a condition, disorder or disease. A partial response (PR) results from a reduction in disease of greater than 50%. Median time to progression is a measure that characterizes the durability of the objective tumor response.
A "therapeutically effective dosage" for therapy/treatment can also be measured by its ability to stabilize the progression of a condition, disorder or disease. The ability of a compound to inhibit KLK6 can be evaluated by using an appropriate assay known to the skilled practitioner, such as the in vitro assay described herein measuring the KLK6 activity/inhibition. Alternatively, the properties of a compound described in the present invention can be evaluated by examining the ability of the compound in appropriate animal model systems known to the skilled practitioner. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound used according to the present invention can cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate, improve or affect the condition, disorder or disease or the symptoms of the condition, disorder or disease or the predisposition toward the condition, disorder or disease in an individual. One of ordinary skill in the art would be able to determine such amounts based on such factors as the individual's size, the severity of the individual's symptoms, and the particular composition or route of administration selected.
The pharmaceutical composition used according to the invention can also, if desired, be presented in a pack, or dispenser device which can contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active compound. The pack can for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as blister pack. The pack or dispenser device can be accompanied with instruction for administration.

Tests to determine a disease associated with kallikrein-like peptidase 6 overexpression by measuring the amount of KLK6 protein in a sample from a subject are known to the person skilled in the art. On a general basis, the amount of KLK6 protein in a sample can be determined using different assays or detection methods known to those skilled in the art, such as UV/VIS spectroscopy, colorimetric assays, immunoassays, mass spectrometry and radiolabelling, just to name some. A variety of quantitative immunoassays such as quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of human KLK6 have been described in the art, inter alia inXi, Y., Zhang, Y., Fang, J., Wilson, J. J., Luo, S., and Huang, R-P, Development of Monoclonal Antibodies and Characterization of an ELISA Platform Against Kallikrein-Related Peptidase 6 as a Tumor Biomarker, Monoclonal Antibodies in Immunodiagnosis and Immunotherapy, 2015, 34(5): 346-353. DOI: 10.1089/mab.2015.0019, and are commercially provided (e.g. human KLK6 ELISA Kit, Catalog-No. EHKLK6, Thermofischer, human KLK6 ELISA, Catalog-No. RAB0704-1KT, Sigma Aldrich, or human KLK6 ELISA, CODE: ELH-KLK6-1, RayBiotech). Alternatively, immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods can be applied for determining the expression of KLK6 protein directly in discrete tissue components. In this regard, IHC combines anatomical, immunological and biochemical techniques to identify KLK6 protein with specific anti-KLK6-antibodies tagged with a visible label. IHC makes it possible to visualize the distribution and localization of KLK6 within cells and in the proper tissue context. While there are multiple approaches and permutations in IHC methodology, all of the steps involved are separated into two groups: sample preparation and labeling. The immunohistochemical analysis of KLK6 with commercial antibodies has been described for example inKrenzer, S., Peterziel, H., Mauch, C., Blaber, S. I., Blaber, M., Angel, P., and Hess, J., (2011), Expression and Function of the Kallikrein-Related Peptidase 6 in the Human Melanoma Microenvironment, J. Invest. Dermatol., 131(11): 2281-2288. doi:10.1038/jid.2011.190. Following this reference, paraffin sections can, for example, be stained according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain Elite ABC Kit and ImmPRESS Kit, Vector Laboratories, Lörrach, Germany). Primary and secondary antibodies are listed in Table 2.

As substrates, liquid DAB Substrates or AEC Substrate Chromogen (Dako, Hamburg, Germany), or VectorRed and Histogreen (Vector Laboratories) can, for example, be used. All tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany). In addition to commercially available antibodies, newly made can of course also be employed in the detection of KKL6. Such "homemade" antibodies for use in a KLK6 detection method as described herein can be produced, for example by using the method described for the production of MPS-specific antibodies by Scarisbrick, I. A., Asakura, K., Blaber, S., Blaber, M., Isackson, P. J., Bieto, T., Rodrigues, M., and Windebank, A., Preferential expression of myelencephalon specific protease by oligodendrocytes of the adult rat spinal cord white matter. Glia. 2000;30:219-230. Following this reference an antibody recognizing rat MSP was, for example, reported to be generated against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 108-131 of the predicted amino acid sequence of rat MSP (Scarisbrick et al., 1997b). For this purpose, the following experimental protocol was used.
Unconjugated peptide was produced at the Mayo Protein Core Facility (431 Peptide Synthesizer, Applied Biosystems). The peptide was emulsified in equal ratios of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) and 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. Balb/c mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were immunized in the rear footpad with 50 ml of the FCA emulsion. At 7-day intervals over a period of 49 days, each mouse was given an intravenous (IV) boost of 50 mg peptide dissolved in 1 ml PBS. At 56 days, the mice were bled and the sera were screened for their ability to produce immunostaining in spinal cord tissue sections in a pattern resembling the known distribution of MSP mRNA (Scarisbrick et al., 1997b). Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO). Splenic lymphocytes of mice whose sera produced strong cellular labeling mirroring the expression pattern of MSP mRNA in the spinal cord white matter were fused with myeloma cells. The protocol used for generation of B-cell hybridomas was previously described by Faedas de St. Groth and Scheidegger (1980). Briefly, spleens were removed from mice 3 days after intravenous boosting with antigen. Single-cell suspensions were prepared and red blood cells lysed with ammonium chloride buffer. Splenic lymphocytes and F/O myeloma cells (nonsecreting myeloma derived from sp2/0 Balb/c myeloma cells) were mixed at a 5:1 ratio and centrifuged to form a pellet. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of a 50% solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1540, then incubated at 37°C for 90 s. Cells were washed and resuspended in fresh media, and 100-ml aliquots were added to the wells of microtiter plates. After 24 h, 100 ml culture medium supplemented with 1 M hypoxanthine (HT), 4 mM aminopterin, and 0.16 M thymidine (HAT), were added to each well. Every 3- 4 days thereafter, 100 ml culture medium was replaced with 100 ml fresh medium containing HAT, HT, and complete medium without HAT, successively over a period of approximately 14 days. Upon reaching 75% confluency, the culture supernatants were screened by immunohistochemisty for the presence of specific relevant antibody, as above. The hybridomas of interest were then cloned in limiting dilution cultures at 1 cell per microtiter well. Balb/c spleen cells served as feeder layer cells for fusion and cloning microtiter plates (3 x 10^5 per well). Fused cells were grown in 96-well plates in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, containing 10.0% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Clones producing a pattern of immunolabeling resembling the known distribution of MSP mRNA were subcloned at 0.3 cells per microtiter well. The supernatants of subclones were screened as above and selected for production of ascites or hybridoma cell culture supernatants. For generation of ascites, Balb/c mice were primed with an intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 ml prisane oil (Sigma, T-7640); 3-14 days later, 1-2 3x10^6 hybridoma cells in 0.5 ml PBS were injected intraperitoneally. Daily collections of ascites fluid began after 7-10 days. Ascites fluid was diluted with equal amounts of PBS. Ascites and cell culture supernatants were isotyped as IgG or IgM, using a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit (IsoStrip, Boehringer-Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).
The antibodies produces by the method of Scarisbrick et al. can be successfully applied to histochemistry staining as disclosed by Drucker, K. L., Paulsen, A. R., Giannini, C., Decker, P. A., Blaber, S. I., Blaber, M., Uhm, J. H., O'Neill, B. P., Jenkins, R. B., and Scarisbrick, I. A., 2013, Clinical significance and novel mechanism of action of kallikrein 6 in glioblastoma, Neuro-Oncology, 15(3): 305-318. doi:10.1093/neuonc/nos313. In this regard, KLK6 immunoreactivity (IR) can be detected using a KLK6-specific monoclonal antibody (MSP-3-3) as described in detail in Scarisbrick et al. Briefly, deparaffinized sections were treated with citrate solution (BioGenex), and purified primary antibody was applied to sections at a concentration of 10 mg/mL for 18 h at 48C. After sequential application of biotinylated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories), followed by peroxidaseconjugated streptavidin, each for 1 h at 208C (DAKO), IR was visualized using 3',3'-diaminobenzadine tetrahydrochloride as the substrate. All immunostained sections were counterstained with Gills hematoxylin and imaged with a Bliss digital imaging system that pairs an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) with a slide scanner (Bacus Laboratories). KLK6 IR in each tumor core was evaluated independently by 2 observers without knowledge of tumor type or demographic information. In each case, a score was assigned for staining intensity (range 1-3: low, medium, high) and for percent of the tumor core stained (range 1-4 in 25% increments). The final IR score for each tumor was assessed as the product of staining intensity and percent stained. Scores across multiple cores from the same tumor and across the 2 independent observers were averaged. Additional highresolution images were prepared using 100X-oil immersion objective and an Olympus BX51 microscope fitted with an Olympus DP71 camera.
Further, there exist methods in the art suitable for detecting KLK6 expression under in vivo conditions. Such methods may be suitable for the in vivo diagnosis of a disease associated with an increased KLK6 expression in a subject, thereby using e.g. labelled anti-KLK6-antibodies having high molecular specificity to KLK6. Such anti-KLK6-antibodies may be applied to analyze KLK6 levels at local site, and can be applied in combination with standard in vivo molecular imaging techniques, such as single photon emission tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), optical imaging, ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging, which offer unique molecular sensitivity.
The "sample" used for determining or measuring the amount of KLK6 by using any of the methods described herein refers to a sample obtained from a subject as described herein. To this end, it is envisaged to compare the obtained results to the results of a reference sample taken from a reference subject. The reference subject as described herein is preferably a subject not suffering from a disease associate with KLK6-overexpression. Hence, an increased amount of KLK6 protein as compared to a reference sample is indicative for a disease associate with KLK6-overexpression, whereas no difference as compared to the reference sample indicates that said subject has no disease associate with KLK6-overexpression. In this context, the sample obtained from the subject of the present invention may be any biological sample taken from said subject and being appropriate to determine the amount of KLK6 protein and thus for diagnosing a disease associate with KLK6-overexpression. Non-limiting examples of useful samples may include blood samples, tissues samples, body fluid samples, skin samples or any other samples known to those skilled in the art for use in in vitro diagnosis.
Equally when applying in vivo molecular imaging techniques in combination with labelled anti-KLK6-antibodies having high molecular specificity to KLK6, KLK6 protein can be detecting using said non-invasive molecular imaging method, thereby collecting imaging data and comparing the imaging data to reference imaging data of the reference subject. Here, an increased signal in the imaging data from the subject as compared to reference imaging data is indicative for a disease associate with KLK6-overexpression, whereas no difference in the imaging signal as compared to reference imaging data indicates that said subject has no disease associate with KLK6-overexpression.
The terms "disease", "disorder" and "condition", when used in the context of treatment or therapy (including prophylactic therapy), are used herein interchangeably and refer to any pathological state, including cancer, in particular those pathological states (including cancer forms) described herein.

EXAMPLES
1) Determination of Biochemical Inhibition Values
The activity of the compounds was tested against KLK6 (produced in insect cells, according to the procedure reported in J. Biol. Chem. 2002, 277, 24562-24570). In addition, the activity of the compounds was tested against Trypsin (Polymum, TRY001-010), Thrombin (Biopur, 10-13-1104-01 1000U) and Factor Xa (Enzo Life Sciences, BML-SE362). Trypsin, Thrombin and Factor Xa were chosen since these enzymes are structurally similar to KLK6. However, Trypsin, Thrombin and Factor Xa are targets that are important for other biological processes. In particular, Trypsin, Thrombin and Factor Xa are involved in the blood coagulation cascade. Therefore, these enzymes are preferably not affected by the KLK6 inhibitors of the present invention.
Procedure:
In a 384 well plate, 5 µL of eleven concentrations of inhibitor in 8% DMSO (serial dilution 2:1) and a blank were incubated with an equal amount of enzyme (KLK6, Thrombin, Trypsin or Factor Xa) diluted in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween20 assay buffer for 30 minutes. Then, 10 µL of the fluorogenic substrate FSR-AMC (Bachem, I-1400) were added to each well and the increase in fluorescence was measured with FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader (Ex: 355, Em: 440-10) for 30 minutes. Inhibition of the enzyme as a function of the inhibitor concentration was used to generate dose response curves, which allowed estimating IC50 values, according to the following equation in GraphPad Prism: y=ymin+ymax−ymin/1+10LogIC50−x*HillSlope
Assay final concentrations:KLK6: 5 nMTrypsin: 0.88 ng/mLThrombin: 9.8·10-5 NIH unit/mLFactor Xa: 4 nMFSR-AMC: 20 µM
The IC50 values are shown in the following Table 3.

General
Analytical thin layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on Merck silica gel 60 F254 TLC plates. TLC visualization was accomplished using 254 nm UV light or charring solutions of KMnO4, cerric ammonium molybdate, or p-anisaldehyde.

To a stirring solution of the acid from step 1 (146.1 mg, 0.6 mmol) in dry DCM (8 mL), DCC (123.7 mg, 0.6 mmol) was added slowly, then a spatula tip of DMAP and finally N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (92 mg, 0.4 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The crude suspension was stirred overnight and then filtered to remove the DCU precipitate. The product was first purified by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in hexane) and then by HPLC to yield the title compound as its trifluoroacetate salt (34%)

3) Stability Assay
The stability of the synthesized Example Compounds 1, 38 and 81 in cell culture medium has been investigated.
Procedure:
In order to measure the stability of the synthesized Example Compounds in cell culture medium, an NMR-based assay has been developed. A solution of the Example Compound (∼8mM) in DMSO-d6 is diluted 1:3 with the cell buffer (i.e. DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) + 10% Fetal Calf Serum (FCS), + 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, + 1mM c-Glutamine), and observed by NMR at 37°C for a total of 16 hours. The stability of the compounds can be conveniently monitored by comparing the integration of the starting material peak and the corresponding appearing hydrolysis product peak. Also, the absorbance of the starting material peak has been used as a double check. The expected hydrolysis reaction of the ester moiety is reported below for Example Compound 1, and is the same for all compounds:
The results are depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3. As shown by the results depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3, the stability of the compounds was totally enhanced from Example Compound 1 to Example Compounds bearing the 3-substituted indole, such as Example Compound 38. Moreover, the presence of a methyl group in α-position to the ester (i.e. Example Compound 81) supplies further stabilizing properties, although such a modification results in loss of inhibitory potency.
It will be clear that the invention may be practiced otherwise than as particularly described in the foregoing description and examples. Numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings and, therefore, are within the scope of the appended claims.
