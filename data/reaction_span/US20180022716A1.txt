TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a compound having a polymerizable group, a polymerizable composition containing the compound, a polymerizable liquid crystal composition and an optically anisotropic body using the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.
BACKGROUND ART
A compound having a polymerizable group (polymerizable compound) is used for various optical materials. For example, after a polymerizable composition containing a polymerizable compound is aligned in a liquid-crystal state, it can be polymerized to produce a polymer having a uniform alignment. Such a polymer can be used for polarizers, retarders and the like necessary for displays. In many cases, for satisfying required optical properties, polymerization speed, solubility, melting point, glass transition temperature, polymer transparency, mechanical strength, surface hardness, heat resistance and lightproofness, a polymerizable composition containing two or more kinds of polymerizable compounds is used. In such a case, the polymerizable compounds to be used are desired to impart good physical properties to the polymerizable composition without having any negative influence on the other properties.
For improving the viewing angle of a liquid crystal display, it is desired to reduce the wavelength dispersion characteristic of birefringence of a retardation film, or to reverse it. As a material for the purpose, various polymerizable liquid crystal compounds having a reversed wavelength dispersion characteristic or a low wavelength dispersion characteristic have been developed. However, such a polymerizable compound causes crystal precipitation when added to a polymerizable composition and the storage stability thereof is insufficient (PTL 2 and PTL 3). On the other hand, in the case where a polymerizable composition is applied onto a substrate and polymerized thereon and the resultant filmy polymer is irradiated with UV light, there occur a problem that the filmy polymer often discolors or peels off from the substrate (PTL 1 to PTL 3). When the discolored or peeled film is used, for example, in a display, the brightness of the picture plane may be uneven, or the color may be unnatural, or intended optical characteristics could not be obtained, and there occurs a problem that the quality of display products is significantly lowered. Consequently, development of a polymerizable liquid crystal compound having a reversed wavelength dispersion property or a low wavelength dispersion property capable of solving the problems is desired.

(In the formulae, n represents an integer of 0 to 20.)
In the case where the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the compound of the present invention is used in applications for films, optical devices, functional pigments, medicines, cosmetics, coating agents, synthetic resins, etc., metals, metal complexes, dyes, pigments, colorants, fluorescent materials, phosphorescent materials, surfactants, leveling agents, thixotropic agents, gelling agents, polysaccharides, UV absorbents, IR absorbents, antioxidants, ion-exchange resins, metal oxides such as titanium oxide or the like may be added thereto, depending on the intended purposes.
Polymers to be obtained by polymerizing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the compound of the present invention can be used in various applications. For example, polymers obtained though polymerization with no alignment of the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the compound of the present invention are usable as light-scattering plates, depolarizers, moire stripe inhibitors. Polymers obtained by polymerizing the composition after alignment are usable as having optical anisotropy. Such optically anisotropic bodies can be produced, for example, by making the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the compound of the present invention supported by a substrate rubbed with cloth or the like, by a substrate with an organic thin film formed thereon, or by a substrate having an alignment film of SiO2 formed thereon through orthorhombic deposition thereon, or by making the composition sandwiched between such substrates, and thereafter polymerizing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.
The method of making the polymerizable liquid crystal composition supported by a substrate includes methods of spin coating, die coating, extrusion coating, roll coating, wire bar coating, gravure coating, spray coating, dipping, printing, etc. In coating, an organic solvent may be added to the polymerizable liquid crystal composition. The usable organic solvent includes hydrocarbon solvents, halogenohydrocarbon solvents, ether solvents, alcohol solvents, ketone solvents, ester solvents, aprotic solvents. For example, the hydrocarbon solvent include toluene, hexane; the halogenohydrocarbon solvents include methylene chloride; the ether solvents include tetrahydrofuran, acetoxy-2-ethoxyethane, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate; alcohol solvents include methanol, ethanol, isopropanol; ketone solvents include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, γ-butyrolactone, N-methylpyrrolidinones; the ester solvents include ethyl acetate, cellosolve; the aprotic solvents include dimethylformamide, acetonitrile. One or more of these may be used either singly or as combined, and may be adequately selected in consideration of the vapor pressure and the solubility of the polymerizable liquid crystal composition therein. The method for evaporating the added organic solvent includes spontaneous drying, drying by heating, drying under reduced pressure, drying by heating under reduced pressure. For further improving the coatability with the polymerizable liquid crystal composition, it is also effective to provide an interlayer such as a polyimide thin layer or the like on a substrate, or to add a leveling agent to the polymerizable liquid crystal material. The method of providing an interlayer such as a polyimide thin layer or the like on a substrate is effective for improving the adhesion between the polymer to be produced through polymerization of the polymerizable liquid crystal material, and a substrate.
Other alignment treatments than the above include use of flow alignment of a liquid crystal material, or use of an electric field or a magnetic field. One alone or two or more of these alignment methods may be used either singly or as combined. Further, as an alignment treatment method in place of rubbing, a photo-alignment method is also employable. Regarding the shape of the substrate, those having a curved constituent part may be used in addition to a flat plate. As the material to constitute the substrate, any of organic materials or inorganic materials can be used. Examples of the organic materials for the substrate include polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonate, polyimide, polyamide, polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polytetrafluoroethylene, polychlorotrifluoroethylene, polyarylate, polysulfone, triacetyl cellulose, cellulose, polyether ether ketone, etc. Examples of the inorganic materials include silicon, glass, calcite, etc.
In polymerizing the polymerizable liquid crystal composition containing the compound of the present invention, preferably, the polymerization is carried out rapidly. Accordingly, a method of polymerization with irradiation with active energy rays such as UV rays, electron beams or the like is preferred. In the case of using UV rays, a polarization light source may be used, or a non-polarization light source may be used. In the case where the polymerization is carried out while the liquid crystal composition is sandwiched between two substrates, at least the substrate on the irradiation side must have suitable transparency relative to active energy rays. In addition, a method of polymerizing only a specific part by using a mask during photoirradiation, and thereafter changing the alignment state of the unpolymerized part by changing the condition of an electric field, a magnetic field, a temperature or the like, followed by further irradiation with active energy rays for polymerization may also be employed. The temperature in irradiation is preferably within a temperature range capable of keeping the liquid-crystal state of the polymerizable liquid crystal composition of the present invention. In particular, in the case of producing an optically anisotropic body through photopolymerization, preferably, the polymerization is carried out at a temperature near to room temperature wherever possible, that is, typically at a temperature of 25° C. from the viewpoint of evading induction of any unintended thermal polymerization. The intensity of the active energy rays is preferably 0.1 mW/cm to 2 mW/cm. When the intensity is less than 0.1 mW/cm2, a lot of time is needed to complete the photopolymerization and the productivity is thereby worsened, and when more than 2 mW/cm2, there may occur a risk of degradation of the polymerizable liquid crystal compound or the polymerizable liquid crystal composition.
The optically anisotropic body obtained by polymerization may be heat-treated for reducing the initial characteristic changes thereof to realize stable characteristic expression. The heat treatment temperature is preferably within a range of 50 to 250° C., and the heat treatment time is preferably within 30 seconds to 12 hours.
The optically anisotropic body thus produced according to the method as above may be used as a single substance thereof as peeled from the substrate, or may be used without being peeled. The resultant optically anisotropic body may be layered, or may be stuck to any other substrate.

In the compositions of the following Examples and Comparative Examples, “%” means “% by mass”. In handling a substance unstable to oxygen and/or water in each step, the operation is preferably carried out in an inert gas such as nitrogen gas, argon gas, etc. Ordinary post-treatment is an operation to carry out the intended compound from a reaction liquid, and means an operation generally carried out by those skilled in the art, such as reaction quenching, liquid-liquid separation/extraction, neutralization, washing, drying, condensation, etc.

For evaluation of storage stability, the stable storage concentration of the targeted compound was measured. Regarding the stable storage concentration, the targeted compound was added to the mother liquid crystal to have a concentration of 5% to 25% at intervals of 5% to prepare different compositions, and the thus-prepared compositions were left at 17.5° C. for 10 weeks. The maximum addition concentration of the compound not having caused crystal precipitation was defined as the stable storage concentration of the compound. The compound having a large value of the maximum addition concentration has a large stable storage concentration, therefore meaning that the compound is free from crystal precipitation in long-term storage.
For measuring the stable storage concentration, a liquid crystal composition composed of 30% of the compound (X-1) described in JP 2005-015473 A, 30% of the compound (X-2) described in WO2009/122868 A1 and 40% of the compound (x-3) described in JP 2002-542219 A was used as a mother liquid crystal (X). The evaluation results are shown in the following Table.

According to a spin coating method, a polyimide solution for alignment film was applied onto a glass substrate having a thickness of 0.7 mm, dried at 100° C. for 10 minutes, and baked at 200° C. for 60 minutes to form a coating film thereon. The resultant film was rubbed. For the rubbing, a commercially-available rubbing device was used.
The target compound was added to the mother liquid crystal (X) in a ratio of 50% to prepare a composition. A photopolymerization initiator, Irgacure 907 (manufactured by BASF) in a ratio of 1%, 4-methoxyphenol in a ratio of 0.1% and chloroform in a ratio of 80% were added to the resultant composition to prepare a coating liquid. The coating liquid was applied onto the rubbed glass substrate according to a spin coating method. This was dried at 80° C. for 1 minute and further dried at 120° C. for 1 minute. Subsequently, using a high-pressure mercury lamp, this was irradiated with UV rays at an intensity of 40 mW/cm2 for 25 seconds. In that manner, 10 sheets of evaluation target films were produced for every target compound. Example numbers of the films and the target compound used therein are shown in the following Table.

Next, using a xenon lamp irradiation tester (Suntest XLS, manufactured by Atlas), the produced 10 films were tested for exposure at 60 mW/cm2, 26° C. and 120 J. The resultant films were visually checked for outward appearance including discoloration, peeling, etc.
<Discoloration>
The tested 10 films were analyzed to measure the yellow index (YI) thereof. The difference between the YI mean value of the 10 films before the test and the YI mean value of the 10 films after the test (ΔYI) was calculated. Briefly, the absorption spectrum of the polymer was measured using JASCO UV/VIS Spectrophotometer V-560, and the yellow index (YI) was calculated using the accompanying color diagnostic program. The calculation expression is:
<in-line-formulae>YI=100(1.28X−1.06Z)/Y(JIS K7373)</in-line-formulae>
(where X, Y and Z each indicates the tristimulus values in the XYZ color system).
A larger ΔYI value means that the film discolored more after the exposure test.
<Peeling>
Each film was cross-cut in 10 cuts in length x 10 cuts in width, totaling 100 cuts. After the exposure test, the number of the peeled cuts was counted in every film, and expressed as a ratio (%) of the peeled cuts to the total 1000 cuts (100 cuts/sheet x 10 sheets).
The results are shown in the following Table.
