FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to diamino-2-phthalimidodiphenyl ether, derivatives therefor and methods for preparing them. These compounds are useful as raw materials for highly functional polymers including polyimides, and various organic compounds. The present invention further relates to an intermediate for diamino-2-phthalimidodiphenyl ether, i.e., aminonitro-2-phthalimidodiphenyl ether, dinitro-2-phthalimidodiphenyl ether and derivatives from these, and methods for preparing them.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Recently, polymer materials have been desired which have high heat resistance, high tenacity in extreme conditions such as in cosmic space, and easy moldability. Patent Literature 1 describes a method of attaining high heat resistance in molding without generating volatile components by heat curing while maintaining good processability wherein a polyimide oligomer is heated and capped with a capping agent such as phenylethynylphthalic anhydride, molded, heated and, then, crosslinked and cured at the phenylethynyl group. Patent Literature 2 discloses a method for improving flowability and processability of an oligomer using asymmetric tetracarboxylic anhydride in the preparation of a composite of carbon fiber and polyimide. A cardo-type diamine is used in Patent Literature 3. The asymmetric diamine disclosed in Patent Literature 4 is 2-(4-aminophenoxy)-5-aminobiphenyl.
In particular, 2-(4-aminophenoxy)-5-aminobiphenyl described in Patent Literature 4 is a raw material for preparing a polymer having high heat resistance, high tenacity and easy moldability and broadens the potentiality of asymmetric polyimides (Non-Patent Literature 1). Non-Patent Literature 2 describes that many of asymmetric polyimides have a high melt flowability on account of active segmental movement at a temperature higher than a glass-transition temperature. Therefore, further asymmetric diamines are desired to be used as a raw material of asymmetric polyimides.
