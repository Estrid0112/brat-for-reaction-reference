BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
This specification discloses, inter alia, drug compounds that inhibit cell proliferation, antibody-drug conjugates made therefrom, drug-linker compounds for making such conjugates, uses of such compounds and their antibody-drug conjugates, and methods and intermediates for their making.
Double helical DNA has two longitudinal spiral grooves running along its exterior, much like the stripes on a barbershop pole. The two grooves are not identical: one, called the major groove, is much wider than the other, called the minor groove.
The width of the minor groove is approximately equal to the thickness of a benzene ring. Many biologically active DNA-binding molecules-whether synthetic or naturally occurring-are substantially planar polyaromatic molecules having an arcuate footprint, such shape enabling them to fit snugly into the minor groove. For short, a DNA minor groove binding molecule is referred to herein as an MGB, or minor groove binder.
One type of MGB is a dimer of two polyaromatic units, each comprising a benzodiazepine and a tetrahydroisoquinoline (“THIQ”) ring system, as shown by the representative structure below. Such MGBs are disclosed in Zhang et al. 2016, McDonald et al. 2016, and Junutula et al. 2016.
Another type of MGB is also a dimer of two polyaromatic units, but in this instance comprising a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (“PBD”) ring system, as illustrated by the structure below. Bose et al. 1992 and Thurston et al. 1993 are exemplary publications disclosing such MGBs.
Yet another type of MGB is represented by the natural products distamycin and netropsin, comprising aminopyrrolecarboxylic acid moieties linked by amide bonds:
Still yet another type of MGB is represented by the natural products duocarmycin SA and yatakemycin, which have a characteristic cyclopropapyrroloindole (“CPI”) subunit and are therefore often referred to as CPI compounds. Members in this class include their seco (ring-opened) counterparts.
There exist a number of disclosures of synthetic compounds combining structural features from different types of MGBs. Rahman et al. 2013 disclose compounds combining a PBD moiety and a distamycin-like moiety, such as:
Zhang et al. 2016 and Junutula et al. 2016 disclose MGB heterodimers comprising one THIQ containing unit and one PBD unit. An illustrative structure is shown below.
Yet other disclosures of compounds combining different MGB moieties include: Ahmed et al. 2012; Baraldi et al. 1998 and 1999; Demayanthi et al. 1999; Kumar and Lown 2002 and 2003; Kumar et al. 2002 and 2005; Reddy et al. 2000; Tercel et al. 2003; Thurston et al. 2016; and Wells et al. 2006.
The biological activity of MGBs derives from their ability to bind to DNA and disrupt its transcription and, in some instances, chemically react with DNA and damage it. Consequently, many MGBs are highly cytotoxic. There is interest in the use of MGBs for the treatment of cancer, as their cytotoxicity can make them effective in killing cancer cells.
A type of anticancer agent that is generating strong interest is a conjugate, in which a drug is attached to a targeting agent that binds to a ligand on the cancer cell. The targeting agent, by binding to its ligand, directs the drug to the cancer cell, where it is released by one of several mechanisms, to act on the cancer cell.
A common type of conjugate is an antibody-drug conjugate (“ADC,” also referred to as an immunoconjugate). In an ADC, a drug (synonymously therapeutic agent, cytotoxin, payload, or warhead) is covalently linked to an antibody whose antigen is a tumor associated antigen-i.e., an antigen expressed by a cancer cell. MGBs have potential as the drug in an ADC.
The moiety covalently linking the antibody and the drug is referred to as the linker. Where each antibody has one drug attached to it, the structure of an ADC can be represented generically as:[Antibody]-[Linker]-[Drug]
The antibody, upon binding to its antigen, delivers the ADC to the cancer site. There, cleavage of the linker or degradation of the antibody releases the drug. Frequently, the ADC is internalized by endocytosis into the target cell and release of the drug takes place inside it. While the ADC is circulating in the blood, the drug is held inactive because of its linkage to the antibody. Consequently, the drug in an ADC can be much more potent (cytotoxic) than an ordinary chemotherapy agent because its localized release reduces systemic toxicity. For a review on ADCs, see Schrama et al. 2006.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
There is provided a heterodimeric compounds comprising a benzodiazepine-containing moiety in one half and an aromatic polyamide moiety in the other half. Such compounds are biologically active, inhibiting the proliferation of cells (especially cancer cells), and can be used as anticancer agents, particularly as the drug component in an ADC. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that such heterodimeric compounds function like MGBs and derive their biological activity from an ability to bind to DNA and/or damage it chemically.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION
Definitions
“Antibody” means whole antibodies and any antigen binding fragment (i.e., “antigen-binding portion”) or single chain variants thereof. A whole antibody is a protein comprising at least two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain comprises a heavy chain variable region (VH) and a heavy chain constant region comprising three domains, CH1, CH2 and CH3. Each light chain comprises a light chain variable region (VL or Vk) and a light chain constant region comprising one single domain, CL. The VH and VL regions can be further subdivided into regions of hypervariability, termed complementarity determining regions (CDRs), interspersed with more conserved framework regions (FRs). Each VH and VL comprises three CDRs and four FRs, arranged from amino- to carboxy-terminus in the following order: FR1, CDR1, FR2, CDR2, FR3, CDR3, and FR4. The variable regions contain a binding domain that interacts with an antigen. The constant regions may mediate the binding of the antibody to host tissues or factors, including various cells of the immune system (e.g., effector cells) and the first component (Clq) of the classical complement system. An antibody is said to “specifically bind” to an antigen X if the antibody binds to antigen X with a KD of 5×10−8 M or less, more preferably 1×10−8 M or less, more preferably 6×10−9 M or less, more preferably 3×10−9 M or less, even more preferably 2×10−9 M or less. The antibody can be chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human. The heavy chain constant region can be engineered to affect glycosylation type or extent, to extend antibody half-life, to enhance or reduce interactions with effector cells or the complement system, or to modulate some other property. The engineering can be accomplished by replacement, addition, or deletion of one or more amino acids or by replacement of a domain with a domain from another immunoglobulin type, or a combination of the foregoing.
“Antigen binding fragment” and “antigen binding portion” of an antibody (or simply “antibody portion” or “antibody fragment”) mean one or more fragments of an antibody that retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen. It has been shown that the antigen-binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a full-length antibody, such as (i) a Fab fragment, a monovalent fragment consisting of the VL, VH, CL and CH1 domains; (ii) a F(ab')2 fragment, a bivalent fragment comprising two Fab fragments linked by a disulfide bridge at the hinge region; (iii) a Fab' fragment, which is essentially an Fab with part of the hinge region (see, for example, Abbas et al., Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 6th Ed., Saunders Elsevier 2007); (iv) a Fd fragment consisting of the VH and CH1 domains; (v) a Fv fragment consisting of the VL and VH domains of a single arm of an antibody, (vi) a dAb fragment (Ward et al., (1989) Nature 341:544-546), which consists of a VH domain; (vii) an isolated complementarity determining region (CDR); and (viii) a nanobody, a heavy chain variable region containing a single variable domain and two constant domains. Preferred antigen binding fragments are Fab, F(ab')2, Fab', Fv, and Fd fragments. Furthermore, although the two domains of the Fv fragment, VL and VH, are encoded by separate genes, they can be joined, using recombinant methods, by a synthetic linker that enables them to be made as a single protein chain in which the VL and VH regions pair to form monovalent molecules (known as single chain Fv, or scFv); see, e.g., Bird et al. (1988) Science 242:423-426; and Huston et al. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:5879-5883). Such single chain antibodies are also encompassed within the term “antigen-binding portion” of an antibody.
An “isolated antibody” means an antibody that is substantially free of other antibodies having different antigenic specificities (e.g., an isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X is substantially free of antibodies that specifically bind antigens other than antigen X). An isolated antibody that specifically binds antigen X may, however, have cross-reactivity to other antigens, such as antigen X molecules from other species. In certain embodiments, an isolated antibody specifically binds to human antigen X and does not cross-react with other (non-human) antigen X antigens. Moreover, an isolated antibody may be substantially free of other cellular material and/or chemicals.
“Monoclonal antibody” or “monoclonal antibody composition” means a preparation of antibody molecules of single molecular composition, which displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope.
“Human antibody” means an antibody having variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions (and the constant region, if present) are derived from human germ-line immunoglobulin sequences. Human antibodies may include later modifications, including natural or synthetic modifications. Human antibodies may include amino acid residues not encoded by human germline immunoglobulin sequences (e.g., mutations introduced by random or site-specific mutagenesis in vitro or by somatic mutation in vivo). However, “human anti-body” does not include antibodies in which CDR sequences derived from the germline of another mammalian species, such as a mouse, have been grafted onto human framework sequences.
“Human monoclonal antibody” means an antibody displaying a single binding specificity, which has variable regions in which both the framework and CDR regions are derived from human germline immunoglobulin sequences. In one embodiment, human monoclonal antibodies are produced by a hybridoma that includes a B cell obtained from a transgenic nonhuman animal, e.g., a transgenic mouse, having a genome comprising a human heavy chain transgene and a light chain transgene fused to an immortalized cell.
“Aliphatic” means a straight- or branched-chain, saturated or unsaturated, non-aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having the specified number of carbon atoms (e.g., as in “C3 aliphatic,” “C1-5 aliphatic,” “C1-C5 aliphatic,” or “C1 to C5 aliphatic,” the latter three phrases being synonymous for an aliphatic moiety having from 1 to 5 carbon atoms) or, where the number of carbon atoms is not explicitly specified, from 1 to 4 carbon atoms (2 to 4 carbons in the instance of unsaturated aliphatic moieties). A similar understanding is applied to the number of carbons in other types, as in C2-4 alkene, C4-C7 cycloaliphatic, etc. In a similar vein, a term such as “(CH2)1-3” is to be understand as shorthand for the subscript being 1, 2, or 3, so that such term represents CH2, CH2CH2, and CH2CH2CH2.
“Alkyl” means a saturated aliphatic moiety, with the same convention for designating the number of carbon atoms being applicable. By way of illustration, C1-C4 alkyl moieties include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, and the like. “Alkylene” means a divalent counterpart of an alkyl group, such as CH2CH2, CH2CH2CH2, and CH2CH2CH2CH2.
“Alkenyl” means an aliphatic moiety having at least one carbon-carbon double bond, with the same convention for designating the number of carbon atoms being applicable. By way of illustration, C2-C4 alkenyl moieties include, but are not limited to, ethenyl (vinyl), 2-propenyl (allyl or prop-2-enyl), cis-1-propenyl, trans-1-propenyl, E- (or Z-) 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 1,3-butadienyl (but-1,3-dienyl) and the like.
“Alkynyl” means an aliphatic moiety having at least one carbon-carbon triple bond, with the same convention for designating the number of carbon atoms being applicable. By way of illustration, C2-C4 alkynyl groups include ethynyl (acetylenyl), propargyl (prop-2-ynyl), 1-propynyl, but-2-ynyl, and the like.
“Cycloaliphatic” means a saturated or unsaturated, non-aromatic hydrocarbon moiety having from 1 to 3 rings, each ring having from 3 to 8 (preferably from 3 to 6) carbon atoms. “Cycloalkyl” means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which each ring is saturated. “Cycloalkenyl” means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which at least one ring has at least one carbon-carbon double bond. “Cycloalkynyl” means a cycloaliphatic moiety in which at least one ring has at least one carbon-carbon triple bond. By way of illustration, cycloaliphatic moieties include, but are not limited to, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl, and adamantyl. Preferred cycloaliphatic moieties are cycloalkyl ones, especially cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, and cyclohexyl. “Cycloalkylene” means a divalent counterpart of a cycloalkyl group.
“Heterocycloaliphatic” means a cycloaliphatic moiety wherein, in at least one ring thereof, up to three (preferably 1 to 2) carbons have been replaced with a heteroatom independently selected from N, O, or S, where the N and S optionally may be oxidized and the N optionally may be quaternized. Preferred cycloaliphatic moieties consist of one ring, 5- to 6-membered in size. Similarly, “heterocycloalkyl,” “heterocycloalkenyl,” and “heterocycloalkynyl” means a cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, or cycloalkynyl moiety, respectively, in which at least one ring thereof has been so modified. Exemplary heterocycloaliphatic moieties include aziridinyl, azetidinyl, 1,3-dioxanyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuryl, pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, piperazinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl sulfone, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl sulfoxide, thiomorpholinyl sulfone, 1,3-dioxolanyl, tetrahydro-1,1-dioxothienyl, 1,4-dioxanyl, thietanyl, and the like. “Heterocycloalkylene” means a divalent counterpart of a heterocycloalkyl group.
“Alkoxy,” “aryloxy,” “alkylthio,” and “arylthio” mean -O(alkyl), -O(aryl), -S(alkyl), and -S(aryl), respectively. Examples are methoxy, phenoxy, methylthio, and phenylthio, respectively.
“Halogen” or “halo” means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, unless a narrower meaning is indicated.+
“Aryl” means a hydrocarbon moiety having a mono-, bi-, or tricyclic ring system (preferably monocyclic) wherein each ring has from 3 to 7 carbon atoms and at least one ring is aromatic. The rings in the ring system may be fused to each other (as in naphthyl) or bonded to each other (as in biphenyl) and may be fused or bonded to non-aromatic rings (as in indanyl or cyclohexylphenyl). By way of further illustration, aryl moieties include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, biphenyl, phenanthryl, anthracenyl, and acenaphthyl. “Arylene” means a divalent counterpart of an aryl group, for example 1,2-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene, or 1,4-phenylene.

Such at least one heteroatom containing aromatic ring may be fused to other types of rings (as in benzofuranyl or tetrahydroisoquinolyl) or directly bonded to other types of rings (as in phenylpyridyl or 2-cyclopentylpyridyl). By way of further illustration, heteroaryl moieties include pyrrolyl, furanyl, thiophenyl (thienyl), imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, N-oxopyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolynyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, quinozalinyl, naphthyridinyl, benzofuranyl, indolyl, benzothiophenyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, phenothiazolyl, benzimidazolyl, benzotriazolyl, dibenzofuranyl, carbazolyl, dibenzothiophenyl, acridinyl, and the like. “Heteroarylene” means a divalent counterpart of a heteroaryl group.
Where it is indicated that a moiety may be substituted, such as by use of “unsubstituted or substituted” or “optionally substituted” phrasing as in “unsubstituted or substituted C1-C5 alkyl” or “optionally substituted heteroaryl,” such moiety may have one or more independently selected substituents, preferably one to five in number, more preferably one or two in number. Substituents and substitution patterns can be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art, having regard for the moiety to which the substituent is attached, to provide compounds that are chemically stable and that can be synthesized by techniques known in the art as well as the methods set forth herein. Where a moiety is identified as being “unsubstituted or substituted” or “optionally substituted,” in a preferred embodiment such moiety is unsubstituted.
“Arylalkyl,” (heterocycloaliphatic)alkyl,” “arylalkenyl,” “arylalkynyl,” “biarylalkyl,” and the like mean an alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl moiety, as the case may be, substituted with an aryl, heterocycloaliphatic, biaryl, etc., moiety, as the case may be, with the open (unsatisfied) valence at the alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl moiety, for example as in benzyl, phenethyl, N-imidazoylethyl, N-morpholinoethyl, and the like. Conversely, “alkylaryl,” “alkenylcycloalkyl,” and the like mean an aryl, cycloalkyl, etc., moiety, as the case may be, substituted with an alkyl, alkenyl, etc., moiety, as the case may be, for example as in methylphenyl (tolyl) or allylcyclohexyl. “Hydroxyalkyl,” “haloalkyl,” “alkylaryl,” “cyanoaryl,” and the like mean an alkyl, aryl, etc., moiety, as the case may be, substituted with one or more of the identified substituent (hydroxyl, halo, etc., as the case may be).

Conjugates
General
Compounds disclosed herein can be used as therapeutic agents per se, but preferably are used as the drug component in conjugates. More preferably, the targeting moiety in the conjugate is an antibody or antigen binding portion thereof and its antigen is a tumor associated antigen, i.e., one that is expressed by a cancer cell. Preferably, the tumor associated antigen is uniquely expressed or overexpressed by the cancer cell, compared to a normal cell. The tumor associated antigen can be located on the surface of the cancer cell or secreted by the cancer cell into its environs.
In one aspect, there is provided a conjugate comprising compound of this invention and a ligand, represented by formula (II)
<in-line-formulae>[D(XD)a(C)c(XZ)b]mZ  (II)</in-line-formulae>
where Z is a targeting moiety, D is a compound of this invention, and -(XD)aC(XZ)b- are collectively referred to as a “linker moiety” or “linker” because they link Z and D. Within the linker, C is a cleavable group designed to be cleaved at or near the site of intended biological action of D; XD and XZ are spacer moieties (or “spacers”) that space apart D and C and C and Z, respectively; subscripts a, b, and c are independently 0 or 1 (that is, the presence of XD, XZ and C are optional). Subscript m is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 (preferably 1, 2, 3, or 4). D, XD, C, XZ and Z are more fully described hereinbelow.
By binding to a target tissue or cell where its antigen or receptor is located, Z directs the conjugate there. Cleavage of group C at the target tissue or cell releases D to exert its cytotoxic effect locally. In some instances, the conjugate is internalized into a target cell by endocytosis and cleavage takes place within the target cell. In this manner, precise delivery of D is achieved at the site of intended action, reducing the dosage needed. Also, D is normally biologically inactive (or significantly less active) in its conjugated state, thereby reducing undesired toxicity against non-target tissue or cells.
As reflected by the subscript m, each Z can conjugate with more than one D, depending on the number of sites Z has available for conjugation and the experimental conditions employed. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that, while each individual Z is conjugated to an integer number of Ds, a preparation of the conjugate may analyze for a non-integer ratio of D to Z, reflecting a statistical average. This ratio is referred to as the substitution ratio (“SR”) or the drug-antibody ratio (“DAR”).
Targeting Moiety Z
Preferably, targeting moiety Z is an antibody. For convenience and brevity and not by way of limitation, the detailed discussion in this specification about Z and its conjugates is written in the context of its being an antibody, but those skilled in the art will understand that other types of Z can be conjugated, mutatis mutandis. For example, conjugates with folic acid as the targeting moiety can target cells having the folate receptor on their surfaces (Leamon et al., Cancer Res. 2008, 68 (23), 9839). For the same reasons, the detailed discussion in this specification is primarily written in terms of a 1:1 ratio of Z to D (m=1).
Preferably, Z is an antibody against a tumor associated antigen, allowing the selective targeting of cancer cells. Examples of such antigens include: mesothelin, prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), CD19, CD22, CD30, CD70, B7H3, B7H4 (also known as O8E), protein tyrosine kinase 7 (PTK7), glypican-3, RG1, fucosyl-GM1, CTLA-4, and CD44. The antibody can be animal (e.g., murine), chimeric, humanized, or, preferably, human. The antibody preferably is monoclonal, especially a monoclonal human antibody. The preparation of human monoclonal antibodies against some of the aforementioned antigens is disclosed in Korman et al., U.S. Pat.

In addition to being an antibody, Z can also be an antibody fragment (such as Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, Fd, or Fv) or antibody mimetic, such as an affibody, a domain antibody (dAb), a nanobody, a unibody, a DARPin, an anticalin, a versabody, a duocalin, a lipocalin, or an avimer.
Any one of several different reactive groups on Z can be a conjugation site, including ε-amino groups in lysine residues, pendant carbohydrate moieties, carboxylic acid groups on aspartic or glutamic acid side chains, cysteine-cysteine disulfide groups, and cysteine thiol groups. For reviews on antibody reactive groups suitable for conjugation, see, e.g., Garnett, Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2001, 53, 171-216 and Dubowchik and Walker, Pharmacology & Therapeutics 1999, 83, 67-123, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Most antibodies have multiple lysine residues, which can be conjugated via their ε-amino groups via amide, urea, thiourea, or carbamate bonds.
In another embodiment, Z can be conjugated via a carbohydrate side chain, as many antibodies are glycosylated. The carbohydrate side chain can be oxidized with periodate to generate aldehyde groups, which in turn can be reacted with amines to form an imine group, such as in a semicarbazone, oxime, or hydrazone. If desired, the imine group can be converted to a more stable amine group by reduction with sodium cyanoborohydride. For additional disclosures on conjugation via carbohydrate side chains, see, e.g., Rodwell et al., Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 83, 2632-2636 (1986); the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
In another embodiment, Z can be conjugated via an aspartic or glutamic acid side chain carboxylic acid, for example by conversion to a carbohydrazide, which is then reacted with an aldehyde-bearing linker. See Fisch et al., Bioconjugate Chemistry 1992, 3, 147-153.
A thiol (-SH) group in the side chain of a cysteine can be used to form a conjugate by several methods. It can be used to form a disulfide bond between it and a thiol group on the linker. Another method is via its Michael addition to a maleimide group on the linker.
Typically, although antibodies have cysteine residues, they lack free thiol groups because all their cysteines are engaged in intra- or inter-chain disulfide bonds. To generate a free thiol group, a native disulfide group can be reduced. See, e.g., Packard et al., Biochemistry 1986, 25, 3548; King et al., Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 6176; and Doronina et al., Nature Biotechnol. 2003, 21, 778. Alternatively, a cysteine having a free -SH group can be introduced by mutating the antibody, substituting a cysteine for another amino acid or inserting one into the polypeptide chain. See, for example, Eigenbrot et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,521,541 B2 (2009); Chilkoti et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 1994, 5, 504; Urnovitz et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,698,420 (1987); Stimmel et al., J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 30445; Bam et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,311,902 B2 (2007); Kuan et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 7610; Poon et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1995, 270, 8571; Junutula et al., Nature Biotechnology 2008, 26, 925 and Rajpal et al., U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/270,245, filed Dec. 21, 2015. In yet another approach, a cysteine is added to the C-terminus of the heavy of light chain. See, e.g., Liu et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,865,875 B2 (2014); Cumber et al., J. Immunol. 1992, 149, 120; King et al, Cancer Res. 1994, 54, 6176; Li et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 2002, 13, 985; Yang et al., Protein Engineering 2003, 16, 761; and Olafson et al., Protein Engineering Design & Selection 2004, 17, 21. The disclosures of the documents cited in this paragraph are incorporated herein by reference.
Linkers and their Components
As noted above, the linker comprises up to three elements: a cleavable group C and optional spacers XZ and XD.
Group C is cleavable under physiological conditions. Preferably it is relatively stable while the conjugate is in circulation in the blood, but is readily cleaved once the conjugate reaches its site of intended action, near, at, or within the target cell. Preferably, the conjugate is internalized by a target cell upon binding of an antibody Z to an antigen displayed on the surface of the target cell. Subsequently, cleavage of C occurs in a vesicular body of the target cell (an early endosome, a late endosome, or, especially, a lysosome).
In one embodiment, C is a pH sensitive group. The pH in blood plasma is slightly above neutral, while the pH inside a lysosome is acidic, circa 5. Thus, an acid-sensitive C will cleave at a rate several orders of magnitude faster inside a lysosome than in blood. Examples of acid-sensitive groups are cis-aconityl amides and hydrazones, as described in Shen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,190 (1986); Shen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,144,011 (1992); Shen et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981, 102, 1048; and Yang et al., Proc. Natl Acad. Sci (USA) 1988, 85, 1189; the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
In another embodiment, C is a disulfide. Disulfides can be cleaved by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism, at a rate dependent on the ambient thiol concentration. As the intracellular concentration of glutathione and other thiols is higher than their serum concentrations, the cleavage rate of a disulfide will be higher intracellularly. Further, the rate of thiol-disulfide exchange can be modulated by adjustment of the steric and electronic characteristics of the disulfide (e.g., an alkyl-aryl disulfide versus an alkyl-alkyl disulfide; substitution on the aryl ring, etc.), enabling the design of disulfide linkages that have enhanced serum stability or a particular cleavage rate. See, e.g., Thorpe et al., Cancer Res. 2008, 48, 6396-6403; Santi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,541,530 B2 (2009); Ng et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,989,452 B2 (2006); Ng et al., WO 2002/096910 A1; Boyd et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,691,962 B2 (2010); and Sufi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,461,117 B2 (2013); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
A preferred group C is a peptide that is cleaved selectively by a protease inside the target cell, as opposed to by a protease in the serum. Typically, the peptide comprises from 1 to 20 amino acids, preferably from 1 to 6 amino acids, more preferably from 2 to 3 amino acids. The amino acid(s) can be natural and/or non-natural α-amino acids. Natural amino acids are those encoded by the genetic code, as well as amino acids derived therefrom, e.g., hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, citrulline, and O-phosphoserine. In this specification, the term “amino acid” also includes amino acid analogs and mimetics. Analogs are compounds having the same general H2N(R)CHCO2H structure of a natural amino acid, except that the R group is not one found among the natural amino acids. Examples of analogs include homoserine, norleucine, methionine-sulfoxide, and methionine methyl sulfonium. An amino acid mimetic is a compound that has a structure different from the general chemical structure of an α-amino acid but functions in a manner similar to one. The amino acid can be of the “L” stereochemistry of the genetically encoded amino acids, as well as of the enantiomeric “D” stereochemistry.
Preferably, C contains an amino acid sequence that is a cleavage recognition sequence for a protease. Many cleavage recognition sequences are known in the art. See, e.g., Matayoshi et al. Science 247: 954 (1990); Dunn et al. Meth. Enzymol. 241: 254 (1994); Seidah et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 175 (1994); Thornberry, Meth. Enzymol. 244: 615 (1994); Weber et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 595 (1994); Smith et al. Meth. Enzymol. 244: 412 (1994); and Bouvier et al. Meth. Enzymol. 248: 614 (1995); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
For conjugates that are not intended to be internalized by a cell, a group C can be chosen such that it is cleaved by a protease present in the extracellular matrix in the vicinity of a cancer, e.g., a protease released by nearby dying cancer cells or a tumor-associated protease secreted by cancer cells. Exemplary extracellular tumor-associated proteases are plasmin, matrix metalloproteases (MMP), thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and CD10. See, e.g., Trouet et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,402,556 B2 (2008); Dubois et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,425,541 B2 (2008); and Bebbington et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,897,034 B2 (2005).
For conjugates designed to be internalized by a cell, C preferably comprises an amino acid sequence selected for cleavage by an endosomal or lysosomal protease, especially the latter. Non-limiting examples of such proteases include cathepsins B, C, D, H, L and S, especially cathepsin B. Exemplary cathepsin B cleavable peptides include Val-Ala, Val-Cit, Val-Lys, Lys-Val-Ala, Asp-Val-Ala, Val-Ala, Lys-Val-Cit, Ala-Val-Cit, Val-Gly, Val-Gln, and Asp-Val-Cit. (Herein, amino acid sequences are written in the N-to-C direction, as in H2N-AA2-AA1-CO2H, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.) See Dubowchik et al., Biorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998, 8, 3341; Dubowchik et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998, 8, 3347; and Dubowchik et al., Bioconjugate Chem. 2002, 13, 855; the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference.
Another enzyme that can be utilized for cleaving peptidyl linkers is legumain, a lysosomal cysteine protease that preferentially cleaves at Ala-Ala-Asn.
In one embodiment, Group C is a peptide comprising a two-amino acid sequence -AA2-AA1- wherein AA1 is lysine, arginine, or citrulline and AA2 is phenylalanine, valine, alanine, leucine or isoleucine. In another embodiment, C consists of a sequence of one to three amino acids, selected from the group consisting of Val-Cit, Ala-Val, Val-Ala-Val, Lys-Lys, Ala-Asn-Val, Val-Leu-Lys, Cit-Cit, Val-Lys, Ala-Ala-Asn, Lys, Cit, Ser, and Glu. More preferably, it is a two to three amino acid peptide from the foregoing group.
The preparation and design of cleavable groups C consisting of a single amino acid is disclosed in Chen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,664,407 B2 (2014), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
Group C can be bonded directly to Z or D; i.e. spacers XZ or XD, as the case may be, can be absent.
When present, spacer XZ provides spatial separation between C and Z, lest the former sterically interfere with antigen binding by latter or the latter sterically interfere with cleavage of the former. Further, spacer XZ can be used to confer increased solubility or decreased aggregation properties to conjugates. A spacer XZ can comprise one or more modular segments, which can be assembled in any number of combinations. Examples of suitable segments for a spacer XZ are:
and combinations thereof,where the subscript g is 0 or 1 and the subscript h is 1 to 24, preferably 2 to 4. These segments can be combined, such as illustrated below:
Spacer XD, if present, provides spatial separation between C and D, lest the latter interfere sterically or electronically with cleavage of the former. Spacer XD also can serve to introduce additional molecular mass and chemical functionality into a conjugate. Generally, the additional mass and functionality will affect the serum half-life and other properties of the conjugate. Thus, through judicious selection of spacer groups, the serum half-live of a conjugate can be modulated. Spacer XD also can be assembled from modular segments, analogously to the description above for spacer XZ.
Spacers XZ and/or XD, where present, preferably provide a linear separation of from 4 to 25 atoms, more preferably from 4 to 20 atoms, between Z and C or D and C, respectively.
The linker can perform other functions in addition to covalently linking the antibody and the drug. For instance, the linker can contain a poly(ethylene glycol) (“PEG”) group. Since the conjugation step typically involves coupling a drug-linker to an antibody in an aqueous medium, a PEG group many enhance the aqueous solubility of the drug-linker. Also, a PEG group may enhance the solubility or reduce aggregation in the resulting ADC. Where a PEG group is present, it may be incorporated into either spacer XZ of XD, or both. The number of repeat units in a PEG group can be from 2 to 20, preferably between 4 and 10.
Either spacer XZ or XD, or both, can comprise a self-immolating moiety. A self-immolating moiety is a moiety that (1) is bonded to C and either Z or D and (2) has a structure such that cleavage from group C initiates a reaction sequence resulting in the self-immolating moiety disbonding itself from Z or D, as the case may be. In other words, reaction at a site distal from Z or D (cleavage from group C) causes the XZ-Z or the XD-D bond to rupture as well. The presence of a self-immolating moiety is desirable in the case of spacer XD because, if, after cleavage of the conjugate, spacer XD or a portion thereof were to remain attached to D, the biological activity of D may be impaired. The use of a self-immolating moiety is especially desirable where cleavable group C is a polypeptide, in which instance the self-immolating moiety typically is located adjacent thereto, in order to prevent D from sterically or electronically interfering with peptide cleavage.
Exemplary self-immolating moieties (i)-(v) bonded to a hydroxyl or amino group of D are shown below:
The self-immolating moiety is the structure between dotted lines a and b (or dotted lines b and c), with adjacent structural features shown to provide context. Self-immolating moieties (i) and (v) are bonded to a D-NH2 (i.e., conjugation is via an amino group), while self-immolating moieties (ii), (iii), and (iv) are bonded to a D-OH (i.e., conjugation is via a hydroxyl or carboxyl group). Cleavage of the bond at dotted line b by an enzyme-a peptidase in the instance of structures (i)-(v) and a β-glucuronidase in the instance of structure (vi)-initiates a self-immolating reaction sequence that results in the cleavage of the bond at dotted line a and the consequent release of D-OH or D-NH2, as the case may be. By way of illustration, self-immolating mechanisms for structures (i) and (iv) are shown below:
In other words, cleavage of a first chemical bond at one part of a self-immolating group initiates a sequence of steps that results in the cleavage of a second chemical bond-the one connecting the self-immolating group to the drug-at a different part of the self-immolating group, thereby releasing the drug.
In some instances, self-immolating groups can be used in tandem, as shown by structure (vii). In such case, cleavage at dotted line c triggers self-immolation of the moiety between dotted lines b and c by a 1,6-elimination reaction, followed by self-immolation of the moiety between dotted lines a and b by a cyclization-elimination reaction.

In another embodiment, Z and D are linked by a non-cleavable linker, i.e., C is absent. Metabolism of D eventually reduces the linker to a small appended moiety that does not interfere with the biological activity of D. Conjugation Techniques
Conjugates of compounds disclosed herein preferably are made by first preparing a compound comprising D and linker (XD)a(C)c(XZ)b (where XD, C, XZ, a, b, and c are as defined for formula (II)) to form drug-linker compound represented by formula (III):
<in-line-formulae>D-(XD)a(C)c(XZ)b-R31  (III)</in-line-formulae>
where R31 is a functional group suitable for reacting with a complementary functional group on Z to form the conjugate. Examples of suitable groups R31 include amino, azide, thiol, cyclooctyne,
where R32 is Cl, Br, F, mesylate, or tosylate and R33 is Cl, Br, I, F, OH, -O-N-succinimidyl, -O-(4-nitrophenyl), -O-pentafluorophenyl, or -O-tetrafluorophenyl. Chemistry generally usable for the preparation of suitable moieties D-(XD)aC(XZ)b-R31 is disclosed in Ng et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,087,600 B2 (2006); Ng et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,989,452 B2 (2006); Ng et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,129,261 B2 (2006); Ng et al., WO 02/096910 A1; Boyd et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,691,962 B2; Chen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,517,903 B2 (2009); Gangwar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,714,016 B2 (2010); Boyd et al., US 2008/0279868 A1; Gangwar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,847,105 B2 (2010); Gangwar et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,968,586 B2 (2011); Sufi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,461,117 B2 (2013); and Chen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,664,407 B2 (2014); the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.
Preferably reactive functional group -R31 is -NH2, -OH, -CO2H, -SH, maleimido, cyclooctyne, azido (-N3), hydroxylamino (-ONH2) or N-hydroxysuccinimido. Especially preferred functional groups -R31 are:
An -OH group can be esterified with a carboxy group on the antibody, for example, on an aspartic or glutamic acid side chain.
A -CO2H group can be esterified with a -OH group or amidated with an amino group (for example on a lysine side chain) on the antibody.
An N-hydroxysuccinimide group is functionally an activated carboxyl group and can conveniently be amidated by reaction with an amino group (e.g., from lysine).
A maleimide group can be conjugated with an -SH group on the antibody (e.g., from cysteine or from the chemical modification of the antibody to introduce a sulfhydryl functionality), in a Michael addition reaction.
Where an antibody does not have a cysteine -SH available for conjugation, an ε-amino group in the side chain of a lysine residue can be reacted with 2-iminothiolane or N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (“SPDP”) to introduce a free thiol (-SH) group-creating a cysteine surrogate, as it were. The thiol group can react with a maleimide or other nucleophile acceptor group to effect conjugation. The mechanism if illustrated below with 2-iminothiolane.
Typically, a thiolation level of two to three thiols per antibody is achieved. For a representative procedure, see Cong et al., U.S. Pat. No. 8,980,824 B2 (2015), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.
In a reversed arrangement, an antibody Z can be modified with N-succinimidyl 4-(maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexanecarboxylate (“SMCC”) or its sulfonated variant sulfo-SMCC, both of which are available from Sigma-Aldrich, to introduce a maleimide group thereto. Then, conjugation can be effected with a drug-linker compound having an -SH group on the linker.
An alternative conjugation method employs copper-free “click chemistry,” in which an azide group adds across a strained cyclooctyne to form an 1,2,3-triazole ring. See, e.g., Agard et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 15046; Best, Biochemistry 2009, 48, 6571, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. The azide can be located on the antibody and the cyclooctyne on the drug-linker moiety, or vice-versa. A preferred cyclooctyne group is dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO). Various reagents having a DIBO group are available from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg. The reaction below illustrates click chemistry conjugation for the instance in which the DIBO group is attached to the antibody (Ab):
Yet another conjugation technique involves introducing a non-natural amino acid into an antibody, with the non-natural amino acid providing a functionality for conjugation with a reactive functional group in the drug moiety. For instance, the non-natural amino acid p-acetylphenylalanine can be incorporated into an antibody or other polypeptide, as taught in Tian et al., WO 2008/030612 A2 (2008). The ketone group in p-acetylphenyalanine can be a conjugation site via the formation of an oxime with a hydroxylamino group on the linker-drug moiety. Alternatively, the non-natural amino acid p-azidophenylalanine can be incorporated into an antibody to provide an azide functional group for conjugation via click chemistry, as discussed above. Non-natural amino acids can also be incorporated into an antibody or other polypeptide using cell-free methods, as taught in Goerke et al., US 2010/0093024 A1 (2010) and Goerke et al., Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2009, 102 (2), 400-416. The foregoing disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. Thus, in one embodiment, an antibody that is used for making a conjugate has one or more amino acids replaced by a non-natural amino acid, which preferably is p-acetylphenylalanine or p-azidophenylalanine, more preferably p-acetylphenylalanine.
Still another conjugation technique uses the enzyme transglutaminase (preferably bacterial transglutaminase from Streptomyces mobaraensis or BTG), per Jeger et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, 49, 9995. BTG forms an amide bond between the side chain carboxamide of a glutamine (the amine acceptor) and an alkyleneamino group (the amine donor), which can be, for example, the ε-amino group of a lysine or a 5-amino-n-pentyl group. In a typical conjugation reaction, the glutamine residue is located on the antibody, while the alkyleneamino group is located on the linker-drug moiety, as shown below:
The positioning of a glutamine residue on a polypeptide chain has a large effect on its susceptibility to BTG mediated transamidation. None of the glutamine residues on an antibody are normally BTG substrates. However, if the antibody is deglycosylated-the glycosylation site being asparagine 297 (N297; numbering per EU index as set forth in Kabat et al., “Sequences of proteins of immunological interest,” 5th ed., Pub. No. 91-3242, U.S. Dept. Health & Human Services, NIH, Bethesda, Md., 1991; hereinafter “Kabat”) of the heavy chain-nearby glutamine 295 (Q295) is rendered BTG susceptible. An antibody can be deglycosylated enzymatically by treatment with PNGase F (Peptide-N-Glycosidase F). Alternatively, an antibody can be synthesized glycoside free by introducing an N297A mutation in the constant region, to eliminate the N297 glycosylation site. Further, it has been shown that an N297Q substitution not only eliminates glycosylation, but also introduces a second glutamine residue (at position 297) that too is an amine acceptor. Thus, in one embodiment, the antibody is deglycosylated. In another embodiment, the antibody has an N297Q substitution. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that deglycosylation by post-synthesis modification or by introducing an N297A mutation generates two BTG-reactive glutamine residues per antibody (one per heavy chain, at position 295), while an antibody with an N297Q substitution will have four BTG-reactive glutamine residues (two per heavy chain, at positions 295 and 297).
An antibody can also be rendered susceptible to BTG-mediated conjugation by introducing into it a glutamine containing peptide, or “tag,” as taught, for example, in Pons et al., US 2013/0230543 A1 (2013) and Rao-Naik et al., WO 2016/144608 A1.
In a complementary approach, the substrate specificity of BTG can be altered by varying its amino acid sequence, such that it becomes capable of reacting with glutamine 295 in an umodified antibody, as taught in Rao-Naik et al., PCT Application PCT/US2016/054585, filed 30 Sep. 2016.
While the most commonly available bacterial transglutaminase is that from S. mobaraensis, transglutaminase from other bacteria, having somewhat different substrate specificities, can be considered, such as transglutaminase from Streptoverticillium ladakanum (Hu et al., US 2009/0318349 A1 (2009), US 2010/0099610 A1 (2010), and US 2010/0087371 A1 (2010)).
Conjugation can also be effected using the enzyme Sortase A, as taught in Levary et al., PLoS One 2011, 6(4), e18342; Proft, Biotechnol. Lett. 2010, 32, 1-10; Ploegh et al., WO 2010/087994 A2 (2010); and Mao et al., WO 2005/051976 A2 (2005). The Sortase A recognition motif (typically LPXTG, where X is any natural amino acid) may be located on the ligand Z and the nucleophilic acceptor motif (typically GGG) may be the group R31 in formula (III), or vice-versa.
Drug-Linker Compounds
Generally, an ADC comprises a linker attached to a functional group on the drug, which linker is attached in turn to the antibody. Reflecting the diversity of conjugation techniques available, the drugs can be elaborated into many different drug-linker compounds suitable for conjugation to an antibody.
There are three different positions ((a), (b), and (c)) for attachment of the linker to compounds disclosed herein, as illustrated below (with variables and optional substituents not shown for simplicity):
Linker attachment at position (a) entails forming an addition product (A) across the imine double bond, comprising a carbamate group. Cleavage of the linker at the dotted line leads to intermediate (B), whose unstable carbamic acid group decarboxylates to produce a geminal amino alcohol (C). Dehydration of the latter regenerates the benzodiazepine ring system (D).
For conjugation at position (b), a suitable functional group such as amino (NH2) or hydroxyl (OH) can be situated at the flanking benzene ring.
For conjugation at position (c), a suitable functional group such as amino (NH2) or hydroxyl (OH) can be situated at Ar1 or W, preferable at W.
Thus, there is provided a drug-linker compound having a structure represented by formula (IIIa, (IIIb), or (IIIc)

Example 1-Conjugation by Michael Addition
This general procedure is based on introduction of free thiol groups into an antibody by reaction of lysine ε-amino groups with 2-iminothiolane, followed by reaction with a maleimide-containing drug-linker moiety, such as described above. Initially the antibody is buffer exchanged into 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 50 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTPA and concentrated to 5-10 mg/mL. Thiolation is achieved through addition of 2-imino-thiolane to the antibody. The amount of 2-iminothiolane to be added can be determined by a preliminary experiment and varies from antibody to antibody. In the preliminary experiment, a titration of increasing amounts of 2-iminothiolane is added to the antibody, and following incubation with the antibody for 1 h at room temperature (“RT,” circa 25° C.), the antibody is desalted into 50 mM HEPES, 5 mM Glycine, 2 mM DTPA, pH 5.5 using a SEPHADEX™ G-25 column and the number of thiol groups introduced determined rapidly by reaction with DTDP. Reaction of thiol groups with DTDP results in liberation of thiopyridine, which can be monitored spectroscopically at 324 nm. Samples at a protein concentration of 0.5-1.0 mg/mL are typically used. The absorbance at 280 nm can be used to accurately determine the concentration of protein in the samples, and then an aliquot of each sample (0.9 mL) is incubated with 0.1 mL DTDP (5 mM stock solution in ethanol) for 10 min at RT. Blank samples of buffer alone plus DTDP are also incubated alongside. After 10 min, absorbance at 324 nm is measured and the number of thiol groups is quantitated using an extinction coefficient for thiopyridine of 19,800 M−1.
Typically a thiolation level of about two to three thiol groups per antibody is desirable. For example, with some antibodies this can be achieved by adding a 15-fold molar excess of 2-iminothiolane followed by incubation at RT for 1 h. The antibody is then incubated with 2-iminothiolane at the desired molar ratio and then desalted into conjugation buffer (50 mM HEPES, 5 mM glycine, 2 mM DTPA, pH 5.5)). The thiolated material is maintained on ice while the number of thiols introduced is quantitated as described above.
After verification of the number of thiols introduced, the drug-linker moiety is added at a 2.5-fold molar excess per thiol. The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed in conjugation buffer containing a final concentration of 25% propylene glycol and 5% trehalose. Commonly, the drug-linker stock solution is dissolved in 100% DMSO. The stock solution is added directly to the thiolated antibody.
The conjugation reaction mixture is incubated at RT for 2 h with gentle stirring. A 10-fold molar excess of N-ethyl maleimide (100 mM Stock in DMSO) is then added to the conjugation mixture and stirred for an additional hour to block any unreacted thiols. The sample is then filtered via a 0.2μ filter The material is buffer exchanged via TFF VivaFlow 50 Sartorius 30 MWCO PES membrane into 10 mg/mL glycine, 20 mg/mL sorbitol, 15% acetonitrile, pH 5.0 (5×TFF buffer exchange volume), to remove any unreacted drug. The final formulation is carried out by TFF into 20 mg/mL sorbitol, 10 mg/mL glycine, pH 5.0.
Example 2-Transglutaminase-Mediated Conjugation
The following procedure can be used for transglutaminase mediated conjugation of drug-linker compounds wherein the linker has an amine group that can act as an amine donor. The antibody can be one that has a transglutaminase-reactive glutamine, for example one with an N297A or N297Q substitution. Conjugation is carried out by recombinant bacterial transglutaminase with a molar ratio of antibody:enzyme of 5:1. The conjugation is carried out using standard protocols in 50 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, incubated overnight at 37° C. The resulting conjugate is purified on a Protein A column, pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0. The conjugate is eluted with 0.1 M sodium citrate buffer, pH 3.5. The eluted fractions are neutralized with 1M Tris pH 9.0. The conjugated can be formulated in 20 mg/mL Sorbitol, 10 mg/mL Glycine, pH 5.0.
Those skilled in the art will understand that the conditions and methodologies in these two examples are illustrative and non-limiting and that variations thereof or other approaches for conjugation are known in the art and usable in the present invention.
