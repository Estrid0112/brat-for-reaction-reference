BACKGROUND
Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to compounds capable of modulating the mu-opioid receptor (“MOR”), the delta-opioid receptor (“DOR”), and/or the kappa-opioid receptor (“KOR”), and methods of using these receptor modulators for the treatment of pain.
Description of Related Technology
Opioid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors found in the brain, spinal cord, and digestive tract that have a wide variety of biological function, including controlling pain sensation. There are three recognized “classical” opioid receptor subtypes: mu-opioid receptors (MOR), delta-opioid receptors (DOR), and kappa-opioid receptors (KOR). The natural ligands for opioid receptors include enkephalins, endorphins, endomorphins, and dynorphins, and an abundance of non-peptide or synthetic ligands have been discovered or developed to modulate opioid receptor activity.
Opioid drugs, including morphine, are the primary treatment for severe pain, e.g., post-operative and chronic pain conditions. Unfortunately, the use of opioids can lead to the development of a number of undesirable side effects, such as nausea, pruritis, sedation, mood swings, respiratory depression, constipation, and perhaps most problematically, dependence/addiction and tolerance. (Benyamin, R. et al. Pain Physician 2008; 11:S105-S120).
Despite a considerable amount of research into opioid-based therapeutics, there remains a need for analgesics that exhibit little or none of the adverse effects associated with traditional opioid use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION
Provided herein are peptidomimetic compounds that can act as mu-opioid receptor (“MOR”) agonists, delta-opioid receptor (“DOR”) antagonists, or as dual mu-opioid receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist (“MOR agonist/DOR antagonist”) agents. These modulators can be used as analgesics to treat pain, and are advantageous for pain management over traditional opioids because they exhibit decreased or no side effects. These compounds can also act as kappa-opioid receptor (“KOR”) modulators, either exclusively or simultaneously with MOR modulator activity. Such dual modulators can be used to treat cocaine or opioid abuse. The compound disclosed herein also can act as DOR/KOR dual modulators and MOR/DOR/KOR triplet modulators.
There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that the DOR plays a significant role in the modulation of the side effects related to the chronic use of opioid analgesics. Although the analgesic effects of traditional opioid agents such as morphine are associated with stimulation of the MOR, the coadministration of DOR antagonists has been shown to maintain the desired antinociceptive activity but with a reduced side-effect profile compared with a MOR agonist alone (Hepburn, M. J. et al. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1997, 281:1350-1356; Abdelhamid, E. E. et al. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1991, 258:299-303; Kest, B. et al. Brain Res. Bull. 1996, 39:185-188; Zhu, Y. et al. Neuron 1999, 24:243-252). Because the compounds disclosed herein target both the MOR and DOR, they advantageously provide pain relief without the side effects associated with traditional opioids. Additionally, such compounds with reduced affinity and efficacy at the KOR can treat pain while limiting hallucinogenic, dissociative, and/or stress-related side effects. Dual MOR/KOR modulators can be used to treat cocaine abuse and as antidotes for opioid overdose.
The compounds described herein have a structure of Formula (I):

wherein the substituents are as described in detail below.
Definitions
As used herein, the term “alkyl” refers to straight chained and branched saturated hydrocarbon groups containing one to thirty carbon atoms, for example, one to twenty carbon atoms, or one to ten carbon atoms. The term Cn means the alkyl group has “n” carbon atoms. For example, C4 alkyl refers to an alkyl group that has 4 carbon atoms. C1-C7 alkyl refers to an alkyl group having a number of carbon atoms encompassing the entire range (e.g., 1 to 7 carbon atoms), as well as all subgroups (e.g., 1-6, 2-7, 1-5, 3-6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 carbon atoms). Nonlimiting examples of alkyl groups include, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl (2-methylpropyl), t-butyl (1,1-dimethylethyl), 3,3-dimethylpentyl, and 2-ethylhexyl. Unless otherwise indicated, an alkyl group can be an unsubstituted alkyl group or a substituted alkyl group.
The term “alkylene” used herein refers to an alkyl group having a substituent. For example, the term “alkylenearyl” refers to an alkyl group substituted with an aryl group. For example, an alkylene group can be -CH2CH2- or -CH2-. The term Cn means the alkylene group has “n” carbon atoms. For example, C1-6 alkylene refers to an alkylene group having a number of carbon atoms encompassing the entire range, as well as all subgroups, as previously described for “alkyl” groups. The terms “alkyloxy” and “alkylenearyloxy” refer to an alkyl group or alkylenearyl group substituted with an oxygen, respectively. Unless otherwise indicated, an alkylene group can be an unsubstituted alkylene group or a substituted alkylene group.
As used herein, the term “cycloalkyl” refers to an aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbon group containing three to eight carbon atoms (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 carbon atoms). The term Cn means the cycloalkyl group has “n” carbon atoms. For example, C5 cycloalkyl refers to a cycloalkyl group that has 5 carbon atoms in the ring. C5-C8 cycloalkyl refers to cycloalkyl groups having a number of carbon atoms encompassing the entire range (e.g., 5 to 8 carbon atoms), as well as all subgroups (e.g., 5-6, 6-8, 7-8, 5-7, 5, 6, 7, and 8 carbon atoms). Nonlimiting examples of cycloalkyl groups include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, and cyclooctyl. Unless otherwise indicated, a cycloalkyl group can be an unsubstituted cycloalkyl group or a substituted cycloalkyl group. The cycloalkyl groups described herein can be isolated or fused to another cycloalkyl group, a heterocycloalkyl group, an aryl group and/or a heteroaryl group. When a cycloalkyl group is fused to another cycloalkyl group, then each of the cycloalkyl groups can contain three to eight carbon atoms.
As used herein, the term “heterocycloalkyl” is defined similarly as cycloalkyl, except the ring contains one to three heteroatoms independently selected from oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. In particular, the term “heterocycloalkyl” refers to a ring containing a total of three to eight atoms, of which 1, 2, 3 or three of those atoms are heteroatoms independently selected from the group consisting of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur, and the remaining atoms in the ring are carbon atoms. Nonlimiting examples of heterocycloalkyl groups include piperdine, pyrazolidine, tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran, dihydrofuran, morpholine, and the like. Cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl groups can be saturated or partially unsaturated ring systems optionally substituted with, for example, one to three groups, independently selected alkyl, alkyleneOH, C(O)NH2, NH2, oxo (═O), aryl, haloalkyl, halo, and OH. Heterocycloalkyl groups optionally can be further N-substituted with alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, alkylenearyl, and alkyleneheteroaryl. The heterocycloalkyl groups described herein can be isolated or fused to another heterocycloalkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group, and/or a heteroaryl group. When a heterocycloalkyl group is fused to another heterocycloalkyl group, then each of the heterocycloalkyl groups can contain three to eight total ring atoms, and one to three heteroatoms.
As used herein, the term “aryl” refers to a monocyclic aromatic group, such as phenyl. Unless otherwise indicated, an aryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more, and in particular one to four groups independently selected from, for example, halo, alkyl, alkenyl, OCF3, NO2, CN, NC, OH, alkoxy, amino, CO2H, CO2alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl. Aryl groups can be isolated (e.g., phenyl) or fused to another aryl group (e.g., naphthyl, anthracenyl), a cycloalkyl group (e.g. tetraydronaphthyl), a heterocycloalkyl group, and/or a heteroaryl group. Exemplary aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl, tetrahydronaphthyl, chlorophenyl, methylphenyl, methoxyphenyl, trifluoromethylphenyl, nitrophenyl, 2,4-methoxychlorophenyl, and the like. Throughout, the abbreviation “Ph” refers to phenyl and “Bn” refers to benzyl (i.e., CH2phenyl).
As used herein, the term “heteroaryl” refers to a monocyclic aromatic ring having five or six total ring atoms, and containing one to three heteroatoms selected from nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atom in the aromatic ring. Unless otherwise indicated, a heteroaryl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more, and in particular one to four, substituents selected from, for example, halo, alkyl, alkenyl, OCF3, NO2, ON, NC, OH, alkoxy, amino, CO2H, CO2alkyl, aryl, and heteroaryl. In some cases, the heteroaryl group is substituted with one or more of alkyl and alkoxy groups. Heteroaryl groups can be isolated (e.g., pyridyl) or fused to another heteroaryl group (e.g., purinyl), a cycloalkyl group (e.g., tetrahydroquinolinyl), a heterocycloalkyl group (e.g., dihydronaphthyridinyl), and/or an aryl group (e.g., benzothiazolyl and quinolyl). Examples of heteroaryl groups include, but are not limited to, thienyl, furyl, pyridyl, pyrrolyl, oxazolyl, quinolyl, thiophenyl, isoquinolyl, indolyl, triazinyl, triazolyl, isothiazolyl, isoxazolyl, imidazolyl, benzothiazolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, thiazolyl, and thiadiazolyl. When a heteroaryl group is fused to another heteroaryl group, then each heteroaryl group can contain five or six total atoms and one to three heteroatoms in its aromatic ring.
As used herein, the term “alkoxy” or “alkoxyl” as used herein refers to a “-O-alkyl” group. The alkoxy or alkoxyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted.
As used herein, the term “substituted,” when used to modify a chemical functional group, refers to the replacement of at least one hydrogen radical on the functional group with a substituent. Substituents can include, but are not limited to, alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl, alkynyl, heterocycloalkyl, ether, polyether, thioether, polythioether, aryl, heteroaryl, hydroxyl, oxy, alkoxy, heteroalkoxy, aryloxy, heteroaryloxy, ester, thioester, carboxy, cyano, nitro, amino, amido, acetamide, and halo (e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo). When a chemical functional group includes more than one substituent, the substituents can be bound to the same carbon atom or to two or more different carbon atoms. A substituted chemical functional group can itself include one or more substituents.
As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount of a compound or combination of therapeutically active compounds (e.g., an opioid receptor modulator or combination of opioid receptor modulators) that ameliorates, attenuates or eliminates one or more symptoms of a particular disease or condition (e.g., heart disease), or prevents or delays the onset of one of more symptoms of a particular disease or condition.
As used herein, the terms “patient” and “subject” may be used interchangeably and mean animals, such as dogs, cats, cows, horses, and sheep (e.g., non-human animals) and humans. Particular patients or subjects are mammals (e.g., humans). The terms patient and subject includes males and females.
As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means that the referenced substance, such as a compound of the present disclosure, or a formulation containing the compound, or a particular excipient, are safe and suitable for administration to a patient or subject. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to a medium that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s) and is not toxic to the host to which it is administered.
As used herein the terms “treating”, “treat” or “treatment” and the like include preventative (e.g., prophylactic) and palliative treatment.
As used herein, the term “excipient” means any pharmaceutically acceptable additive, carrier, diluent, adjuvant, or other ingredient, other than the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).

Synthesis of compounds of Formula (I)
The compounds disclosed herein can be prepared in a variety of ways using commercially available starting materials, compounds known in the literature, or from readily prepared intermediates, by employing standard synthetic methods and procedures either known to those skilled in the art, or in light of the teachings herein. Standard synthetic methods and procedures for the preparation of organic molecules and functional group transformations and manipulations can be obtained from the relevant scientific literature or from standard textbooks in the field. Although not limited to any one or several sources, classic texts such as Smith, M. B., March, J., March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, 5th edition, John Wiley & Sons: New York, 2001 and Greene, T.W., Wuts, P.G. M., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons: New York, 1999, are useful and recognized reference textbooks of organic synthesis known to those in the art. For example, the compounds disclosed herein can be synthesized by solid phase synthesis techniques including those described in Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85:2149; Davis et al., Biochem. Intl. 1985; 10:394-414; Larsen et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115:6247; Smith et al., J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 44: 183; O'Donnell et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118:6070; Stewart and Young, Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis, Freeman (1969); Finn et al., The Proteins, 3rd ed., vol. 2, pp. 105-253 (1976); and Erickson et al., The Proteins, 3rd ed., vol. 2, pp. 257-527 (1976). The following descriptions of synthetic methods are designed to illustrate, but not to limit, general procedures for the preparation of compounds of the present disclosure.
The synthetic processes disclosed herein can tolerate a wide variety of functional groups; therefore, various substituted starting materials can be used. The processes generally provide the desired final compound at or near the end of the overall process, although it may be desirable in certain instances to further convert the compound to a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug thereof.
In general, the compounds of Formula (I) can be synthesized according to Scheme 1.
<img> id-US20180072677A1-20180315-C00094.TIF </img>
Amines 9 can be synthesized using the procedure shown in Scheme 1. Acylation of substituted anilines 4 with an optionally substituted acyl chloride produces 5. Subsequent intramolecular cyclization and acid-catalyzed ring expansion gives ketones 6. Reductive amination via oxime intermediates 7 produces amines 8. Optional alkylation of the aliphatic amine, optionally followed by acylation or alkylation of the aromatic amine, can produce 9, which can be coupled with 3 to produce compounds as described herein. For this and all other synthetic schemes in this application, X is defined as any suitable leaving group, for example, Cl, Br, I, OTf, or OMs.
Amino acids 3 can be synthesized using procedures such as the one shown in Scheme 2.
<img> id-US20180072677A1-20180315-C00095.TIF </img>
Protected, halogenated amino esters 1 may be cross-coupled, with a metal catalyst and optionally a ligand, to halogenated, substituted aryl groups 2 and subsequently hydrolyzed to produce amino acids 3.
Specific stereoisomers of compound 8 (designated 8') can be obtained as shown in Scheme 3.
<img> id-US20180072677A1-20180315-C00096.TIF </img>
Scheme 3 provides two different pathways for obtaining compound 8'. In the first pathway, compound 6 is treated with tert-butanesulfinamide to produce 10. Reduction and deprotection of 10 gives 8'. In the second pathway, ketone 6 can be asymmetrically reduced using a chiral reducing agent, such as CBS oxazaborolidine, to provide chiral alcohol 11. Alcohol 11 can then be converted to the desired amino group using phthalimide under Mitsunobu conditions. Subsequent deprotection provides 8'. Compound 8' may then be processed in a manner similar to 8 to obtain compounds as described herein.
In some cases, compounds of Formula (I) can be synthesized according to Scheme 4
<img> id-US20180072677A1-20180315-C00097.TIF </img>
Commercially available bromide 12 can be treated with tert-butylsulfinamide to produce 13. Reduction and subsequent cross-coupling can produce compound 14. In this scheme, M can be any metal or metalloid that is suitable for cross-coupling, e.g., B(OH)2, SnBu3, ZnBr, or SiEt3. Deprotection of the aliphatic amine followed by optional alkylation furnishes 15. Amide coupling with 3 can produce compounds as disclosed herein.
Additional synthetic procedures for preparing the compounds disclosed herein can be found in the Examples section.
Pharmaceutical Formulations, Dosing, and Routes of Administration
Further provided are pharmaceutical formulations comprising a compound as described herein (e.g., compounds of Formula (I), or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.
The compounds described herein can be administered to a subject in a therapeutically effective amount (e.g., in an amount sufficient to induce analgesia, meaning to reduce, ease, suppress, or alleviate pain). The compounds can be administered alone or as part of a pharmaceutically acceptable composition or formulation. In addition, the compounds can be administered all at once, multiple times, or delivered substantially uniformly over a period of time. It is also noted that the dose of the compound can be varied over time.
A particular administration regimen for a particular subject will depend, in part, upon the compound, the amount of compound administered, the route of administration, and the cause and extent of any side effects. The amount of compound administered to a subject (e.g., a mammal, such as a human) in accordance with the disclosure should be sufficient to effect the desired response over a reasonable time frame. Dosage typically depends upon the route, timing, and frequency of administration. Accordingly, the clinician titers the dosage and modifies the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect, and conventional range-finding techniques are known to those of ordinary skill in the art.
Purely by way of illustration, the method comprises administering, e.g., from about 0.1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg of compound or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage ranges from 1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 10 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg. Some conditions require prolonged treatment, which may or may not entail administering lower doses of compound over multiple administrations. If desired, a dose of the compound is administered as two, three, four, five, six or more sub-doses administered separately at appropriate intervals throughout the day, optionally, in unit dosage forms. The treatment period will depend on the particular condition and type of pain, and may last one day to several months.
Suitable methods of administering a physiologically-acceptable composition, such as a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compounds disclosed herein (e.g., compounds of Formula (I)), are well known in the art. Although more than one route can be used to administer a compound, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. Depending on the circumstances, a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound is applied or instilled into body cavities, absorbed through the skin or mucous membranes, ingested, inhaled, and/or introduced into circulation. For example, in certain circumstances, it will be desirable to deliver a pharmaceutical composition comprising the agent orally, through injection by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal), intracerebroventricular, intramuscular, intra-ocular, intraarterial, intraportal, intralesional, intramedullary, intrathecal, intraventricular, transdermal, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intranasal, enteral, topical, sublingual, urethral, vaginal, or rectal means, by sustained release systems, or by implantation devices. If desired, the compound is administered regionally via intrathecal administration, intracerebral (intra-parenchymal) administration, intracerebroventricular administration, or intraarterial or intravenous administration feeding the region of interest. Alternatively, the composition is administered locally via implantation of a membrane, sponge, or another appropriate material onto which the desired compound has been absorbed or encapsulated. Where an implantation device is used, the device is, in one aspect, implanted into any suitable tissue or organ, and delivery of the desired compound is, for example, via diffusion, timed-release bolus, or continuous administration.
To facilitate administration, the compound is, in various aspects, formulated into a physiologically-acceptable composition comprising a carrier (e.g., vehicle, adjuvant, or diluent). The particular carrier employed is limited only by chemico-physical considerations, such as solubility and lack of reactivity with the compound, and by the route of administration. Physiologically-acceptable carriers are well known in the art. Illustrative pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions (for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,466,468). Injectable formulations are further described in, e.g., Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J. B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia. Pa., Banker and Chalmers, eds., pages 238-250 (1982), and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., pages 622-630 (1986)). A pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound is, in one aspect, placed within containers, along with packaging material that provides instructions regarding the use of such pharmaceutical compositions. Generally, such instructions include a tangible expression describing the reagent concentration, as well as, in certain embodiments, relative amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents (e.g., water, saline or PBS) that may be necessary to reconstitute the pharmaceutical composition.
Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions, or emulsions, and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents, or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate. Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.
These compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting, emulsifying, and dispersing agents. Microorganism contamination can be prevented by adding various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged absorption of injectable pharmaceutical compositions can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is admixed with at least one inert customary excipient (or carrier) such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate or (a) fillers or extenders, as for example, starches, lactose, sucrose, mannitol, and silicic acid; (b) binders, as for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, and acacia; (c) humectants, as for example, glycerol; (d) disintegrating agents, as for example, agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain complex silicates, and sodium carbonate; (a) solution retarders, as for example, paraffin; (f) absorption accelerators, as for example, quaternary ammonium compounds; (g) wetting agents, as for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; (h) adsorbents, as for example, kaolin and bentonite; and (i) lubricants, as for example, talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, or mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, and tablets, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be used as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols, and the like.
Solid dosage forms such as tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells, such as enteric coatings and others well known in the art. The solid dosage forms may also contain opacifying agents. Further, the solid dosage forms may be embedding compositions, such that they release the active compound or compounds in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used are polymeric substances and waxes. The active compound can also be in micro-encapsulated form, optionally with one or more excipients.
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups, and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage form may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art, such as water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, as for example, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils, in particular, cottonseed oil, groundnut oil, corn germ oil, olive oil, castor oil, and sesame seed oil, glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.
Besides such inert diluents, the composition can also include adjuvants, such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents. Suspensions, in addition to the active compound, may contain suspending agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, and tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.
Compositions for rectal administration are preferably suppositories, which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of the disclosure with suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax, which are solid at ordinary room temperature, but liquid at body temperature, and therefore, melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active component.
When appropriate, the compound is administered in combination with other substances (e.g., therapeutics) and/or other therapeutic modalities to achieve an additional (or augmented) biological effect. These other therapeutics/co-treatments include, for example, surgery, radiation treatment, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic factors (for instance, soluble growth factor receptors (e.g., sflt), growth factor antagonists (e.g., angiotensin), etc.), antibiotics, hormone therapy, anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or steroidal anti-inflammatory substances), antiviral agents, anti-bacterial agents, cough suppressant, decongestant, or expectorant, pain relievers, and the like. Optionally, the compound is administered in combination with an agent that facilitates transport across the blood-brain barrier and/or an agent that blocks efflux from the brain. Additional combination therapies not specifically listed herein are also within the scope of the present disclosure.
The disclosure thus includes administering to a subject the compound in combination with one or more additionally suitable substances(s), each being administered according to a regimen suitable for that medicament. This aspect includes concurrent administration (e.g., substantially simultaneous administration) and non-concurrent administration (e.g., administration at different times, in any order, whether overlapping or not) of the agent and one or more additionally suitable agents(s). It will be appreciated that different components are, in certain aspects, administered in the same or in separate compositions, and by the same or different routes of administration.
In jurisdictions that forbid the patenting of methods that are practiced on the human body, the meaning of “administering” of a composition to a human subject shall be restricted to prescribing a controlled substance that a human subject will self-administer by any technique (e.g., orally, inhalation, topical application, injection, insertion, etc.). The broadest reasonable interpretation that is consistent with laws or regulations defining patentable subject matter is intended. In jurisdictions that do not forbid the patenting of methods that are practiced on the human body, the “administering” of compositions includes both methods practiced on the human body and also the foregoing activities.
Methods of Use
The compounds described herein (e.g., the compounds of Formula (I)) can act as opioid receptor modulators. In some embodiments, the compounds are MOR agonists, e.g., the compounds trigger or upregulate MOR-mediated biological activity, such as analgesia. In various embodiments, the compounds are DOR antagonists, e.g., the compounds inhibit or prevent one or more of DOR's biological activities (such as development of dependence, gastrointestinal motility, or cardiovascular regulation) in response to a DOR agonist. The compounds also can act as dual opioid receptor modulators, which are able to bind MOR and DOR, optionally demonstrating substantially equivalent binding affinity for both receptors. In various embodiments, the compounds are KOR agonists. In some cases, the compounds are KOR antagonists. In some embodiments, the compounds modulate one or more of KOR's biological activities, such as depression, anxiety, analgesia, tolerance, dysphoria, and memory regulation. The compounds can also act as dual MOR/KOR modulators, dual DOR/KOR modulators, or MOR/DOR/KOR triplet modulators.
The compounds disclosed herein are particularly advantageous for the treatment of pain requiring long term administration of opioid receptor agonists, which is connected to an increased risk of adverse side effects. The incidence and/or intensity of adverse side effects associated with opioid use are attenuated with use of the compounds compared to monofunctional opioids, such as morphine. Examples of adverse excitatory effects include, without limitation, physical or psychological dependence, psychological dependence, tolerance, constipation, nausea, respiratory depression, sedation, and vomiting. Physical dependence is marked by physiologic adaptation to a drug that may ultimately lead to withdrawal symptoms when the drug is discontinued. “Tolerance” refers to circumstances where dosage must be increased in order to maintain the physiological response to the agonist achieved at the beginning of treatment.
In some cases, the compounds described herein target the MOR with an EC50 in a range of about 0.1 to 3000 nM, 0.1 to 1000 nM, 0.1 to 500 nM, 0.1 to 100 nM, 0.1 to 50 nM, 0.1 to 25 nM, 0.1 to 10 nM, 0.1 to 5 nM, 0.1 to 1 nM, 0.1 to 0.5 nM, 1000 to 2000 nM, 100 to 1000 nM, 10 or 100 nM, 5 to 50 nM, or 1 to 10 nM. These compounds can also target the DOR with an EC50 of at least 10 nM, or at least 20 nM, or at least 50 nM, or at least 100 nM, or in a range of about 10 to 1000 nM, 20 to 1000 nM, 50 to 1000 nM, 100 to 1000 nM, or 200 to 1000 nM. These compounds can also bind to, but not stimulate, DOR (e.g., act as an antagonist). These compounds can also target the KOR with an EC50 of 5 to 3000 nM, 5 to 1000 nM, 5 to 500 nM, or 5 to 100 nM. When the compounds disclosed herein are dual modulators, their binding affinities can optionally be “substantially equivalent” (e.g., differing by no more than 10-fold or no more than 5-fold)” ”. The compounds also, in various embodiments, can selectively bind MOR and DOR, exhibiting decreased affinity for kappa-opioid receptor (KOR). In this regard, the compounds optionally bind MOR and DOR with a binding affinity at least 100 times (e.g., at least 250 times, at least 300 times, at least 400 times, or at least 500 times) greater than the compound binds KOR.
Thus, provided herein is a method of modulating MOR, DOR, and/or KOR, in a cell, comprising contacting the cell with a compound or a composition as disclosed herein (e.g., the compounds of formula (I) in an amount sufficient to modulate MOR, DOR, and/or KOR. In some embodiments, the MOR is modulated alone. In various embodiments, the DOR is modulated alone. In some cases, the KOR is modulated alone. In various cases, the MOR and DOR are modulated simultaneously. In some embodiments, the MOR and KOR are modulated simultaneously. In some cases, the DOR and KOR are modulated simultaneously. In various cases, the MOR, DOR, and KOR are modulated simultaneously. The contacting of the cell can occur in vitro or in vivo. In some cases, contacting of the cell occurs in vitro. In other cases, contacting of the cell occurs in vivo. The compounds described herein can contact a cell in vivo by administering a compound described herein to a subject in need of MOR and/or DOR modulation. Therefore, the disclosure includes administering one or more of a compound described herein to a subject, such as a human, in need thereof. In some embodiments, the subject suffers from pain. The pain can be associated with a disorder of the MOR, DOR, and/or KOR. Disorders associated with MOR include, but are not limited to, pain and gastrointestinal motility disorders (e.g., constipation and irritable bowel syndrome). Disorders associated with DOR include, but are not limited to, seizures and depression. Disorders associated with KOR include, but are not limited to, cocaine dependence. See, e.g., Jutkiewicz et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 317(3): 1337-48; Clapp et al. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1998; 178(2):397-401; Nielsen et al., Biol Psychiatry. 2008; 64(11):974-81; and Hubbell et al., Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology 1995; 3(2): 123-128.
“Pain” is generally described in terms of duration, cause, and/or afflicted region of the body. The disclosure includes treatment of any type of pain, including neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain. Additional examples of pain include, but are not limited to, visceral pain, muscle pain, inflammatory pain, colicky pain, referred pain, and idiopathic pain. The method further includes treatment of, e.g., long term persistent pain, chronic pain, breakthrough pain, subacute pain, and acute pain. Acute pain is generally a self-limiting physiological response to a discrete bodily insult (e.g., inflammation, surgery, bone fracture, headache, sprain, strains, burn, or chemical exposure). Chronic pain persists longer than would be expected for healing from a discrete bodily insult, and includes disorders such as, e.g., back pain, myofascial pain, arthritis, cancer pain, neuropathic pain, and fibromyalgia.
Efficacy in treating (e.g., reducing, easing, suppressing, or alleviating) pain in a subject in need thereof is determined using any suitable method. Analgesic efficacy is measured, for example, using a nociception assay in animals such as a tail withdrawal test, pain relief score, or a pain intensity difference score, optionally recorded at a given time point, or over time, or as compared to a baseline, and includes calculations based on area under the curve such as those plotting Total Pain Relief Score (TOTPAR) or the Sum of Pain Intensity Difference (SPID), as described in the Handbook of Pain Assessment, 2d. Turk & Meldzack, Eds., The Guilford Press, New York, N.Y. (2001). Increases in time to re-medication and increases in quality of life measurements also are indicators of successful pain treatment.
“Treating” pain or an opioid receptor-associated disorder does not require a 100% abolition of pain or the disorder. Any decrease in pain sensation or symptoms of the disorder constitutes a beneficial biological effect in a subject. In this regard, the disclosure reduces pain or the symptoms of a MOR associated disorder and/or a DOR associated disorder by, e.g., at least about 5%, at least about 10% or at least about 20% compared to levels of, e.g., pain observed in the absence of the method (e.g., in a biologically-matched control subject, subject that is not administered the compound, or the subject administered the compound prior to treatment). In some embodiments, pain is reduced by at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, or at least about 60%. In some embodiments, the method inhibits pain by at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or more (about 100%) compared to that experienced in the absence of the method
Further provided is a method of treating a subject suffering from pain, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a composition as disclosed herein. In some cases, the pain is associated with a disease or condition selected from gastrointestinal motility disorders (e.g., constipation), seizures, depression, and cocaine dependence. In some embodiments, the method of treating pain is associated with a decreased risk of developing tolerance and dependence.
In various cases, the subject is a mammal. In some cases, the subject is human.
MOR agonism, DOR antagonism, and KOR agonism can be determined using any suitable assay, including assays that detect up- or down-regulation of G protein mediated signal transduction pathways associated with the opioid receptors. An exemplary assay is described in the Example, and entails measurement of radiolabeled GTP analogs produced by activated G proteins. Agonism is generally described in terms of potency, e.g., the concentration of compound required to achieve a 50% increase in G protein activity (and, by extension, opioid receptor activity). Agonism also generally described in terms of efficacy, e.g., the maximum level of G protein activity triggered by the compound. Efficacy often is reported as a percentage of the level of activity achieved by a “standard” receptor agonist (for example, DAMGO ([D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol]-enkephalin) for MOR or DPDPE ([D-Pen 2,D-Pen 5]-enkephalin) for DOR). Optionally, the compound enhances MOR-mediated G protein activation with a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of less than or equal to 1×10−7 M, less than or equal to 1×10−8 M, less than or equal to 1×10−9 M, or less than or equal to 1×10−10 M. A compound of Formula (I), in various embodiments, provides at least 10% max. stimulation of MOR (e.g., at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 35%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 55%, or at least 60% max. stimulation of MOR) in the [35 S]GTPyS stimulation assay described in the Example. In one aspect, the compound exhibits MOR agonism efficacy similar to that of morphine (e.g., the compound's % max. in the [35 S]GTPyS stimulation assay described in the Example is within 10% of the % max. calculated for morphine). Optionally, the compound is more potent at MOR-coupled G protein stimulation than morphine and/or endomorphin (e.g., 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, or 40-fold more potent than morphine measured using the [3J5JS]GTPyS stimulation assay described in the Example). A DOR antagonist does not activate G proteins itself and inhibits G protein activation by at least one DOR agonist. A DOR antagonist also preferably counteracts (e.g., reverses, lessens, or prevents) DOR agonist-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase.
Uses of the compounds of Formula (I) in the preparation of a medicament for treating pain, and to treat pain (e.g., as an analgesic) also are disclosed herein.
The disclosure herein will be understood more readily by reference to the following examples, below.
Examples
The following examples are provided for illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure.
Synthetic Procedures for Compounds of Formula (I)
General Experimental Procedures. All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without additional purification. To prepare P2O5/Al2O3 (w/w 50%), Al2O3 was placed in an oven at 120° C. for 24 h. After it reached room temperature in a desiccator, P2O5 was added in equal amounts. The compounds were mixed and returned to the desiccator for later use. Suzuki couplings were performed on a Discover S-class (CEM) microwave in a closed vessel with maximum power input of 300 W and temperature set at 110° C. for 10 min under the standard method from their Synergy software.

To a pear-shaped flask containing 4-1 (123 mg, 0.30 mmol, 1 equiv) under argon atmosphere was added (R)-2-methylpropane-2-sulfinamide (109 mg, 0.90 mmol, 3 equiv), followed by tetrahydrofuran (3 mL). Reaction flask was cooled to 0° C., then titanium tetraethoxide (0.38 mL, 1.80 mmol, 6 equiv) was added dropwise and stirred 5 min before returning reaction mixture to room temperature. A flame-dried reflux condenser under argon atmosphere was affixed, and the reaction vessel was heated at 75° C. for 48 hours. Reaction was cooled to room temperature, then transferred via syringe to a flame-dried round-bottom flask containing sodium borohydride (68 mg, 1.80 mmol, 6 equiv) in tetrahydrofuran (3 mL) under argon atmosphere stirred at −78° C. After washing pear-shaped flask with additional 1 mL tetrahydrofuran, the reaction was warmed to room temperature. After stirring for 2 hours, reaction was quenched with methanol and stirred 15 minutes before removing solvent under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was suspended in dichloromethane, then filtered through a plug of cotton and celite. The filtrate was reconcentrated, yielding crude intermediate 4-2, which was carried forward without characterization.

To a pear-shaped flask containing 4-2 was added 1,4-dioxane (6 mL) followed by concentrated hydrochloric acid (5 drops, excess) and stirred at room temperature for 60 minutes before removing solvent. Reaction residue was washed with diethyl ether and cooled to −20° C. before decanting liquids. Washed precipitate with ether and decanted again, then dried under reduced pressure. Precipitate was resuspended in 10% B and 90% A, and purified with a Biotage Isolera flash chromatography system using a C18 reverse phase column. A linear gradient from 0% B and 100% A to 100% B and 0% A over 10 minutes (10% per minute) with a flow rate of 45 mL/min was used to isolate 4-3. Solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and remaining aqueous solution was lyophilized to give 4-3 (30 mg, 0.05 mmol, 15% yield over 2 steps) as a white powder, >95% purity. Characterized by LC/MS and 1H, 13C and HSQC NMR in CD3OD.

To a pear-shaped flask containing 4-4 was added dichloromethane (5 mL), followed by trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 3 mL) and stirred at room temperature. After 30 minutes, solvent was removed and remaining residue was suspended in 10% Solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% TFA) and 90% Solvent A (water with 0.1% TFA), then filtered through a fine (4-5.5 micron) frit. Filtrate was purified with a Waters semi-preparative HPLC using a Vydac protein and peptide C18 reverse phase column. A linear gradient from 10% B and 90% A to 60% B and 40% A over 50 minutes (1% per minute) with a flow rate of 10 mL/min was used to isolate 4-5. Organic solvent was then removed under reduced pressure, and remaining aqueous solution was lyophilized to give 4-5 as a white powder, >95% purity. Characterized by 1H, 13C NMR and LC/MS. M+1 predicted: 505.35. Observed: N/A. Retention time: 26.8 minutes.
Biological Assay Data
Binding affinity is measured using any suitable technique, such as the competitive binding assays described in the Example; Przydzial et al., I. Pept. Res. 2005; 65(3):333-42; Balboni et al., I. Med. Chem. 2002; 45:5556-5563; Lazarus et al., I. Med Chem. 1991; 34: 1350-1359; Salvadori et al., I. Med. Chem. 1999; 42:5010-5019; and Balboni et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11:5435-5441. Alternative techniques for evaluating binding to MOR or DOR include, for example, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy, and confocal laser microscopy. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,661,913, and Cechetto et al., Exp Cell Res. 2000; 260:30-39
Additional examples of techniques for examining agonist and/or antagonist activity of a compound include, but are not limited to, the mouse vas deferens (MVD) bioassay of DOR bioactivity and the guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay of MOR activity, both of which are described in Sasaki et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2003; 11:675-678 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 20080269143. In vivo models for evaluating opioid receptor activity in response to opioid receptor modulators include but are not limited to, the tail flick test (Harris et al., J. Pharmacol. Meth. 1988; 20: 103-108; and Sing et al., P.A. Amber (v. 3.0. rev. A), Dept. Pharm. Chem., University of California, San Francisco (1988)) and the hot-plate test (see, e.g., Woolfe et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1944; 80:300-307).
In Vitro Pharmacology-Cell Lines and Membrane Preparations.
All tissue culture reagents were purchased from Gibco Life Sciences (Grand Island, N.Y., U.S.). C6-rat glioma cells stably transfected with a rat p (C6-MOR) or rat b (C6-DOR) opioid receptor20 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing a human K (CHO-KOR) opioid receptor21 were used for all in vitro assays. Cells were grown to confluence at 37° C. in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin. Membranes were prepared by washing confluent cells three times with ice cold phosphate buffered saline (0.9% NaCl, 0.61 mM Na2HPO4, 0.38 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4). Cells were detached from the plates by incubation in warm harvesting buffer (20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.68 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and pelleted by centrifugation at 200 g for 3 min. The cell pellet was suspended in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and homogenized with a Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products, Inc., Bartlesville, Okla., U.S.) for 20 s at setting 4. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20 000 g for 20 min at 4° C., and the pellet was rehomogenized in 50 mM Tris-HCl with a Tissue Tearor for 10 s at setting 2, followed by recentrifugation. The final pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl and frozen in aliquots at 80° C. Protein concentration was determined via Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard.
Radioligand Binding Assays.
Radioactive compounds were purchased from Perkin-Elmer (Waltham, Mass., U.S.). Opioid ligand binding assays were performed using competitive displacement of 0.2 nM [3H]diprenorphine (250 μCi, 1.85 TBq/mmol) by the test compound from membrane preparations containing opioid receptors. The assay mixture, containing membrane suspension (20 μg protein/tube) in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4), [3H]diprenorphine, and various concentrations of test peptide, was incubated at room temperature for 1 h to allow binding to reach equilibrium. The samples were rapidly filtered through Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, Md., U.S.) and washed three times with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer. The radioactivity retained on dried filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting after saturation with EcoLume liquid scintillation cocktail in a Wallac 1450 MicroBeta (Perkin-Elmer, Waltham, Mass., U.S.). Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 μM naloxone. Inhibitory constant (Ki) values were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis to fit a logistic equation to the competition data using GraphPad Prism, version 5.01, for Windows (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.). The results presented are the mean±standard error from at least three separate assays performed in duplicate.
Stimulation of [35S]GTPyS Binding. Agonist stimulation of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-[γ-thio]triphosphate ([35S]GTPγS, 1250 Ci, 46.2 TBq/mmol) binding was measured as described previously Briefly, membranes (10-20 μg of protein/tube) were incubated 1 h at room temperature in GTPyS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) containing 0.1 nM [35S]GTPγS, 30 μM guanosine diphosphate (GDP), and varying concentrations of test peptides. Peptide stimulation of [35S]GTPyS was compared with 10 μM standard compounds [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly-ol]encephalin (DAMGO) at MOR, D-Pen2,5-enkephalin (DPDPE) at DOR, or U.S. Pat. No. 69,593 at KOR. The reaction was terminated by rapidly filtering through GF/C filters and washing 10 times with GTPyS buffer, and retained radioactivity was measured as described above. The results presented are the mean±standard error from at least three separate assays performed in duplicate; maximal stimulation was determined using nonlinear regression analysis with GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, Calif.).
In Vivo Pharmacology. Animals.
Adult male C57BL/6 mice weighing between 20 and 30 g at 8-16 weeks old were used for the current experiments (obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Me.), Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind.), or bred in-house). Mice were group-housed and had free access to food and water at all times. Experiments were conducted in the housing room, which was maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle (with lights on at 0700). Each mouse was used only once and experiments were conducted between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Studies were performed in accordance with the University of Michigan Committee on the Use and Care of Animals and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011 publication).
Antinociception.
The antinociceptive effects of the compounds disclosed herein and morphine can be evaluated in the warm water tail withdrawal assay using a cumulative dosing procedure. To determine tail withdrawal latencies, each mouse was placed briefly into a plastic, cylindrical restrainer and 2-3 cm of the tail tip was placed into a water bath maintained at 50° C. The latency to withdraw the tail was recorded with a maximum cutoff time of 20 s. If the mouse did not remove its tail by the cutoff time, the experimenter removed its tail from the water to prevent tissue damage. Each animal received an injection of saline (intraperitoneal, ip) and then 30 min later, the baseline withdrawal latencies were recorded and ranged between 3 and 6 s. Following baseline determinations, three increasing doses (1, 2.2, and 6.8 mg/kg) of 1(4R) were given at 30 min intervals to provide final doses of 1, 3.2, and 10 mg/kg. Thirty minutes after each injection, the tail withdrawal latency was measured as described above. To confirm that 1(4R) was acting at opioid receptors, the cumulative dose response was repeated over the doses 3.2, 10, and 32 mg/kg following a 30 min pretreatment with 1 mg/kg naltrexone (ip). To determine the time-course of antinociceptive action the tail-withdrawal test was performed at varying times following administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, ip) or 1(4R) (10 mg/kg, ip). An indication of fully efficacious indicates that the mouse didn't withdraw tails up to the 20 second cut off time. An indication of partially efficacious indicates that the tail withdrawal of the mouse was prior to the 20 second cut off time but longer than the negative control time. An indication of inactive indicates that the tail withdrawal of the mouse was the same time as the negative control.
