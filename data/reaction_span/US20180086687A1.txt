TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to a method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids.
BACKGROUND ART
Conventionally, a production method using a halogenating agent such as bromine in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate (Patent Document 1) is proposed as a method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids. A production method using bromine to brominate benzoic acids at the 2-position in concentrated hydrochloric acid (Patent Document 2) is also proposed as a method for producing brominated benzoic acids.

Patent Document 2: WO 2012/077673
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION
Problem to be Solved by the Invention
However, the method according to Patent Document 1 requires a long time for a reaction, and furthermore, because of low purity of acquired 2-halogenated benzoic acids, the method is not sufficiently satisfactory. Although brominated benzoic acids can be acquired at high purity in the method according to Patent Document 2 as compared to the method in Patent Document 1, a long time is required for a reaction as in the method of Patent Document 1 and, since a large amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid is used together with a reaction raw material, the method has a poor volume efficiency and is not industrially advantageous.
For example, in either of the methods of Patent Documents 1 and 2, halogenation proceeds for benzoic acids of the reaction raw material at positions other than the 2-position, resulting in generation of plural types of regioisomers. Therefore, to acquire an intended compound at high purity, the purification must be conducted to separate the intended compound from these regioisomers after the reaction. However, since these regioisomers typically have physical properties extremely close to the intended compound (2-halogenated benzoic acids), the separation is difficult and becomes a barrier to obtaining the intended compound at high purity.
The present invention was conceived in view of the situations and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids capable of making a reaction time shorter and providing high regioselectivity (being highly selective).
Means for Solving Problem
The present inventors intensively studied a method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids. As a result, it was found that by reacting benzoic acids as a reaction raw material with a halogenating agent in the presence of an alkaline compound, the reaction promptly proceeds and 2-halogenated benzoic acids can highly selectively be acquired.
Therefore, the present invention includes the following preferred embodiments.

In the method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids of the present invention, the halogenating agent to be used is selected from the group consisting of iodinating agents, brominating agents, chlorinating agents, and mixtures thereof, for example. Specific examples include halogen molecules such as iodine, chlorine, and bromine, mixing halogen molecules such as bromine chloride (BrCl) and iodine bromide (IBr), haloimides such as N-chlorosuccinimide, N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), and DBH (1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin) and hypohalites such as sodium hypoiodite, sodium hypochlorite, and sodium hypobromite (NaBrO). The halogenating agent applicable to the present invention are not limited to the halogenating agents described above, and halogenating agents generally used in organic synthesis are usable. These halogenating agents may be used singly, or two or more of the halogenating agents may be used in combination. When two or more halogenating agents are used, halogenating agents having the same halogen species are preferably selected.
Among them, preferably, the halogenating agent is iodine, sodium hypoiodite, sodium hypobromite (NaBrO), N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), DBH (1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin), or bromine.
Although an amount of the halogenating agent to be used may be an amount allowing the reaction to sufficiently proceed and is not particularly limited, the amount is preferably 0.5 to 10 equivalents, more preferably 1.0 to 2.0 equivalents, relative to one equivalent of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1), from the viewpoint of economic efficiency etc. It is considered that the halogenating agent used in the method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids of the present invention is partially turned into and reacted as a hypohalous acid (HXO; where X represents a halogen atom).
The alkaline compound used in the present invention may be either an inorganic alkaline compound or an organic alkaline compound.
Preferably, the inorganic alkaline compound is used. Using the inorganic alkaline compound can make production more industrially advantageous because the compound is readily available and can easily be handled.
Examples of the inorganic alkaline compound include sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, disodium hydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, diammonium hydrogen phosphate, ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium borate, potassium borate, ammonia, etc.
Among them, preferable examples of the inorganic alkaline compound are sodium hydroxide and/or potassium hydroxide.
Examples of the organic alkaline compound include tetramethylammonium hydroxide, 2-hydroxyethyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monoisopropylamine, diisopropylamine, ethanolamine, etc.
These inorganic alkaline compounds and organic alkaline compounds may be used singly or in combination of two or more compounds.
The inorganic alkaline compound or the organic alkaline compound may be liquid or solid at normal temperature. From the viewpoint of improving the operability etc., when the alkaline compound is a solid, the compound is preferably used as an aqueous solution.
The concentration of the aqueous solution of the alkaline compound is preferably 1% by mass or more and 50% by mass or less, more preferably 10% by mass or more and 40% by mass or less, from the viewpoint of improving operability and economic efficiency. By setting the concentration of the aqueous solution of the alkaline compound in such a range, the benzoic acids serving as a reaction raw material can be reacted with the halogenating agent without deteriorating the volumetric efficiency.
In the method for producing according to the present invention, it is considered that although the reason is unknown, the reactivity of the benzoic acids is improved by forming salts of benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) by using the alkaline compound.
An amount of the alkaline compound to be used may be set to an amount allowing the reaction to sufficiently proceed depending on the halogenating agent to be used and is not particularly limited. In general, the amount is preferably 0.2 equivalents or more, more preferably 0.8 to 2.5 equivalents, relative to one equivalent of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1).
In the case of using the halogenating agent (such as the halogen molecules) generating a hydrogen halide etc. as a by-product, it may be necessary to suppress protonation of the salts of the benzoic acids by an acidic source such as a by-product hydrogen halide. Therefore, in the case of using the halogenating agent generating a hydrogen halide etc. as a by-product, preferably, 0.5 equivalents or more of alkaline compound are further used for each equivalent of the halogenating agent to be used in addition to the predetermined amount of the alkaline compound added for each equivalent of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1).
The 2-halogenated benzoic acids acquired according to the present invention are not particularly limited and are preferably 2-bromo-4,5-dialkylbenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4,5-dialkoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-3,5-dialkoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4-alkoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-5-alkoxybenzoic acid, more preferably 2-bromo-4,5-dimethylbenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4,5-diethylbenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4,5-diethoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-5-methoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-5-ethoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4-methoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-4-ethoxybenzoic acid, 2-bromo-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid, and 2-bromo-3,5-diethoxybenzoic acid.
In the method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids of the present invention, if the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) serving as a reaction raw material are liquid at a reaction temperature, the reaction raw material also acts as a solvent, and therefore, the reaction proceeds even without using a solvent. If the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) are solid at a reaction temperature, the reaction may be performed by using a solvent. Examples of the solvent to be used include water, an organic solvent, and a mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent. In the present invention, from the viewpoint of economy, safety, etc., the reaction is preferably performed in water and the mixed solvent of water and an organic solvent, and is more preferably performed by using water as a solvent from an environmental perspective.
When an organic solvent is used as the reaction solvent, although a kind of the organic solvent to be used is not particularly limited, a solvent inert to the halogenating agent is preferable. Examples of such a solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, carboxylic acids, and esters. These solvents may be used singly or in combination of two or more solvents. Examples of halogenated hydrocarbons include chlorobenzene, methylene chloride, chloroform, etc. Examples of ethers include saturated alkyl ethers and cyclic ethers, and specific examples of saturated alkyl ethers include ethyl ether, n-propyl ether, isopropyl ether, n-butyl ether, etc. Specific examples of cyclic ether include dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, etc. Examples of carboxylic acids include acetic acid, propionic acid, etc. Examples of esters include saturated alkyl ester, and specific examples of saturated alkyl ester include methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate, etc.
These solvents may be used singly, or two or more of the solvents may be mixed and used as a mixed solvent.
In the case of using the solvent, an amount of the solvent to be used is not particularly limited and, in both cases of using the solvent singly and as a mixed solvent, the amount is preferably 150 g or more, more preferably 300 g or more, per mol of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1). The amount of the solvent to be used is preferably 10,000 g or less, more preferably 3,000 g or less, per mol of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1). When the amount of the solvent to be used is 150 g or more per mol of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1), stirring is facilitated and, when the amount of the solvent to be used is 10,000 g or less, a drainage treatment is facilitated, which is preferable from the viewpoint of economic efficiency and environmental protection. If the benzoic acids serving as a reaction raw material are liquid at the reaction temperature, the solvent may not be used; however, the solvent is preferably used for facilitating stirring of a reaction system.
The method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids of the present invention is performed with the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) and the halogenating agent in the presence of the alkaline compound. When the reaction is performed, the reaction system is preferably stirred although the stirring may not be strong.
In the method for producing 2-halogenated benzoic acids of the present invention, the order of addition of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1), the halogenating agent, and the alkaline compound is not particularly limited.
Furthermore, the whole amount of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) may be added at one step, or may be divided and added in a plurality of steps. The same applies to the halogenating agent and the alkaline compound.
For example, when the whole amount of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) is introduced into a reaction vessel at one step, a portion or the whole amount of the alkaline compound may be added to the reaction vessel before, during, or after the introduction of the whole amount of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1) into the reaction vessel.
A portion or the whole amount of the halogenating agent may be added before, during, or after the introduction of a portion or the whole amount of the alkaline compound into the reaction vessel.
Although not particularly limited, the reaction temperature of the reaction between the benzoic acids and the halogenating agent in the presence of the alkaline compound is preferably −30 to 100° C., more preferably −15 to 60° C. By performing the reaction at −30° C. or higher, a sufficient reaction speed can be acquired. By performing the reaction at a temperature of 100° C. or less, the benzoic acids or the product, i.e., 2-halogenated benzoic acids, can be restrained from decomposing.
Although not particularly limited, the reaction time is typically 10 minutes to 4 hours at least after introduction of the whole amounts of the benzoic acids represented by Formula (1), the halogenating agent, and the alkaline compound into the reaction vessel.
After completion of the reaction, for example, the excessive halogenating agent may be reduced by using sodium sulfite, sodium thiosulfate, etc., before adding toluene, chlorobenzene, etc.
The reaction liquid obtained in this way is separated into an organic phase and an aqueous phase by a liquid separation operation to remove the organic phase, and the acquired aqueous phase can be isolated by crystallization (acid precipitation) or a method such as column chromatography so as to acquire 2-halogenated benzoic acids.
As described above, according to the present invention, since 2-halogenated benzoic acids can be acquired by an industrially advantageous method and the formation of regioisomers of 2-halogenated benzoic acids is suppressed in the reaction stage, 2-halogenated benzoic acids can highly selectively be produced.

Subsequently, at the liquid temperature of 25° C., 167.8 g (1.05 mol) of bromine was added dropwise at a liquid temperature of 20 to 30° C. Completion of the dropwise addition was followed by stirring for seven hours at a liquid temperature of 20 to 30° C. Subsequently, 3650 mL of water was added and stirred for one hour before precipitated crystals were collected by filtration.

The conditions and reaction results of Examples 1 to 10, and Comparative Examples 1, 2 are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, Compounds A to D are typical regioisomers (having different halogenation positions). Specifically, A denotes a 1,2-dibromo compound generated by a decarboxylation reaction; B denotes a 3-bromo-substituted compound; C denotes a 2,3-dibromo-substituted compound; and D denotes a 2,6-dibromo-substituted compound. For A to D described above, the acquired aqueous phase was analyzed by liquid chromatography to calculate a production amount thereof in each of Examples and Comparative Examples (“N.D.” in the table means Not Detectable).
For example, as can be understood from the Hunsdiecker reaction, it is known that a decarboxylation reaction progresses when carboxylic acids such as benzoic acids used in the present invention are reacted with bromine in general. The progress of the decarboxylation reaction may increase the necessary halogenating agent such as bromine or reduce the yield of the intended compound.
However, according to the results of Examples 1 to 10 of the present invention, since the yield of the acquired 2-halogenated benzoic acids is high and the problem of the reduced yield of the intended compound is not generated, it can be understood that the decarboxylation reaction is suppressed or has made almost no progress.
Therefore, as is apparent from Examples 1 to 10 of the present invention, the method of producing according to the present invention can suppress the decarboxylation reaction, has high regioselectivity, and can produce 2-halogenated benzoic acids in high yield.
Furthermore, by comparing the results of Examples of the present invention with the result of Comparative Example 1, it is found that by using the alkaline compound in a bromination reaction of benzoic acids, 2-halogenated benzoic acids can be acquired in short time and in high yield
According to the results of Examples of the present invention and Comparative Example 2, 2-halogenated benzoic acids are acquired in high yield. However, in Examples of the present invention, the halogenation reaction extremely promptly proceeds, and the acids can be acquired highly selectively and in the same level of yield.
Additionally, according to Comparative Example 2, a plurality of regioisomers (B, C, D, etc. in the table) halogenated at positions other than the 2-position of the benzene ring are generated as by-product. These regioisomers have physical properties similar to the intended compound (2-halogenated benzoic acid) and are therefore difficult to separate respectively from the intended compound. However, the compounds generated as by-products in Examples 1 to 10 are a decarbonized product with the carboxylic acid moiety eliminated from 2-halogenated benzoic acids and a dibromo compound with bromine further added to the decarbonized product (A in the table) and can easily be removed by a liquid separation operation etc. because of physical properties different from the intended compound.
Furthermore, according to Comparative Example 2, 3650 mL of 35% hydrochloric acid and 3650 mL of water (7300 mL in total) are used per mol of benzoic acids. However, for example, Examples 8 to 10 require only 103 mL of a 30% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution and 800 mL of water (903 mL in total) and are obviously industrially advantageous also from the viewpoint of volumetric efficiency.
