FIELD OF THE INVENTION
The present invention relates to the field of organic synthesis and catalysis. More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of formamide compounds by using clamped transition metal complexes as catalysts to perform the reaction between carbon dioxide, hydrogen and an amine compound.
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that affects the environment as well as an inexhaustible, cheap, safe and renewable carbon resource. In recent years, how to provide useful chemistry and chemical engineering products by using carbon dioxide as a carbon resource has attracted wide concern of governments and scientists while in-depth study has been carried out.
On the other hand, formamide compounds such as formamide, N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and N-formylmorpholine are very important chemical raw materials, solvents and pharmaceutical intermediates in which DMF is referred to as “universal solvent” which can also be used in the petrochemical industry as a gas absorbent for the separation and refining of gas; in addition, N-formyl morpholine is also an important formamide compound has a wide range of applications in industry, which can be used as a solvent in organic synthesis as well as the best extraction solvent for the separation of aromatic hydrocarbons and paraffin hydrocarbons to produce benzene with high purity (99.99%).
Commonly used methods to produce formamides in industry are formic acid method, methyl formate method, etc. The method for DMF is relatively special, which is mainly a carbon monoxide method, in which the main raw materials are synthesis ammonia, industrial methanol and carbon monoxide. At present, the raw materials for this method are of wide range of source, thus suitable for large-scale continuous production. Most of the large enterprises in United States, Japan and China use this method. However, in consideration of the large production and consumption of DMF, and the method based on non-renewable coal resources as raw material, the development of cleaner and reproducible production method is still necessary.
DMF can also be synthesized from CO2 as raw material, and formic acid obtained by hydrogen reduction of CO2 reacts with dimethylamine and is dehydrated to give DMF. But the catalyst developed later is of low efficiency, of which TON is 3400. Until 1994, Prof. NOYORI found that DMF can be synthesised in the supercritical carbon dioxide with tetra (trimethylphosphine) dichloro ruthenium complex as a catalyst at high efficiency, of which TON reached 4.2 million, but the total pressure of the supercritical reaction system is up to 210 atmospheric pressure, not only leading to high energy consumption, but also harsh requirement to the equipment and materials, so that the catalytic system is not suitable for practical applications in the industry. At the same time, the method is of poor substrate applicability due to the different solubility of amine in the supercritical carbon dioxide. Only a few formamide compounds can be synthesized in this way, such as dimethylamine, diethylamine and propylamine. In 2012, Prof. Cantat reported that polysilicate reagent can be used to reduce CO2 and reacts with several primary amine and secondary amine to prepare DMF and other formamide compounds. However, this method requires the use of equivalent amounts of silicon reagent which is of high cost, and when the substrate is a primary amine, it is prone to be over reduced, and of poor reaction selectivity.
Therefore, there is a need in the art for a new environmental friendly method for synthesizing formamide compounds which is of good substrate applicability, convenient use of catalyst, high production efficiency and suitable reaction conditions for industrial production, and low by-product pollution.

In the above table: the yield of N-methylmorpholine is determined by gas chromatography with p-xylene as internal standard.
As can be seen from Table 1, the change of temperature has a significant effect on the reaction results. The reaction can hardly proceed below 60° C., while the yield of the product reduced when the temperature is over 140° C. Therefore, the temperature in the reaction was between 110° C. to 130° C., preferably 120° C.

Steps similar to those in example 4 were employed, and ruthenium complex 1b was used as catalyst. At 120° C. and in the presence of CO2 and H2 at 30 atm and 20 atm, respectively, morpholine was stirred for 2 hours in different solvents in a reactor. The yield of N-formylmorpholine was determined by gas hromatography. The results are shown in table 2:

In the above table: the yield of N-methylmorpholine is determined by gas chromatography with p-xylene as internal standard.
As can be seen from Table 2, the reaction solvents have a significant influence on the yield of the product. In a polar solvent such as acetonitrile, methanol or THF, the product yield is from medium to good, while the yield in toluene is slightly lower, and no reaction occurs when solvent-free. Therefore, THF or methanol was used as the reaction solvent in further condition selection.

It can be seen from table 3 that the change of CO2 and H2 pressure has great influence on the reaction results. Under the pressure conditions shown in the table, the greatest catalyzing effect was achieved by 1b when both of CO2 and H2 are at 35 atm, in which the yield of N-Formylmorpholine can reach up to 75%.

In the above table: the yield of N-methylmorpholine is determined by gas chromatography with p-xylene as internal standard.
It can be seen from Table 4 that for the PNP tridentate pincer metal catalysts 1a-1h, 2a-2d, 3a, PNP tridentate ligand complexes 1a-1h can more efficiently catalyze morpholine formylation reaction than PNN and SNS tridentate ligand complexes (2a-2c, 3a) under the same reaction conditions. Therefore, the preferred catalyst is PNP-type tridentate ligand complex, more preferably a pincer tridentate ligand ruthenium complex 1a.

Steps similar to those in example 4 were employed, while ruthenium complex 1b was used as catalyst, and different amounts of potassium tert-butoxide as basic additive. Morpholine (20 mmol) and CO2 (35 atm) and H2 (35 atm) were reacted at 120° C. in THF solvent for 2 hours. The reaction results are shown in table 5:

In the above table: the yield of N-methylmorpholine is determined by gas chromatography with p-xylene as internal standard.
As can be seen from Table 5, the amount of base (potassium t-butoxide) used in this reaction did not significantly affect the catalytic effect. Since the reaction substrate morpholino itself is a organic base with strong basicity, there is no need to add additional base to activate ruthenium complex 1b, therefore, in subsequent preferred embodiment, alkali other than amine substrate was not added.

Under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box, Ruthenium complex 1b (0.6 mg, 0.01 mmol) and morpholine (4.404 g, 51 mmol) were added to a 125-mL Parr autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and taken out from the glove box, followed by the addition of carbon dioxide gas and hydrogen at 35 atm separately. After a few minutes, the total pressure of the gas in the autoclave was stably maintained at 60 atm. The reaction mixture in the autoclave was heated and stirred in an oil bath at 120° C. for 14 hours and then cooled to room temperature in a water bath. And then the remaining gas was slowly released in a fume hood to obtain a colorless solution. The yield of formyl morpholine was determined to be 95% by gas chromatography with p-xylene (50 μL) as internal standard.
