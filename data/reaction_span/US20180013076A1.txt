CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2016-0087600 filed on Jul. 11, 2016 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.
BACKGROUND
1. Field
One or more embodiments relate to a compound for an organic light-emitting device and an organic light-emitting device including the same.
2. Description of the Related Art
Organic light-emitting devices are self-emission devices that produce full-color images, and also have wide viewing angles, high contrast ratios, and short response times, and excellent characteristics in terms of brightness, driving voltage, and response speed, compared to devices in the art.
As an example, such organic light-emitting devices may include a first electrode disposed on a substrate, and a hole transport region, an emission layer, an electron transport region, and a second electrode, which are sequentially disposed on the first electrode. Holes provided from the first electrode may move toward the emission layer through the hole transport region, and electrons provided from the second electrode may move toward the emission layer through the electron transport region. Carriers, such as holes and electrons, recombine in the emission layer to produce excitons. These excitons transition from an excited state to a ground state, thereby generating light.
SUMMARY
One or more embodiments include a novel condensed cyclic compound and an organic light-emitting device including the same.

In one or more embodiments, the emission layer may have a stacked structure including a red emission layer, a green emission layer, and a blue emission layer, or may include a red-light emission material, a green-light emission material, and a blue-light emission material, which are mixed with each other in a single layer, to emit white light.
The emission layer may include a host and a dopant. The dopant may include at least one selected from a phosphorescent dopant and a fluorescent dopant.
An amount of the above dopant in the emission layer may be typically in a range from about 0.01 to about 15 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight o the host, but embodiments are not limited thereto.
A thickness of the emission layer may be in a range from about 100 Å to about 1,000 Å, for example, about 200 Å to about 600 Å. When the thickness of the emission layer is within any of these ranges, excellent light-emission characteristics may be obtained without a substantial increase in driving voltage.

Example 1
An anode was manufactured by cutting a Corning 15 Ω/cm2 (1,200 Å) ITO glass substrate to a size of 50 mm×50 mm×0.7 mm, ultrasonically cleaning the glass substrate by using isopropyl alcohol and pure water for 5 minutes each, and then, irradiating UV light for 30 minutes thereto and being exposed to ozone to clean. Then, the anode electrode was loaded into a vacuum deposition apparatus.
Then, 2-TNATA was vacuum deposited on the anode to form a hole injection layer having a thickness of 600 Å, and then, 4,4'-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (hereinafter, also referred to as NPB), which is a known hole transport compound, was vacuum deposited on the hole injection layer to form a hole transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, thereby completing the formation of a hole transport region.
On the hole transport region, Compound 1 and N,N,N',N'-tetraphenyl-pyrene-1,6-diamine (TPD), which is a known blue fluorescent dopant, were co-deposited at a weight ratio of 98:2 to form an emission layer having a thickness of 300 Å.
Then, Alq3 was deposited on the emission layer to form an electron transport layer having a thickness of 300 Å, and then, LiF, which is a halogenated alkali metal, was deposited on the electron transport layer to form an electron injection layer having a thickness of 10 Å, and Al was deposited thereon to a thickness of 3,000 Å (cathode), thereby forming an LiF/Al electrode and completing the manufacturing of an organic light-emitting device.

Referring to Table 2, it was confirmed that the organic light-emitting devices of Examples 1 to 9 had improved driving voltage, brightness, efficiency, and half lifespan, compared to those of the organic light-emitting devices of Comparative Examples 1 and 2.
As described above, a novel condensed cyclic compound has excellent light-emission characteristics and charge transport capability, and thus may be suitable as a light-emitting material or a charge transport material, for fluorescent and phosphorescent devices of all colors, such as red, green, blue, and white. An organic light-emitting device including the condensed cyclic compound may accordingly have high efficiency, low voltage, high brightness, and long lifespan.
It should be understood that embodiments described herein should be considered in a descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Descriptions of features or aspects within each embodiment should typically be considered as available for other similar features or aspects in other embodiments.
While one or more embodiments have been described with reference to the figures, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope as defined by the following claims.
